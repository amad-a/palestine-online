      <p class="MsoBodyText"><b>To our Arab and Islamic masses everywhere �</b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">The so-called
      Zionist supreme court of justice yesterday passed a ruling allowing the
      fanatic Jewish organization that calls itself the temple mount faithful to
      lay down the foundation stone of the alleged third temple at the Maghareba
      gate, which is adjacent to the holy Aqsa Mosque.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">The ruling
      coincided with statements for some of their rabbis that describe Arabs as
      ants and allow the cold-blooded assassination of our Palestinian people.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">The ruling also
      fell in line with the terrorist Sharon government�s repressive measures
      including the siege, starvation, assassination, abduction, demolition of
      houses, destroying farmland, wrecking premises, mass murders and massacres
      against our steadfast and unarmed people. The ruling also falls in line
      with feverish Zionist attempts to judaize the city of Al-Quds, demolish
      the Aqsa Mosque and erase any Arab-Islamic relics there through
      excavations and tunnels that were built at the pretext of looking for
      ancient ruins as a preliminary step to endorse the holy city as a capital
      of their usurping entity.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">Terrorist Sharon
      paved the way for his terrorist era with the desecration of the Aqsa
      plaza, which ignited our people�s intifada since that date. The Aqsa
      intifada and the brave resistance then erupted shaking Zionist security
      and defeating Sharon�s plan. Here he is today completing what he started
      yesterday believing that our Arab and Islamic nation had lost all valor
      and determination.<o:p>

      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">Our Palestinian
      people, who are daily presenting greatest models in sacrifice and heroism
      and who are backed by their Arab and Islamic Nation, are capable of

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">1-we urge our
      people with their forces and factions to gather at an early hour tomorrow
      at the Aqsa Mosque and its yards to resist any attempt to lay down the
      foundation stone of the alleged temple and to defend the Aqsa with soul
      and blood.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">2-we affirm the
      importance of unity of the Palestinian people in confrontation of
      occupation and its dangerous decision and the necessity of breaking all
      contacts and meetings with that enemy and giving up once and for all any
      form of security coordination with it. We also call for ending detentions
      under any political or security pretexts for the sake of serving the enemy
      or in response to its demands.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">3-we invite our
      Arab and Islamic peoples to express their anger and dismay at the Zionist
      decision. We urge them to reject it and to condemn the international
      forces, especially America, which back that enemy, and to pressure the
      Arab and Islamic governments to adopt an immediate and decisive position
      against the terrorist Sharon government and his court�s oppressive
      ruling.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">4-we call on the
      Arab and Islamic countries to denounce the Zionist court�s ruling and
      adopt immediate steps to condemn that ruling on the part of the
      international community. We also request them to announce a comprehensive
      boycott of the Zionist entity on all political, diplomatic, economic and
      other levels.<o:p>

      <p class="MsoBodyText"><span style="font-weight:normal">5-we re-affirm our
      call on the Arab and Islamic countries to endorse a political resolution
      supporting the resistance program against Zionist occupation and
