      <p class="MsoTitle" align="center"><i>In the name of Allah the most
      Gracious the most Merciful</i></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b><i>'say:
      &quot;Can you expect for us (any fate) other than one of two glorious
      things (martyrdom or victory)? But we can expect for you either that Allah
      will send His punishment from Himself, or by our hands. So wait
      (expectant); we too will wait with you.&quot;�<o:p>

      <p align="center"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Blood of martyr commander Abu
      Hannoud says:<br>
      Resistance is our option �</b></font></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our heroic Palestinian
      people:</b> a star has fallen from the skies of Palestine but its
      splinters would burn the heart of Zionists. Who will stop the burning sea
      waves after him? Who will deter the angered (avenging) heroes? Who will
      dare halt the blood-painted revenge? Who will stop the roaring lions? The
      Qassam Brigades will make out of Zionists charred wood.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">The martyr commander was
      the knight that annoyed occupation; its soldiers and settlers in all areas
      of Palestine and his students have learnt from him the arts of combat and
      graduated from his school with distinction. They realize that the time has
      come now to play their role and teach the Zionists unforgettable lessons
      so that they would know that if a knight had fallen a group of cavaliers
      would show up after him. Our people enjoy solid spirit and will remain,
      with Allah's fate, spreading fear in hearts of the Zionists � <b><i>�How
      many of the Prophets fought (in Allah's way), and with them (fought) large
      bands of godly men? But they never lost heart if they met with disaster in
      Allah's way, nor did they weaken (in will) nor give in. And Allah loves
      those who are firm and steadfast.�</i></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our patient Palestinian
      people:</b> the heinous crime perpetrated by the Zionist terrorist leaders
      in assassinating commander of the Qassam Brigades the martyr Mujahid hero
      Mahmoud Abu Hannoud and his brothers Ayman and Ma�moon Hashayka will not
      pass unpunished. God willing, they will regret the very hour in which they
      decided to assassinate those heroes. Our patience has gone out of limits
      and that arrogant enemy had bypassed all bounds taking cover behind the
      international community and depending on the state of Arab weakness. The
      enemy was also hiding behind the so-called ceasefire that did not serve as
      a cover for anyone. It is committing one massacre after the other against
      our heroes, children, elderly and women. It is thus imperative that our
      people should not heed false promises voiced by the biggest patron of
      terrorism nor the suspicious calls for calming down the situation voiced
      by arrogant countries. Those countries are quick to denounce any of our
      Mujahideen's operations against the Zionist enemy, charging our people
      and intifada with terrorism but they are totally silent while viewing our
      children's scattered remains in the roads leading to their schools.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Our Mujahid Palestinian
      people:</b> we in the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, bear with pride
      and glory the glad tidings of the martyrdom of commander Mahmoud Abu
      Hannoud and his brothers, a thing that they have always yearned for after
      he and his brothers managed to survive the enemy's various assassination
      and arrest attempts for years. We vow before Allah to remain faithful to
      blood of the martyr and all martyrs of our people and we will remain
      insisting on resistance until end and ejection of occupation from our
      lands sacrificing our souls and blood as cheap price along that road.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" align="center" style="text-align:center"><b>And it is
      a Jihad until either victory or martyrdom<o:p>
