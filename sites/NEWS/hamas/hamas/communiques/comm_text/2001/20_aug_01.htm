      <p class="MsoBodyText">Zionist aggression against our people witnessed a
      new escalation in the past few days represented in intensifying storming
      operations of Palestinian cities and the assassination of more intifada
      activists. The step follows the moral and security defeat that befell the
      Zionist occupation at the hands of the martyr heroes who blew up the
      Zionist security theory and proved failure of terrorist Sharon's
      government in achieving security for Zionist occupiers. Following the Quds
      and Haifa operations that terrorized the Zionists, Sharon resorted to
      political steps such as occupying the �Orient House� then followed it
      with escalation in military aggression that led to the martyrdom of
      numerous Palestinians. In a single day, yesterday Sunday, six Palestinians
      were martyred in Rafah, Gaza and Nablus including two small children in a
      fresh cold-blooded massacre by the occupation army. Such escalation aims
      at increasing pressures on our people and pushing them to despair in order
      to abandon<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>resistance against
      occupation in addition to pressuring the Palestinian Authority to return
      to effective security coordination and resume policy of detention of
      Palestinian freedom fighters. The PA actually responded by arresting a
      number of Hamas cadres at the pretext of having links to the martyrdom
      operation in Al-Quds. In the light of such Zionist escalation and
      aggression, the Zionist enemy circulated possibility of resuming political
      talks with the PA. A number of Arab parties also exerted efforts in a bid
      to revive the negotiations. Faced by such developments we would like to
      affirm the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1) The escalation of
      Zionist terrorism and aggression against our people reflects the Zionist
      occupation and the Sharon government's misery and moral defeat. They are
      trying to score illusionary victories over the Palestinian people to
      preserve their existence and cohesion.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2) The Zionist enemy's
      signs about political negotiations with the PA and readiness to accept a
      political settlement in addition to activating role of terrorist Peres in
      the light of continuation and escalation of repression, terrorism and
      aggression aims to distract the attentions and to ensure international
      support for criminal Sharon's policies and terrorism.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3) We affirm the
      importance of unity of our people on the option of intifada, resistance
      and steadfastness in its capacity as the sole option capable of ejecting
      occupation and putting an end to Zionist aggression and terrorism God
      willing.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4) Returning to
      discussions on reviving negotiations with the Zionist enemy and resuming
      the so-called peace process is a stab in the back of the blessed intifada
      and lets down our people's Jihad, brave resistance and martyrs� blood.
      Our people did not indulge in this intifada and resistance and did not
      offer martyrs and sacrifices only to submit to the criminal enemy's
      demands and return to humiliating negotiation with it. Any step in this
      direction on the part of any Palestinian or Arab party would be met with
      anger on the part of our people along with the Arab and Islamic peoples.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">5) We affirm that
      resistance would persist and escalate and that the criminal Zionist enemy
      would never know sleep or security as long as occupation continued. Our
      stationed Palestinian people will not take heed of suspicious calls voiced
      by defeatists to halt resistance or martyrdom operations under weak
      pretexts. Persistence of occupation and its daily bloodbaths against our
      people boost the necessity for escalation of resistance and continuation
      of martyrdom operations.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText">6) We denounce the state of Arab and Islamic
      impotency in face of the Zionist aggression. We invite the Arab and
      Islamic peoples to restore their role in support of their Palestinian
      brothers. We also urge the Arab and Islamic governments to shoulder their
      responsibility in resisting aggression and adopt serious practical steps
      in confrontation of Sharon and his terrorist gang and not to remain
      captive to losing bets on the American role. It is high time for the Arab
      and Islamic countries to sever all kinds of relations and contacts with
      the Zionist enemy and to pressure the American administration through its
      interests in the region.</p>
