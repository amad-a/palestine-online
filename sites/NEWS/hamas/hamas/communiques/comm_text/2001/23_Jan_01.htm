      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">It is not
      strange that the Zionist enemy would be surprised by severity of the
      Mujahideen and fighters� strikes. It is also not strange that Zionist
      leaders would stand powerless in face of the holy Aqsa intifada. Lessons
      of history and the present prove that peoples under occupation equipping
      themselves with steadfastness, patience and force,<span dir="RTL"> </span>who
      revolt on the basis of unity and understanding then make of their blood
      and sacrifices a bridge to cross to their just goals, eventually realize
      victory and actualize aspirations.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">Our Mujahid
      people, with the testimony of contemporary history and our blessed
      intifada, have proven a great ability to forebear sacrifices and
      difficulties and to bypass siege, terrorism and starvation. Our people
      maintained their faithful pledge with Allah and Nation to persist along
      the road not fearing tyranny, conspiracies or attempts to undermine the
      glorified intifada.</p>
      <p style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Our
      Mujahid people � our glorified Nation</font></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>It is utterly dismaying to witness the feverish racing to the
      absurd negotiations and keenness on security meetings at a time when our
      people are still the target of one of the cruelest Zionist terrorist
      offensive and the most savage attacks by Jewish settlers. Such practice
      includes burning houses, destroying crops and terrifying civilians in
      front of the very eyes of the whole world such as what took place in the
      Mawasi area of Khan Younis, in Al-Mighraka, Khalil and other Palestinian
      cities and villages. Moreover, the negotiating process contradicts our
      people's unanimous concordance on continuation in the struggle and
      intifada and rejection of all forms of talks or meetings with the Zionist
      enemy, which we consider as wasting our people's sufferings and blood
      just for the sake of beautifying the enemy's ugly face while addressing
      a bad message to the world.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">It is
      surprising that such meetings are quickening as the Palestinian Authority
      is proposing marathon negotiations in Taba within framework of the
      document tabled by the outgoing American president Bill Clinton to save
      terrorist Barak from his ordeal and market him as the best one to make
      peace in the upcoming Zionist elections. Certain politicians� attempt to
      support Barak's election chances compared to terrorist Sharon after the
      former's missile and tanks� bombardment of residential quarters,
      assassination of Mujahideen and honorable figures and the siege of our
      people is an encroachment on blood of martyrs, sufferings of the wounded
      and the deprived. It also serves as a deadly arrow directed at our
      intifada and people in addition to turning the back to our Arab and
      Islamic Nation that stands in one trench in backing of our people and
      their Jihad.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5">The Islamic
      Resistance Movement, Hamas, while affirming, at this historical stage, its
      rejection and condemnation of any agreement or understanding infringing on
      our legitimate and historic rights in holy Palestine and on the return of
      our people to their lands and homes, calls for the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><u><font color="#0000FF">First:
      on the Arab and Islamic level:</font><o:p>
      </o:p>
      </u></b></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">First:</font></b>
      Hamas urges the Arab and Islamic peoples to show more support and
      solidarity with the Aqsa intifada on the political, informational,
      material and moral levels and to revive the economic boycott of the
      Zionist enemy and refuse any form of meeting or coordination with it in
      addition to declaring rejection of any attempt aimed at liquidating the
      Palestine cause.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Second</b>:</font>
      On the tenth anniversary of the oppressive siege, Hamas asks the Arab and
      Islamic countries to break the siege on the Iraqi Muslim people.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Third</b>:</font>
      We appeal to Sheikh of Al-Azhar Dr. Mohammed Tantawi to rescind his
      invitation to visit Al-Quds and the Aqsa under Zionist occupation since
      the call contradicts the Fatwa of the Azhar Ulamah (religious scholars)
      and similar ones by the Nation's Ulamah. Furthermore, the Zionist enemy
      would exploit such a call to endorse its aggression and occupation; it
      would also encourage Zionist arrogance. We believe that any form of
      support to the intifada and the Aqsa should be displayed in the Nation's
      backing of our people with arms and elements of steadfastness rather than
      visiting the Aqsa under occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Fourth</b>:</font>
      We request all forces, parties and institutions in the Arab and Islamic
      world to organize activities in support of our people and our Nation's
      rights in Al-Quds and the holy Aqsa Mosque along with our people's right
      of return to their lands from which they were forcibly evacuated and to
      publicize such issues on all occasions.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><u><font color="#0000FF">Second:

      The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, asks the PA to respond to the
      popular and factional stand that calls for ending the absurd negotiations
      with the Zionist enemy and to stop beautifying face of the mass murderer
      Barak and covering up for his crimes under unacceptable justifications. We
      affirm that any agreement infringing on our legitimate rights in holy
      Palestine, in Al-Quds and the Aqsa will be rejected by our people and will
      not be binding to future generations but rather will carry seeds of its
      annulment and will not withstand for long regardless of any attempt to
      beautify or market it.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><font color="#0000FF"><b>Second:</b>
      </font>Hamas appeals to the PA not to have pending hopes on the new
      American administration under president Bush, affirming the importance of
      depending on Almighty Allah's invincible power then on the potentials of
      our people and Nation and to deepen our unity in the trench of the
      intifada and resistance.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Third</font>:</b>
      Hamas urges the PA to firmly deal with the phenomenon of collaborators,
      stressing the importance of purging our people from their dirt and
      corruption. Hamas draws the PA's attention to the necessity of dealing
      with the root of the problem on all levels and with all means in
      accordance to justice, religious commitment and legal discipline away from
      suspicion so as to avoid confusion and strife.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Fourth:</font></b>
      Hamas denounces security meetings and demands the PA to stop all forms of
      security coordination with the enemy, which leads to foiling our
      people's Jihad and intifada in addition to harming our cause and rights.
      The Movement also calls for releasing all the detained Mujahideen who are
      still in PA jails in a bid to boost our people's steadfastness in
      confrontation of the enemy and to defeat occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Fifth:</font></b>
      Hamas advocates activating our people's right of return including
      holding conferences and rallies in Palestine and in camps in the diaspora
      to ascertain the right of return and to reject all projects aimed at
      liquidating that right under any circumstances. We appreciate in this
      sphere our people's moves in the homeland and the diaspora and their
      insistence on the right of return and their unanimity on rejecting
      anything that might reduce or prune that right.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Sixth</font>:</b>
      Hamas hails our people and the blessed intifada as well as all Mujahideen
      and strugglers who are striking the enemy at the confrontation lines and
      in depth. Hamas also salutes the Qassam heroic martyr the hero of the
      martyrdom operation in Natanya Hamed Abu Hajle and the Qassam Brigades
      especially their latest operation that targeted a Zionist tank. We call on
      our people to launch more resistance operations and to activate all forms
      of economic boycott of Zionist and American products.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="margin-top: 5; margin-bottom: 5"><b><font color="#0000FF">Seventh:</font></b>
      Hamas affirms its stable stance towards national unity on the basis of
      resistance and escalation of the intifada. The Movement hails
      steadfastness of our heroes in jails of the Zionist occupation who are
      facing the most brutal forms of repression and we affirm to them that our
      people back them until their freedom is achieved.</p>
