      </b></p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">Western, particularly American, efforts are
      ongoing these days in an attempt to abort our Palestinian people's
      intifada under the guise of the so-called ceasefire. Western and American
      emissaries are flowing into the region in feverish efforts to pressure the
      Palestinian Authority to accept the Zionist dictates and conditions aimed
      at aborting our Palestinian people's intifada and right to resisting
      occupation in addition to turning our people's conflict with the Zionist
      entity into inter-Palestinian fighting.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2">The Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, would like
      to explain its stand towards those feverish efforts through the following
      points:</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText2"><b>First</b>: Despite the elapse of more than
      eight months on the occupation repression, under Sharon and earlier
      Barak's governments against our unarmed Palestinian people and despite
      the martyrdom of more than 500 and the wounding of more than 25,000 of our
      unarmed people and the vast destruction caused by the mass destruction
      weapons and the internationally-banned lethal arms that resulted in
      destruction of houses, property and plantations yet those efforts did not
      intensify until our people's intifada and their brave resistance started
      to drain the usurping enemy. Until fear and confusion were spread in the
      enemy lines especially after failure of Sharon's aggressive plan to
      subdue our people and foil their comprehensive popular intifada and
      restore security to the Zionists.</p>
      <p class="MsoBodyText3">This timing and this concentration of pressures on
      the PA only meant absolute support to Zionist aggression and occupation
      with all its beastly qualities and inhuman practices. This is refused on
      the part of our people of all walks of life and affiliations. Our people
      will not submit but would rather insist more than ever to continue the
      intifada and escalate resistance against occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Second</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">:
      Such feverish attempts and their proposals under the title of ceasefire
      are contrary to truth, justice and logic in addition to ignoring the core
      of our people's cause. They also indicate blatant siding with the brutal
      occupation's conditions. In this respect we would like to explain the
      following:<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">1-
      The ceasefire was a false and deceptive slogan for the crisis is not
      between two warring and neighboring parties so that it would be contained
      through ceasing hostilities. In fact it is an aggression by a ruthless
      occupying power against an unarmed people who are liable to the cruelest
      repressive measures and who are suffering from huge human and material
      losses. Occupation is the highest degree of terrorism, violence and
      aggression. The treatment should now focus on halting that aggression and
      ending occupation. Any other solution would never solve a crisis or lead
      to peace and stability. Talking about a ceasefire is a real disaster on
      our people because it would mean ending the intifada and resistance while
      retaining and protecting occupation in addition to wasting our people's
      great sacrifices without any gains and aborting all intifada
      accomplishments and effects.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">2-
      The international pressures that culminated with those of CIA chief George
      Tenet, on the PA to arrest intifada and resistance heroes and collecting
      their weapons along with banning any anti-occupation campaigns and
      resuming security coordination and cooperation (all being Sharon's
      demands) clearly reflected the open American administration's backing to
      this government against the PA and our people, who are the oppressed
      party. It is a biased and condemned stance that is not accepted by our
      people.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">3-
      The Mitchell committee's report was far from truth, oppressed our people
      and dealt with occupation through selective issues and that is why we
      along with our people's forces rejected it. The international efforts
      emanated from that report despite the fact that George Tenet's proposals
      overlooked the report's point on halting Zionist settlements. Such a
      fact reveals that the report and the efforts of Tenet and the others, who
      visited the region at the advice of the American administration, were
      nothing but an obvious deceptive attempt to abort our Palestinian
      people's intifada and end their legitimate anti-occupation resistance,
      which is a matter that cannot be sold to our people.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">Third</span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">:
      The PA's approval, under the yoke of pressures and fears of
      international embarrassment, of the Mitchell committee's report, that
      was turned down by all sectors of our people via statements and massive
      marches of national and Islamic forces on numerous occasions, had
      encouraged or lured the international mediators to exercise more pressures
      on the PA, which is now in a very critical situation. Insinuations of
      accepting freezing of settlements in return for halting the intifada,
      based on Mitchell's disastrous equation that aimed at ending our
      people's intifada and inciting strife in their lines, had increased such
      pressures. The PA should be courageous enough and loyal to the blood and
      sacrifices of our people and stick to one demand that is departure of the
      occupiers from our lands, Quds (Jerusalem) and holy shrines. If the PA
      insists on this demand we, along with all our people's forces, will be
      on its side on the basis of continuation of intifada and resistance until
      ejection of occupation.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify;text-kashida:0%"><span style="mso-bidi-font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-family:&quot;Times New Roman&quot;">The
      PA today must absorb past lessons and the intifada lesson. It should not
      deal with initiatives and projects that do not take into account our
      people's rights in full headed by their unanimity on defeat of
      occupation. Our people's sole option is continuation of the intifada and
      resistance of occupation and insistence on its expulsion from our lands.
      Whoever challenges this fact will be the loser.<o:p>
      </o:p>
      </span></p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fourth</b>: The
      international community must duly realize that the Sharon government is
      one of occupation, aggression, terrorism, strife and instability. This
      government does not hide its ugly face despite Peres� talented roles or
      public relations profession. It declares ceasefire yet that government's
      racist army daily murders our people's women, children and elderly and
      its intelligence teams assassinate intifada activists and resistance
      fighters. Its settlers terrorize our people, demolish their houses and
      uproot their streets before the very eyes of the whole world. This
      government should not be dealt with in accordance with reason but rather
      on the basis of an occupation, expansionist and aggressive government. The
      only solution to spare the region and the world evils of its policies and
      aggressions is to exercise pressures on it through continuation of the
      intifada and resistance until it is forced to end occupation of our lands
      and holy places.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Fifth</b>: We in the
      Hamas Movement along with all of our people's forces <span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp;</span>declare the following:</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">1- We condemn and reject
      George Tenet's demands and declare that our people will foil them as
      they did with previous conspiracies. We also refuse any similar oppressive
      effort from a superpower or a friendly or sisterly country.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">2- While realizing the
      international pressures on the PA, we do not agree with its approval on
      George Tenet's proposals and denounce it. We affirm that such an
      approval does not bind our people's national and Islamic forces or us.
      We urge the PA to revoke its stand and to turn down those pressures and
      proposals that only serve the enemy's interests. We assert that the
      country, its future and people's rights should not be for bargaining
      with any party regardless of its tyranny or threats. We underline that our
      people's rights, interests, sacrifices and national unity should be
      taken into consideration rather than foreign pressures and the enemy's
      threats, dictates and security priorities.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">3- We affirm our
      people's insistence on resisting occupation regardless of circumstances
      or conditions and announce, with the support of all our people's forces,
      our persistence in the intifada and resistance program until defeat of
      occupation.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify">4- We, along with our
      Mujahid people and various factions, refuse under any pretext the return
      to the security cooperation and coordination march with occupation along
      with political and security arrests and disarming the people. Our people
      will never allow this to happen because that notorious march was a crime
      against our people, encroached on national unity and wasted all sacrifices
      and accomplishments over the past months.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
      </span>Terrorist Sharon and his criminal government should know that their
      efforts and plots to drive wedges amongst our people and to convert the
      struggle into inter-Palestinian fighting would not succeed God willing.
      Our people with all its forces are well aware of such plots and are
      insisting on national unity that was endorsed in the Aqsa intifada.
      Sharon's conspiracy will reflex on him and our people's Mujahideen and
      resistance heroes� reprisal would be violent against Zionist occupation.
      The resistance's retaliation would be stronger whenever the enemy's
      incitement increased.</p>
      <p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b>Sixth</b>: We laud the
      Arab and Islamic governments that supported our people's right in
      persisting in the intifada and resistance until liberation of the lands
      and holy shrines and we urge all those governments to turn down and foil
      western and American mediations as long as they were not based on justice
      and right namely in ridding our people from occupation. We also ask them
      to clearly include protection and support of the intifada and resistance
      in their political programs and stands in its capacity not only as a
      Palestinian interest but also as an Arab and Islamic interest in face of
      the Zionist danger and ambition. We further invite our Arab and Islamic
      masses to intensify their activity and programs in solidarity with our
      people and in support of their intifada and resistance along with
      rejecting all projects aimed at aborting our people's struggle and
      legitimate Jihad against occupation.</p>
