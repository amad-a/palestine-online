<p class="MsoBodyText2"><img border="0" src="images/aqsa1.jpg" align="right" width="300" height="214">I
have found out that many Muslims do not have the proper knowledge about the holy
Aqsa Mosque and its exact area and buildings. I have noted with regret that many
Muslims are ignorant about that matter. During my trips abroad, my participation
in Islamic conferences and through meeting with many Muslims during Haj and Omra
seasons, I noted that the Muslims have a wrong idea about that holy Mosque. Some
believe that the Dome of the Rock is the Aqsa Mosque and some believe that the
Marwani Mosque is another building that has nothing to do with the holy Aqsa
Mosque and some are mixed up over the term “Aqsa Mosque” and “Old Aqsa”.
Hence, I resolved that it was necessary to write on this issue, which I do not
excuse any Muslim or Arab on Earth for ignoring because ignorance is the sad
beginning of losing the holy Aqsa!</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">On the other hand, knowing and
understanding such information is a necessary introduction towards preserving
the holy Aqsa Mosque purified, dignified and liberated against the wishes of the
atheists. That is why I ask myself and ask all Muslims and Arabs: “What is the
Holy Aqsa?”</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" align="center"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:

</o:p>
</span><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#0000FF">Aqsa
means all that is within the walls</font></span></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Mujeerul Deen Al-Hanbaly (in his book
Al-Ons Al-Jaleel) writes: “It is common among people that the Aqsa is the one
located towards the Qibla, the mosque constructed in the foremost area including
the pulpit and the big mihrab (prayer niche), while the truth is that the Aqsa
is the name of all what is within its compound inside the walls … the building
in the foremost area and others, Dome of the Rock, corridors and others, the
Aqsa means all that is within the walls.” Al-Dabbagh in his book “Al-Quds”
wrote: “The Haram Al-Sharif is composed of two mosques the Dome of the Rock
and the Aqsa Mosque along with what is between and surrounding them of various
installations up to the surrounding walls.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Based on this we clearly realize that
all of the area within the holy Aqsa’s compound is part and parcel of the Aqsa
Mosque along with the walls surrounding it. Meaning that the walls and all their
gates are part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque. The western wall for example is
part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque and the Buraq Wall, which is considered part
of the western wall, is part and parcel of the Mosque. Ribat Al-Kurd, which is
also part of the western wall is part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque along with
all gates in the western wall such as the Maghareba gate and all buildings along
the western wall such as the Tankziye School are all part and parcel of the Aqsa
Mosque! I am sure that many Muslims are ignorant of those facts but it is a duty
to know them! Those who know those facts will realize that there is a flagrant
violation on the Aqsa Mosque until our present time! The conversion of the Buraq
Wall, which is part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque, into what they call today
(out of illusion and deception) the “Wailing Wall” is a constant flagrant
aggression against the Aqsa Mosque! The Zionist ministry of religions’
announcement years ago of its intention to convert the Ribat Al-Kurd, which is
part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque, into what they called the mini Wailing Wall
project was a constant and flagrant aggression against the Aqsa Mosque! The
occupation army’s closure of the Maghareba gate, which is part and parcel of
the Aqsa Mosque, until now and barring Muslims’ entry or exit through it is a
constant and flagrant aggression against the Aqsa Mosque! The Zionist
government’s conversion of the Tankziye School, which is part and parcel of
the Aqsa Mosque, into a camp for the occupation army until this present time, is
a flagrant and continuous aggression against the Aqsa Mosque! I reaffirm that we
are committed to knowing reality of the Aqsa Mosque and there is no excuse for
the ignorant among us!</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><b><span style="mso-bidi-font-family: Times New Roman"><font color="#0000FF">The
sand grounds planted with olive and other trees are part of&nbsp; Aqsa Mosque</font></span></b><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black"><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Whoever knows the reality of the Aqsa
Mosque will automatically know the continuous violations and aggressions against
the Mosque. I repeat that the eastern, northern and southern walls that surround
the Aqsa Mosque with their gates and buildings are part and parcel of the Aqsa
Mosque. What a tragic situation the holy Aqsa Mosque is experiencing these days
until this present moment. Then I conclude that each and every building within
the four walls are part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque! The sand grounds planted
with olive and other trees are part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque along with the
public fountains, the arches, the domes and the rest of the buildings. I repeat
that those who know these facts will know the true grief and concerns befalling
the Aqsa Mosque! One of its buildings was converted into a Zionist police
station until this moment, which is a continuous and flagrant aggression against
the Aqsa Mosque. Some of the Zionists topped by Yisrael Hokins plan to build a
temple on its sand grounds. They stated that and Hokins openly told me of the
plan. I retorted saying you are seeking a third world war because those grounds
are part of the Aqsa Mosque and your mere thinking of constructing a temple on
them was a flagrant violation of the Aqsa Mosque! The Zionist government’s
closure of gates leading to those grounds and their buildings is a flagrant and
continuous aggression against the Aqsa Mosque!<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">I then say: according to what was
previously mentioned, I affirm that the Dome of the Rock is part and parcel of
the Aqsa Mosque and the mosque built at the forefront of the area is part and
parcel of the Aqsa Mosque and not only the Aqsa Mosque as majority of Muslims
imagine until now. The building underneath this Mosque, which we call the “Old
Aqsa” is part and parcel of the Aqsa Mosque and the Marwani Mosque situated
underneath the south eastern area of the Aqsa Mosque is part and parcel of the
Aqsa Mosque. Accordingly any plot planned against the Old Aqsa or the Marwani
Mosque is a cheap and dirty conspiracy against the Aqsa Mosque. We are living in
deceptive years, a man might appear with the (deceptive) statement: “Why
don’t we give the Marwani Mosque or the Old Aqsa to the Jewish community in
the name of peace?!”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">I say wake up Muslims and Arabs, this
mere thinking is a cheap aggression on the Aqsa Mosque. Yes the wound is deep,
the night is long, the concern is heavy but the patience and sacrifices are
continuing. If we realize the previous facts, we will easily realize as Mr.
Mohammed Hassan Sharab writes in his book “Beitul Makdes and the Aqsa
Mosque”: “The Aqsa Mosque mentioned in the Surat Isra’ is all of the Haram
Al-Qudsi and the double reward for praying in it is achieved when praying in any
part surrounded by the wall.” Prayers in the Aqsa, Dome of the Rock, Marwani
Mosque or sand grounds in its yards within the Aqsa Mosque, each Raka’a equals
five hundred Raka’a (and in another narration of the Hadith equals one
thousand Raka’a) compared to other mosques on Earth with the exception of the
Grand Mosque in Makkah and the Prophet’s Mosque in Madina.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:justify"><span style="mso-bidi-font-family:
&quot;Times New Roman&quot;;color:black">Will those sleeping among us wake up
and will those inattentive among us take heed O Muslims and Arabs!<o:p>
