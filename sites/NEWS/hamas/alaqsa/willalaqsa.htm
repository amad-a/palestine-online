Jerusalem</span></u></b><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">:
After having come back from his visit to the United States on 26 February 1997,
the Israeli Premier Benyamin Netanyahu took a serious decision to build a new
settlement on Abu Ghneim hill in Jerusalem, which action was described by the
late King Hussein of Jordan as the last of its kind as told to him by the
Israeli premier. This settlement is one in a continuing series of colonies built
since the Israeli aggression began on 5 June 1967 and meant to encircle the city
in an effort on their part to Judaize Jerusalem. Through this plan, Israel seeks
to reinforce its capture of the city and isolate it from the other cities in
order to impose new geographical and demographic facts to change the cultural
and demographic features of the holy city.<o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal" style="text-align:left;direction:ltr;unicode-bidi:embed"><span style="font-size:12.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:14.0pt">The
reinforcement of these procedures in the city must not make us forget the
serious excavations under the Holy Mosque of Al-Aqsa, which came dangerously
close to collapsing, especially with the continued Israeli attempts to rebuild
their so-called third Temple (al-Haykal) on the ruins of Al-Aqsa. The following
revealed hints and implications indicating this plan should not be forgotten:<o:p>

was described in the Bible, in a colony near Haifa, was a Heavenly sign that the
rebuilding of the third Temple in Jerusalem has come nearer. Although they
consider it a miracle, they have to wait until the Cow becomes three years old,
then they will start to build their Temple.</span></p>

</span>Sheikh Ra’ed Salah, the mayor of Um Al-Fahem, revealed that a Jewish
attempt to enter Al-Marwani Mosque, located in the eastern basement of Al-Aqsa,
was stopped through a gate in the south wall of Al-Aqsa in the last week of
Ramadan.</span></p>

</span>In another escalation, the office of the premier allowed the Jews to pray
in Al-Aqsa under the pretext that this has never been prohibited. In addition,
this move was synchronized with the building of the new settlement on Abu Ghneim
and the continued excavations under Al-Aqsa, which began with the Israeli
occupation in 1967. In this context, a video prepared by Sheikh Ra’ed Salah
and Najeh Bkeirat, the chief of the Islamic Heritage Committee, showed that
several tunnels under Al-Aqsa were threatening to collapse its foundations. One
of these tunnels starts in the southwest of Al-Aqsa along with the west wall, 4
metres away, at a height of 6-9 metres and a distance of 30 metres. It ends with
small stones which have been recently built and could be removed easily.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Consequently, it will be quite easy to enter the heart of the holy
mosque. The largest tunnel lies under the so-called Single Door (al-Mefred),
while the other two tunnels lie under the Double Door. Both of them lead to the
eastern basement under Al-Aqsa. Therefore, the excavations on the western and
southern sides of Al-Aqsa and Bab Al-Rahma Cemetery have led to the following:</span></p>

</span>There were several cracks and collapses in the walls of Al-Aqsa,
especially on the south wall, which the documentary tape revealed that the Jews
were using it as a place to store their papers, including their hymns and
carols, as part of their rituals. This means that they have started using it the
same way they do the Wailing Wall (Al-Buraq), and they intend to change it into
a place for their prayers as occurred with Al-Buraq wall previously.<u><o:p>

lovers and displaying vices openly.<o:p>

book entitled, <i>The Daydreams,</i> has been recently published in Palestine in
which the writers adopted four possible scenarios concerning the future of
Al-Aqsa. The first scenario calls for the building of 10 columns representing
the Ten Commandments near the west wall of Al-Aqsa and its height would reach
the yard of the Dome of the Rock. The second theory is quite similar to the
first in that it calls for rebuilding the third Temple vertically near the west
wall of the Mosque so it will be higher than the Mosque itself and will be
connected to the internal yard of Al-Aqsa. The third adopts the notion of
architectural transfer, which suggests digging a very deep spiral path around
the Dome of the Rock which could be transferred outside the city in order to
build the third Temple on its location. Finally, the fourth theory appeals for
rebuilding the third Temple on the ruins of Al-Aqsa in general, and this theory
has a lot of future imaginary concepts. We have mentioned in an article
published in August of 1995 that there are seven various organizations preparing
for the rebuilding of the third Temple. The first one has already prepared the
geometric and architectural designs, the second has already prepared the special
stones, the third has prepared the décor and interior designs, the fourth will
prepare the special costumes to be worn in the Temple, and the fifth is
collecting funds to finance the building. Meanwhile, Sheikh Ekremeh Sabri, one
of the preachers of Al-Aqsa, mentioned in one of his orations on the second
Friday of Ramadan that a Jewish organization had warned him that Al-Aqsa would
soon be pulled down in order to build the third Temple.<o:p>

to find a path which had been the main entrance for the Temple 2,000 years ago.
The Israeli sources indicated that this ancient path was discovered accidentally
one week before during the excavations carried out by the city municipality
under Al-Buraq yard near the western and southern walls of Al-Aqsa under the
pretext of working on sewage networks.<o:p>

the municipality stopped the excavations at a depth of 4 metres and called some
experts from the archeology department whose general director Amir Dury claimed

extremist Jews received the birth of a red cow as a holy sign that the
rebuilding of the third Temple is imminent. This was confirmed by a group of
Jewish rabbis when a red cow was born six month ago in a kibbutz for the
extremists near Haifa because the cow has the characteristics of the holy cow
mentioned in the Bible. According to the Old Testament, the red cow without any
spots is essential for the purity of the Jewish rituals and so this cow will be
slaughtered and burned, then its ashes will be turned to liquid to be used in a
religious ceremony which should take place before the rebuilding of the third
Temple in the place of Al-Aqsa. The extremists claimed that no red cow has been
born since the second Temple was destroyed by the Romans, so the birth of the
red cow has been considered a miracle which will enable them to enter the holy
shrine in Jerusalem. However, they have to wait until this cow becomes three
years old, at which time they can start rebuilding the third Temple. Yahuda
Atzion, a member of the gang which attempted to blow up the Dome of the Rock in
1985, said that they had been waiting for this miracle from God for 2,000 years
but they have already been granted a red cow by God.<o:p>
