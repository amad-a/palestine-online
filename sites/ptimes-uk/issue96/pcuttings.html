    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In Dir Kadis, just across the Green Line which demarcates the pre-1967
    border many Palestinians fondly imagine will become their future border with Israel,
    Sa'ida Hadad came home from hospital after losing the five-month baby she was carrying
    when Israeli soldiers invaded her home. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The miscarriage was only one of the family's losses. Their olive trees
    were bulldozed by settlers from Kiryat Sefer, a settler town a few kilometres to the
    south. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">This is what is called &quot;creating facts on the ground&quot; and the
    settler movement, in a last frantic spasm of activity, is seizing whatever gains it can
    before Mr Barak lives up to his election promises and ends such &quot;unilateral
    actions&quot; by implementing the Wye agreement. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The mayor of Dir Kadis, Abu Mohammed, fears that his village will be
    crushed between the four settlements surrounding the 1,600 Palestinian residents. It is
    unusual for even the most extreme settlers to grab land so close to an established
    community. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The (Israeli) Civil Administration has begun marking new municipal
    boundaries for Kiryat Arba (a settlement near Hebron), including lands claimed by
    Palestinian owners that were previously declared to be beyond the settlement's municipal
    limits.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Two weeks ago, the administration evicted settlers attempting to grab
    lands for settlement, unilaterally altering the status quo on the ground on the same lands
    now included within the town's limits.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians who claim ownership of the land and their Israeli lawyer
    have denounced the administration's steps as &quot;a surrender to settlers' pressure to
    railroad the measure, in order to increase Kiryat Arba's land reserves prior to [Prime
    Minister-elect Ehud] Barak's government taking office.&quot;</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian owners, including the Sultan family and the Hebron
    Teachers Association, purchased the land in 1976, planning to build a new neighborhood on
    the property. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Shas, a ''haredi'' movement that represents mostly first- and
    second-generation immigrants from North Africa and the greater Middle East, captured 17
    seats in Israel's 120-member parliament. By picking up seven seats, Shas, a Hebrew acronym
    for Sephardic Guardians of the Torah, consolidated its place as the third-largest party in
    Israel and reached a political parity with the conservative Likud Party, which plunged to
    only 19 seats from the 32 it had before the elections.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The secular left parties also scored big victories and many secular
    voters, even those from the political right, said they voted for Barak's left-of-center
    One Israel list because they thought it would contain ultra-Orthodox influence in
    politics. So the results of the election revealed a deepening of the religious-secular
    divide.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ahmed Abu Galwis isn't celebrating the emergence of another pro-peace
    Israeli prime minister. He lost money the last time he did that.. Galwis bitterly recalls
    how he invested in land after the 1993 Oslo peace accords. So hopeful were Palestinians
    then that he was selling as soon as he bought, for cash and nice profits.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">But few Palestinians have been in a land-buying mood since the peace
    process bogged down, And to Galwis, who just sold his last parcel of land at a big loss,
    Prime Minister-elect Ehud Barak started off sounding like the man he is to replace,
    Benjamin Netanyahu.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;As we say in Arabic, `Hassan is the brother of Hussein.' They're all
    alike,&quot; Galwis said. Those sentiments are echoed again and again across the West Bank
    in the wake of Barak's landslide victory last week. Palestinians are hopeful, but Barak's
    army record, his provocative statements and disappointments under his Labor predecessors
    make people wary.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In the army, Mr Barak was dubbed the &quot;little Napoleon&quot; and was
    more used to leading commando units than delegating authority. The criticism stuck even
    when he became chief of staff.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">For the moment Israelis are giving him the benefit of the doubt. They
    voted for Mr Barak because they think he is honest and capable, in contrast to Benjamin
    Netanyahu, the defeated incumbent, who had a reputation for deceit and manipulation.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Saeb Erekat, Mr Arafat's peace negotiator, says the Palestinians have no
    illusions about Israel's new prime minister. &quot;Barak is no dove. He will be a tough
    negotiator. I am not so sure he is prepared to make the necessary compromises to make our
    state viable or secure a lasting peace.&quot;</p>
