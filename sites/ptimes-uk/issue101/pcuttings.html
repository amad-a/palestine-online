    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Government of Prime Minister Ehud Barak in Israel has made clear that
    some of the 42 illegal hilltop settlements set up on the West Bank in the waning days of
    the Netanyahu government will be removed. At the same time, the government has approved
    tenders for up to 2,600 housing units within existing settlements. Palestinians and others
    who regard unilateral settlement activity as antithetical to the peace process have
    decried the new building approvals -- not to mention the fact that most of the hilltop
    settlements will remain -- and wonder whether Mr. Barak's approach differs more in style
    than in substance from that of his predecessor.</p>

    Mandela concluded his first visit to Israel Tuesday he took pains to praise &quot;my
    friends&quot; -- Prime Minister Ehud Barak and President Ezer Weizman -- for their
    regional peacemaking efforts and the &quot;warmth&quot; of their reception. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..Yet the visit was marked by continuing undercurrents of distrust between
    Mandela, a staunch champion of the Palestinian cause, and a country that once helped arm
    the apartheid regime that Mandela drove out of power. </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip figure as one of the
    most volatile issues dividing Israel and the Palestinians as they embark on the final
    phase of negotiations aimed at reaching a definitive solution to decades of conflict. The
    Palestinians, who want to cobble the West Bank and Gaza Strip into an independent state
    within a year, demand all settlements be closed.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel captured the West Bank from Jordan in the 1967 Six-Day War. Israel
    defends its settlement policies by saying the outlying communities add to the Jewish
    state's security. And many Jews believe the land was granted to them by God and forms part
    of the biblical land of Israel.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Supporters of Benjamin Netanyahu, the former Israeli prime minister, said
    yesterday he was the victim of a political &quot;character assassination&quot; after
    police accused him of taking official gifts that should have become state property when he
    lost power.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Mr Netanyahu and his wife, Sara, were taken from their home and spent the
    day, his 50th birthday, being interrogated by fraud squad officers on why dozens of
    expensive items belonging to the state were among boxes of his possessions. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A spokesman for the Right-wing Likud Party, which Mr Netanyahu used to
    lead, said: &quot;The police maliciously invited the press and cameras in time to
    humiliate and defame a person and to pressure him before an investigation.&quot; </p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Clinton and Barak are united in their desire to make next year one of
    comprehensive peace in the region. U.S. National Security Adviser Sandy Berger spoke last
    week about the year to come until the fifth anniversary of the murder of Prime Minister
    Yitzhak Rabin, which will be marked during the week that Clinton's successor will be
    elected. Berger announced that America and Clinton have no greater priority than to
    achieve peace in the region. Indyk, a week earlier, said that the administration &quot;is
    working with Israel and Syria to prepare the ground not only for the renewal of the talks,
    but also to bring them to rapid closure. The coming year offers a very real opportunity to
    end the Israeli-Arab conflict in a comprehensive manner, once and for all.&quot;</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..the relationship between Catholics and Jews ''has never been as good''
    as it is now. ''Never has there been such a spirit of ecumenicism between Christians and
    Jews.''</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Part of the reason is the general easing of religious tensions in the
    United States since the end of World War II - between Jews and Catholics, and between
    those faiths and the Protestant denominations. Another part is the extraordinary papacies
    of John XXIII, the pontiff who convened the second Vatican Council, and John Paul II, the
    only pope who lived through the Nazi era in close proximity to the extermination camps and
    other horrors.<font SIZE="2">&nbsp;</font></p>
