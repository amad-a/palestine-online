<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Hamas: &#147;We won&#146;t attack Israeli
civilians<br>
if Israel stops attacking Palestinians&#148;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The main Palestinian opposition movement, Hamas,
has reaffirmed its principled opposition to the peace process, which won&#146;t enable the
Palestinian people to recover even the very minimum of their legitimate rights or realize
their national aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a series of interviews with Israeli and Arab media last month,
Hamas&#146; founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin reiterated his
Movement&#146;s conviction that any arrangement or settlement that might eventually result
from the Oslo process would be inherently unfair and therefore unacceptable to the vast
majority of Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Israel and the United States might succeed in imposing on the weak
Palestinian Authority a deformed arrangement which they could call peace, but soon enough
everyone would realize that this sham peace wouldn&#146;t last for a long time since it
didn&#146;t meet the basic and most elementary requisites of the Palestinian people,&#148;
Yassin told the Qatari television channel, al-Jazira.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked why Hamas has refused to join the PA in the paramount final status
talks, as the Popular and Democratic Fronts for the Liberation of Palestine ostensibly
were about to do, Yassin complained that there was no guarantee that the Palestinian
leadership would be bound by any collective Palestinian consensus on the final status
issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said Hamas would like to see all Palestinians form a united front in
the face of Israeli insolence , adding, however, that this hoped-for front ought to be
based on solid ground, apart from the restrictions of the &#147;Oslo process&#148;, which,
he said, &#147;bequeathed disunity and disintegration and turned Palestinians one against
the other.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, Yassin strongly lauded the so-called &#147;Palestinian red
lines,&#148; repeated several times of late by Palestinian Authority President Yasser
Arafat and other PA officials.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a recent interview with this correspondent, Yassin said, &#147;I urge
our brothers in the Palestinian Authority to stick to this stance.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a great thing,&#148; he said, with a broad smile, adding,
however, that &#147;our experience with Palestinian negotiators is not encouraging&#133;we
witnessed them adopt a given stance and soon afterwards back down from it under American
and Israeli pressure.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In another interview with the Israeli State-run television on 15 October,
Yassin sought to reassert Palestinians&#146; right to &#147;resist the Israeli
occupation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We can&#146;t give up the principle of resistance; this a legitimate
right guaranteed by man and God&#133;as long as there is occupation, there is resistance;
the occupation is the cause and resistance is the effect&#148;, said Yassin in his usual
extemporaneous style.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He refuted Israeli insinuations that Hamas was anti-Semitic and that the
Movement&#146;s campaign against Israel was part of its &#147;anti-Jewish ideology.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is simply untrue&#133;even if my own brother attacked me and
usurped my home and land, I&#146;ll fight him; our struggle against Jews is not because
they are Jews but because they happen to be our oppressors and tormentors.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin went so far as to propose an open-ended moratorium on attacking
Israeli and Palestinian civilians by both sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Ezzul Deen al-Qassam fighters are aware that Islam is against
targeting civilians who are non-combatants.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He suggested that attacks by Hamas&#146; military wing on Israeli
civilians were mostly a reaction to bloody Israeli attacks on Palestinian civilians,
including the murder of 29 worshipers by an Israeli settler in February of 1994.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin even reiterated an earlier proposal by the Movement&#146;s military
wing, proposing a freeze of armed attacks against Israelis, including settlers, in return
for a freeze on all settlement activity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin also denied rumours suggesting that Hamas was seeking to recruit
Israeli Arabs, saying the Movement understood the &#147;special situation of our brothers
across the Green Line.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin&#146;s statements came after the right-wing Israeli daily, <i>Ma&#146;ariv,</i>
quoted Yassin as saying that &#147;an Israeli bus will be blown up tomorrow morning.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is an outright distortion and falsification,&#148; he said,
adding, rather tersely, &#147;I didn&#146;t say what the paper said I said.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin&#146;s statements that Hamas won&#146;t target Israeli civilians
are by no means new. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even before his release from an Israeli jail in September of 1997, as part
of a deal between Jordan and Israel following the Mossad&#146;s botched assassination
attempt on Hamas politburo chief Khalid Misha&#146;al, Yassin proposed several times a
protracted truce between Israel and Palestinians in return for full Israeli withdrawal
from the West Bank and Gaza Strip, including East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, all successive Israeli governments rejected the proposal
outright, since Israel could make a much better bargain, as evident from the Oslo process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, Yassin&#146;s proposal that both sides refrain from attacking
civilians is certain to be utterly ignored by the Barak government, which is interested in
weakening Hamas and corroding its standing among Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Israel, and presumably the PA as well, is in no mood to initiate
serious contacts with Hamas on the latter&#146;s terms. Hamas, after all, is being
hounded, even de-legitimized, not only in Israel and the Palestinian self-rule areas, but
in a country like Jordan, where the Movement had enjoyed a certain sojourn for several
years. And talking to Hamas now could lead to weakening the PA and its leader Yasser
Arafat and result in redefining the peace process in ways unaccepted by Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Israel&#146;s sole approach toward Hamas is to continue to narrow
its horizons, in the hope that the Movement will be pushed toward some kind of demise. A
weak Hamas, after all, is an important pre-requisite for a successful peace process, and
vice versa. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it doesn&#146;t seem likely that narrowing Hamas&#146; horizons
will succeed in forcing the Movement into political demise in the foreseeable future.
There are two reason for that. First, the Israeli occupation of the Palestinian homeland
is Hamas&#146; ultimate <i>raison d&#146;être</i>, and this variable is not about to
radically change, let alone disappear. Second, the peace process, as it looks today, is
not likely to drastically reduce, even mitigate, Palestinian grievances and bitterness,
upon which Hamas thrives. Indeed, the opposite might be proven true. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Jordanian Monarch says there is formula <br>
to end impasse with Hamas</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amman- </b>King Abdullah II of Jordan said on 22 October he was studying
the most appropriate means to resolve the standoff between his government and the
Amman-based leaders of the Palestinian Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas..</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The official Jordanian news agency, Petra, quoted the King as saying that
he was confident Jordan and Hamas would be able to resolve outstanding differences.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The King, who was speaking on returning from an extended European tour,
that &#147;with a disciplined and objective dialogue, we will be able to find the means to
end this problem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He went on saying that the Jordanian government was studying the best
possible formula to settle the outstanding problems with Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that any settlement would have to be in the context of rule of
law, and maintaining Jordan&#146;s sovereignty and security.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas leaders have welcomed King Abdullah&#146;s statements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jamil Abu Baker, the spokesperson of the Muslim Brothers in Jordan, quoted
Hamas leaders based in Damascus as saying that &#147;Hamas doesn&#146;t mind exploring a
new formula governing their presence on Jordanian soil.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">King Abdullah II had repeated similar statements to the Jordanian
Television during his visit to Washington last month. He was quoted as saying that there
was &#147; a certain formula&#148; to end the current impasse between his government and
the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;Jordan was a country of one family; and we shall
resolve this matter, and I believe there is a certain formula in this regard and when I
return home I shall receive a report from the government on what is going on and what
should be done.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following these statements by the Jordanian Monarch, the chief of Hamas
politburo, Khalid Masha&#146;al, and the movement&#146;s official spokesman Ibrahim
Ghoshe, reportedly suspended the hunger strike they had started for five days to protest
their continued detention at a Jordanian lockup near Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Masha&#146;al reportedly said the hunger strike was &#147;a political
expression&#148; direct at the government, not the prison authorities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Musa Abu Marzuk, the former chief of Hamas politburo, insisted that Hamas
would not accept any solution of the current impasse with Jordan that didn&#146;t include
the release from jail of Masha&#146;al and Ghoshe.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He described rumors that Hamas was seeking to find a replacement for
Khalid Masha&#146;al as politburo chief of Hamas as &#147;nonsense.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile,<b> </b>thousands of Jordanians and Palestinians marched through
the streets of Wehdat refugee camp in Amman on 15 October, to protest recent Jordanian
measures against the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Taking part in the demonstration, which took place immediately after the
congregational Friday prayers, were Jordanian citizens and Palestinian refugees, signaling
that support for Hamas in Jordan is not confined to Jordanians of Palestinian origin.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the forefront of the demonstration were the leaders of the Islamic
Action Front and the Muslim Brothers, the largest and most popular Islamist political
organization in the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamza Mansour, of the Islamic Action Front, who participated in the
demonstration, said Islamists in Jordan were increasingly impatient at the Jordanian
government&#146;s failure to free detained Hamas leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He accused the Jordanian authorities of carrying out a
&#147;politically-motivated crack-down&#148; on Hamas in order to meet Israeli and
American pressure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas, he said, had every right to resist the Zionist occupation of Muslim
land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This right, he said, was guaranteed by God and man alike, and no power or
government can confiscate that most sacred right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Majid Dneibat, Head of the Muslim Brothers in Jordan, also lashed
out at the (Abdul Ra&#146;auf ) Rawabdeh&#146;s government for &#147;adopting a vindictive
approach toward Hamas in the service of Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demonstrators shouted &#147;God is Great&#148;, &#147;God is greater
than America&#148; and &#147;with soul and blood, we shall defend Hamas.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hammam Said, a former MP, lashed out at government&#146;s hostility to
Hamas.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>You are incarcerating our brothers at a time when

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><em>Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In what many Palestinians describe as a move to predetermine the shape of
the eventual final status settlement between Israel and the Palestinian Authority, the
Israeli government of Ehud Barak has been accelerating settlement expansion and land
confiscation throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to PA officials, the stepped-up pace of &#147;settlement
activities&#148; is now even faster than under the government of Benyamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Barak is carrying out Netanyahu&#146;s policies as far as
settlements are concerned, &#147; complained PA information minister, Yasser Abed Rubbo,
whom Yasser Arafat appointed to head the final status talks with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;there is no real difference between Netanyahu and
Barak&#148; and that &#147;we apparently were wrong in thinking that Barak was the dove of
peace we had all expected him to be.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sa&#146;eb Ureikat, the erstwhile Palestinian negotiator, even voiced
greater despair at the ultimate fate of the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This unprecedented onslaught of settlement expansion and land
confiscation is eroding the peace process and killing off hope for a meaningful and just
settlement of the Palestinian-Israeli conflict,&#148; said Ureikat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added, rather angrily, that &#147;Barak must choose between settlements
and peace, he can&#146;t have them both, since one is inconsistent with the other.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians powerless in face of settlement expansion</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian indignation, fraught with virtual powerlessness to stop the
settlement onslaught, was triggered by a recent and ongoing large-scale, some say
phenomenal, land seizure by the Israeli army of as many as 10,000 hectares of arable and
pasture land in the central and southern parts of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Hebron area alone, more than 3,000 hectares of pasture land were
&#147;closed off&#148; as a &#147;training field&#148; for the Israeli Defense Forces. The
Israeli army commander of the West Bank, General Illan Biran, argued that the seizure was
part of the revised Wye River agreement of Sharm el-Sheikh, adding with a whiff of snide
cynicism that the &#147;Palestinian Authority is aware of this.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, hundreds of hectares were also confiscated in recent weeks in
the Ramallah area, particularly along the former armistice line between the West Bank and
Israel proper. This suggests that Israel is planing to annex a 3-4 kilometres-wide
&#147;security zone&#148; along the former border in the contest of any final arrangement
in the West Bank. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The obvious purpose of this spate of confiscation is to enlarge nearby
Jewish settlements in the area, and presumably confront the Palestinians and the rest of
the world with an irreversible <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This imposed <i>fait accompli</i> is probably nowhere more blatant than at
the Ma&#146;ali Adumim settlement, 8 miles east of Arab-East Jerusalem, which itself has
been undergoing an unabatedly aggressive campaign of Judaization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the first week of October, the Israeli government awarded tenders for
as many as 2,600 settlement units to be constructed at Ma&#146;ali Adumim and other
neighbouring settlements, which are described by Israeli officials as &#147;final-status
red lines.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Khalil Tufakji, who heads the Cartography department at the
Arab Studies Society in East Jerusalem, the ultimate Israeli goal at Ma&#146;ali Adumim is
to achieve a &#147;Jewish demographic continuity&#148; by expanding the settlement
westward up to Jerusalem proper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the goal is to &#147;consolidate Jerusalem as
Israel&#146;s capital&#148; and to make any &#147;possible re-division of the town
impossible if thinkable.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Housing minister, Yitzhak Levy, of the pro-settler National
Religious Party (Mifdal), defended the intended expansion at Ma&#146;ali Adumim, saying
most of the planned units will be located in settlements around Jerusalem which he said
fell under &#147;national consensus,&#148; meaning they would remain under Israeli control
in a final status settlement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We joined this government on the basis of its basic guidelines, and
the basic guidelines don&#146;t mention any freezing of construction.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">H added, rather rightly, that &#147;neither the Sharm el-Sheikh nor Wye
agreements stipulated a freeze of settlement activities.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak himself seems to support this view, though quietly. His oft-repeated
remarks that the peace process should progress &#147;despite contentious issues with the
Palestinians&#148; can be construed, as many Palestinian officials do, as an allusion to
settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two agreements (at Sharm el-Sheikh and Wye Plantation) call on the two
sides to refrain from &#147;unilateral acts&#148; that undermine the peace process, a
deliberately vague clause which the Barak government says (as said Netanyahu&#146;s)
doesn&#146;t apply to settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the very decision by Barak to appoint Levy, an unhesitant advocate
of Eretz Yisrael (the Greater Biblical Land of Israel) and a fierce opponent of the Oslo
process, to the helm of the Ministry of Housing (which oversees settlement buildings in
the West Bank) suggests that Barak has no intention of reversing the settlement policies
of his predecessor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a characteristic reaction to this, the Palestinian leadership continued
to issue the usual platitudinous remarks about the &#147;illegality of the
settlements&#148; and the fact that their continued expansion &#147;endangered the peace
process&#148; and &#147;corroded confidence and trust between the two sides.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a bit more, Palestinian Leader Yasser Arafat sent letters to the
American administration, the King of Jordan, and Egyptian President Husni Mubarak, urging
them to restrain the Israeli government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, as in the past, his protest letters had virtually no effect on
Israeli bulldozers in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 11 October, the Israeli ministerial committee on settlements authorized
Barak to deal with scores of new settlement sites established after the signing of the Wye
agreement a year ago, when the then-foreign minister, Ariel Sharon, flagrantly urged the
settlers to hasten to take control of hilltops in the West Bank &#147;because whoever gets
there first will get them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 13 October, Barak met with the leaders of the settlers and reached a
&#147;gentleman&#146;s agreement&#148; with them whereby 27 of the 42 settlement sites
created after Wye would be considered &#147;legal&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, 24 hours later, Barak backed down from his earlier decision and
decided that only 12 settlements would be &#147;voluntarily&#148; removed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Settler leaders hailed the decision as a great victory since it left the
vast bulk of the settlements intact and gave them &#147;added legitimacy.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Housing Minister, who is also head of the pro-settlers Mifdal
party or (NRP), said the settlers succeeded in extracting from Barak recognition of 34
settlement sites.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;That is quite a victory,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Levy pointed out that the settlement sites slated to be dismantled, which
are not inhabited by settlers, would actually be transferred to other sites, presumably
new hilltops slated to be grabbed from Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Predictably, this classification of settlements into &#147;legal or
illegal&#148; is considered inherently unacceptable, even offensive, by the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;All settlements are illegal; this is an occupied territory, and
Barak must decide if he wants to make peace with the Palestinians or with the settlers; he
can&#146;t have the loaf and eat at the same time,&#148; said Sa&#146;eb Ureikat in an
outburst of anger on 11 October.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ureikat&#146;s comments, however, shouldn&#146;t be taken seriously, since
it is rumoured that Arafat, the sole decision maker of the PA, has quietly consented to
Barak&#146;s settlement policy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked in Tokyo, where he was attending the Donor Countries&#146;
annual conference, if he felt there was a crisis with Israel over the settlements, Arafat
said &#147;there is no crisis; every thing is going well.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Hebron fire disaster: the bigger picture</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hebron</b> - Hebron, a city accustomed to Israeli-inflicted misfortunes
for many years, was hit recently by a self-inflicted tragedy when an unchecked gas leak at
a small cigarette lighter factory on the town&#146;s northern outskirts suddenly turned
into an inferno, incinerating 15 young female workers beyond recognition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fatal incident, which took place on the ground floor of a residential
multi-storey building, apparently started when one of the lighters being transferred to
the packaging section inadvertently fell down, sparking the huge blaze. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fire raged for nearly two hours before the poorly equipped Hebron fire
fighters, joined by their counterparts from nearby Kiryat Arba&#146;a, managed to get it
under control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Inside were the charred bodies of the 15 young women huddled together in
one corner, having been overwhelmed by the huge fire and unable to escape. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to survivors, the 15 women couldn&#146;t escape because the
stall, where the factory operated clandestinely, had no emergency exits. Still more, the
outer gate of the premises was padlocked, which also prevented help from outside to get
through quickly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Added to that was the fact that local fire fighters arrived at the scene
belatedly, more than 30 minutes after the fire broke out, and even then, they
couldn&#146;t put out the fire before it was too late. Indeed, Palestinian sources
revealed that one of the fire-fighting vehicles arrived at the scene with no water and
that the hoses of the other vehicle had holes in them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat, who was lambasted for not
placing &#147;the appropriate person in the appropriate job,&#148; visited Hebron on 23
October to offer condolences to the victims&#146; families.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, who earlier hastily ordered the formation of an inquiry committee
to look into the tragedy, granted each victim&#146;s family the sum of US$ 3,000 and
promised to punish those responsible for &#147;this crime.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, very few Palestinians, indeed very few people in Hebron, even
within Arafat&#146;s Fatah movement, gave much credence to his words.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was manifested on 23 October, when hundreds of angry youths from
Hebron and the surrounding villages took to the streets shouting, &#147;Our people&#146;s
lives are not disposable&#148;, and demanding that &#147;Corrupt officials be sacked
immediately.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The demonstrators, who included supporters of Fatah as well as ordinary
citizens, hurled stones at the Municipal Council building and smashed the windscreen of
the mayor&#146;s car, triggering clashes with PA police and Mayor Mustafa Natshe&#146;s
bodyguards during which six people were injured, including a journalist. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The protests were resumed the following day, with high school and college
students from Hebron&#146;s two main universities (the Hebron University and the
Engineering College) marched through the town&#146;s main thoroughfare, shouting slogans
against &#147;corruption, unaccountability, and the absence of the rule of law.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The protesters also specifically demanded the resignation of Natshe, a
long-time Arafat supporter, and the organization of new municipal elections to enable the
people to choose their public servants. (The PA has been refusing to hold local elections
apparently out of concern for a possible victory by the Islamist opposition.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Natshe sought to defend himself against a spate of vitriolic
charges of criminal negligence, arguing that the Municipal Council didn&#146;t know about
the factory and that its proprietor, Walid Asali, had been granted a license to use the
stall for cool-storing vegetables and fruits. Moreover, Natshe accused his accusers of
&#147;using the tragedy for political reasons.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Natshe&#146;s defense didn&#146;t seem very genuine. According to
neighbours, several formal complaints about the factory and the fact that it was operating
in a residential area had been submitted to the Municipal Council, which obviously failed
to move to close down the factory.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Palestinian Authority official, Civil Defense Chief Abdul Hay Abdul
Wahid, lashed out at Natshe, accusing him of tolerating violations of safety standards in
order to levy taxes and fees from proprietors of illegal factories and workshops.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in a telling gesture, Abdul Wahid also lambasted the PA leadership for
relegating most of the money to security agencies and leaving very little funds for
services dealing with people&#146;s lives, such as his Civil Defense Department. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF"><u>Lawlessness and chaos permeating PA enclaves</u></font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Undoubtedly, the tragedy raised serious questions about safety conditions
in PA-run areas, which in turn triggered hitherto suppressed but fundamental questions
about the state of lawlessness and chaos permeating throughout the PA enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it is quite clear that the spontaneous angry reactions at the
street level following the blaze reflected a deeper and wider sense of frustration and
indignation at the many morbid phenomena afflicting the PA regime, such as Yasser
Arafat&#146;s political autocracy, the absence of the rule of law, the rampant graft,
corruption, nepotism and cronyism, as well as a widespread feeling of collective
powerlessness among many people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One newspaper commentator, Ali Jarbawi, reflected the sentiment of most
Palestinians when he wrote in his regular column in the semi-official daily <i>al-Ayyam</i>
on 23 October that the Hebron tragedy only epitomized and encapsulated a general mess
covering and overwhelming all aspects of Palestinians public life. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out the state of lawlessness, chaos and corruption, which he
said were mere symptoms of a profound political morbidity plaguing the &#147;Palestinian
experiment&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jarbawi, a former Professor of Political Science at Beir Zeit University,
said it was no secret that many of the lawbreakers in the Palestinian society were members
of the security agencies, the very people who are supposed to uphold the rule of law.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jarbawi asked in embittered and lamenting tones, &#147;Is it not strange
that many of our security cadres have actually become car thieves; is it not strange that
our security officers routinely use their power to levy commissions, protection money and
monthly stipends from the people?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He further asked, &#147;Why is no body speaking about our collapsing
justice system? And why local elections have not been organized, despite the fact that six
years passed since the establishment of the Palestinian Authority?&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF"><u>Arafat&#146;s reign of power</u></font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These daring criticisms, which get as close as possible to pointing an
accusing finger at the &#147;sacrosanct cow&#148; (Yasser Arafat), are unlikely to
convince the increasingly frail PA Chairman to change his ways. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, now entering his 70<sup>th</sup> year, never allowed any genuine
sharing of power, neither in the PLO nor in the PA. He is most certainly to remain as such
for the rest of his life, especially in light of the fact that he is solidly propped up by
Israel, the United States and most Arab regimes in the Middle East. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that the Palestinian people, especially the democratic-minded
forces in the Palestinian society, e.g. those believing in the idea of civil society and
the rule of law, should probably start preparing for the post-Arafat era. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinian Journalist Describes Harassment, <br>
Restrictions on Free Movement</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">New York-</b> The Committee to Protect Journalists (CPJ), the New
York-based independent press freedom group, is distributing the personal account of
Palestinian journalist Taher Shriteh, a veteran Gaza-based reporter for The New York
Times, the British Broadcasting Corporation, and the Japanese daily Yomiuri Shimbun, who
has been banned by Israeli authorities from traveling to Jerusalem and the West Bank. <br>
Shriteh has been denied Israeli permission to visit Jerusalem and the West Bank since
March 1995, effectively barring him from gathering news outside Gaza and from meeting with
current and prospective employers. CPJ believes that these measures have been taken in
reprisal for Shriteh's years of reporting about the activities of the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas)<br>
in Gaza.<br>
Shriteh has never been tried or convicted of any crime, and Israeli authorities have never
provided any explanation for the harsh restrictions on his movements. <br>
Last month, Shriteh learned that Israeli authorities had rejected his application for a
permit to travel via the safe-passage route between Gaza and the West Bank which
officially opened on 25 October. No reason was provided for the decision. He was also
forbidden to use the Israeli<br>
security-escorted shuttle bus service that operates between Gaza and the West Bank to
transport people barred from entering Israel.<br>
In a letter to Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak on October 21, CPJ's Executive Director
Ann K. Cooper urged the Israeli leader to &quot;ensure that current restrictions on Mr.
Shriteh's freedom of movement are lifted immediately, so that he may carry out his
professional work in Jerusalem and the West Bank without further interference from Israeli
authorities.&quot; <br>
Shriteh is one of the most accomplished and respected Palestinian journalists in the West
Bank and Gaza. For over a decade, his reporting for major international newspapers and
news agencies has earned him a reputation for uncompromising professionalism. In March
1993, he received<br>
the prestigious Freedom of the Press award from the U.S.-based National Press Club in
recognition of his contributions to press freedom and for his reporting on the Intifada
despite &quot;incarceration and harassment.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, PA civil defense authorities were forced to seek assistance

<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</p>
</b>

<p>Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has decided to allow the leader of the Democratic
Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) Nayef Hawatmeh to return the PA self-rule
areas. The decision, said an Israeli government<br>
spokesperson, was taken in light of Hawatmeh's support for the peace process and his
express inclination to take part in the final status talks between the PA and the Jewish
state. Hawatmeh, considered the most pragmatic leader of the receding Palestinian left,
made news earlier this year when he shook hands with Israeli President Ezer Weisman during
King Hussein's funeral in Amman. And ever since, he has been seeking Yaser Arafat's good
offices to convince the Israeli authorities to allow him to<br>
return to the autonomous enclaves.<br>
Predictably, Hawatmeh reacted favorably to the Israeli decision, which he termed &quot;a
correction of a historical mistake by Israel.&quot; He said he wouldn't pay any political
price for his awarded return , arguing that &quot;every expatriate Palestinian has the
right to return home, this is not an Israeli favor.&quot;<br>
Hawatmeh, whose DFLP enjoys little street popularity among Palestinians in the self-rule
areas, has been advocating the &quot;two-state solution&quot; based on United Nations
resolutions 242 and 338 and a settlement of the refugee problem based on UN resolution
194, which calls for repatriation or indemnification for those wishing not to return. <br>
Observers in Palestine suggest that the main motive behind the Israeli decision to allow
Hawatmeh to return was Israel's perpetual desire to strengthen the increasingly unpopular
regime of Yaser Arafat and build as wide-ranging a consensus among Palestinians as
possible in the run-up to the final status talks.<br>
Hawatmeh, whose ideas about the shape which the final status settlement<br>
should assume enjoy wide Palestinian support transcending factional politics, is unlikely
though to be able to exert meaningful influence on Yaser Arafat, given the latter's
authoritarian autocracy. In fact, Hawatmeh might find himself less free under
Arafat&#146;s umbrella than he was under Syrian President Hafez al Asad's. <br>
Furthermore, Hawatmeh's return would probably further isolate Hamas by illustrating its
&quot;futile rejectionism.&quot;<br>
Non the less, Hamas' &quot;futile rejectionism&quot; is likely to be vindicated, though
later rather than sooner, particularly when Israel makes it clear to Arafat and Hawatmeh
that the Palestinians have two choices, either the present autonomous enclaves, or a small
state on some 50 per cent of the West Bank, without Jerusalem, of course.<br>
On 30 September, Israel allowed the deputy-chief of the Popular Front for the Liberation
of Palestine (PFLP) Abu Ali Mustafa to return to the West Bank.<br>
The return of both Hawatmeh and Mustafa is expected to shift the &quot;power center&quot;
of Palestinian left from Damascus to the PA enclaves. </p>
