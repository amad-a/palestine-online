<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+1>DON'T PERVERT HISTORY: JIHAD IS JIHAD</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=-1> </FONT><B><FONT SIZE=+1>by Dr. Walid Phares
</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Many intellectuals and politicians within the Muslim world
often attempt to stretch the meaning of historical concepts and manipulate
them in order to cope with current political situations, or as a way to
polish their political agendas. Peace and Jihad in Islam are two of the
most popular concepts redefined by twentieth-century political writers.
In an article published by the Palestine Times (August issue) entitled &quot;A
Christian Perception of Islam, the Struggle for Dialogues and Peace,&quot;
the author tries to assure Western readers that no militant concepts are
promoted by Islamists. But by trying to reach his legitimate, political
goal, that is to brush a brighter picture of Jihad, the author falls into
the trap of distorting history and subverting centuries of implementation
by generations of Muslim leaders and activists.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	It is true that &quot;Muslims are called by the Qur&iacute;an
and the example of the Prophet of Islam to strive for Peace through all
available means,&quot; but the Peace that is called upon believers to implement
is a politico-military one, i.e., under the banner of Islam. Not that early
Muslims were different from other religious movements, including Christians
under the Crusades, but it is not fair to reinterpret what the Prophet asked
his followers to do, in light of what twentieth-century Muslim politicians
are eager to achieve. One should respect the will of Mohammed, and not try
to rephrase words which shaped the history of the region for 13 centuries.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In the same order of ideas, it is not true to say that
&quot;the very term &euml;Islam&iacute; derives from the root word whose
basic meaning is peace&icirc;,  when the opposite is true. In fact, the
terms &euml;Salaam&iacute; or even &euml;Silm&iacute; (which, by the way,
have different political meanings) come from the root verb sallama, meaning
&euml;surrender&iacute; or more precisely &euml;gave up&iacute;.  Peace,
or Salam, means the state of surrendering. Thus, al-Islam is technically
to surrender to Allah, accurately described by the author as &quot;self-surrender
to God.&quot; Also the author is right when he writes that &quot;in Qura'anic
terms, peace does not only mean absence of war, it is also a positive state
of security in which one is free from anxiety or fear.&quot;  But he fails
to explain that this state of security is only available in Dar el-Islam,
or wherever Islam prevails. That is to say that there will be full peace
and security in the conquered land.  The question is why is the land conquered
in the first place.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The author writes that &quot;Jihad is often translated
as holy war, a characterization which does not, however, fully or deeply
reflect the essence of the term.&quot; He explains that &quot;the word Jihad
comes from the verbal noun of the Arabic verb Jahada, meaning to endeavour,
to strive or to struggle.&quot; In fact while it is true that the linguistic
root of Jihad comes from Jihd (effort) or the verb Jihad (constant effort),
the debate is not about the linguistic meaning, it is about the political
meaning. For example, no one would examine the concept of crusade from a
strict linguistic angle, as it is related to the word cross; otherwise the
meaning of crusade would be &euml;act on behalf of the cross&iacute;, which
was not the reality of the movement&oacute;not the meaning still given to
it in the English language today.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The author wrote that &quot;in a religious context, it
can mean to struggle against one's evil inclination or toward the moral
uplift of society or for the spread of Islam. Islam can be spread peacefully
with the Jihad of the pen, according to Surah 16:125 of the Qur&iacute;an.&quot;
That is true, but again that is not the reason why Jihad is being debated.
Then the author finally admits the other meaning of Jihad when he wrote
&quot;but the use of force is also possible, namely with the Jihad of the
sword according to the Surah 2:193 of the Qur&iacute;an. That, in fact,
is the essence of the debate today. That fact that many verses praise Jihad
as a personal, moral struggle is not the object of inquiry, but rather that
one single verse&oacute;and there are many others&oacute;that links Jihad
to violence; this deserves the focus of analysis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The author then tries to personally interpret the concept
by writing: &quot;In my understanding, the concept of Jihad is more meaningfully
translated as &euml;holy peace&iacute;.&quot;  Here again, ethnocentrism
prevails.  If Jihad is perceived as holy peace, one should also look to
its perception by the recipients of the holy war. As for the original concept
of Peace, the instrument of Jihad has two facets. To those who implement
it, it can be what they believe it is.  To those who are facing it, it is
what it is, i.e., a violent implementation of an alien ideology and political
agenda.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The author goes on to distinguish between greater Jihad
and lesser Jihad as he writes: &quot;Among pious Muslims and mystics, it
is a spiritual and moral Jihad that is emphasized. This is called greater
Jihad in comparative terms, in relation to the lesser Jihad, the more popular
concept of Jihad, which is the &euml;Holy War&iacute;,&quot; as stated in
the following tradition (Hadith) of the Prophet Muhammed: &quot;Once, having
returned from one of his campaigns, the Prophet said: 'We have now returned
from the lesser Jihad&iacute;.&icirc;  The tradition adds that the companions
asked: &quot;What is the greater Jihad?&quot; and the Prophet answered:
&quot;The struggle against one's evil inclination.&quot;  This is the deeper
and more personal aspect of Jihad that by its very etymology is an inner
struggle for &quot;holy peace&quot;, as opposed to the outer physical struggle
for &quot;holy war&quot;. To attain real peace, one first must undergo a
real struggle that begins from within.  However, again and again, the author
forgets the level of analysis and omits it in order to compare the implementation
in various realms. In other words, what is important to non-Muslims is not
the philosophical order of Jihad within the Muslim community, but the implementation
of Jihad to non-Muslims.  If the so-called lesser Jihad means war against
the infidels, then the lesser Jihad is more important to non-Muslims than
the so-called greater Jihad, which affects only the personal lives of Muslims.
In sum, why would non-Muslims&oacute;in historical terms&oacute;attach any
importance to the personal Jihad of individual Muslims if what makes an
impact on them is the Jihad (lesser or greater) that affects their lives
and the future of their community? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The author adds that &quot;any initiative toward peace
taken by an enemy must be accepted and responded to in good faith and with
good will.&quot; He fails to explain why there is an enemy in the first
place.  Historically, Jihad was an offensive movement that moved Arab Muslims
from the Arabian Peninsula to Spain and India. To claim that mercy as a
feature of the Mujahedeen (Jihad militants) is a interesting detail, but
the question is what is the reason for Jihad?  This is the debate that all
Muslims, and probably non-Muslims as well, should be undergoing by now.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	We are curious about the mercy claimed by the Jihad advocates,
and the real challenge is for them to explain to Muslims and non-Muslims
as well why was there a Jihad at the origin of the movement? The author
concludes that &quot;the religions of Islam and Christianity teach moral
fortitude and enjoin each member to exercise justice. It is within this
commandment that Jihad or &euml;holy war&iacute; has to be understood under
the present circumstances.&quot; In other words, the author tells us that
holy war can take place in order to exercise justice. Unfortunately, the
constant missing link is whose justice are we talking about? Who decides
which it is?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In conclusion, we acknowledge the reasons why advocates
of Jihad feel uncomfortable with that concept in modern times. The balance
of power is not (yet) in favour of the Mujahedeen. But history is history,
and Jihad is Jihad, and no one can change the legacy of 13 centuries. One
cannot and must not pervert history as a way to serve political gains. Those
who invented Jihad in the 7th century intended it for particular purposes
and are the authors of the concept and as such, they should be respected
intellectually. If some of their heirs wish to change the meaning of what
was normal then, they should say so, and act upon it. In the Christian world,
modern Christians outlawed Crusading; they did not rewrite history to legitimize
themselves. Those who believe that the Jihad-Holy War is a sin today must
have the courage to delegitimize it and outlaw it as well.  </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Editor's note</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>: The said article
was a Christian perception of Islam. The articles published in this newspaper
do not necessarily reflect the views of the Palestine Times. However, we
agree with Dr. Phares on many points mentioned in his article.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A letter from Mr.</FONT><FONT SIZE=-1>
</FONT><FONT SIZE=+1>John Hartung</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A.M. Rosenthal complains that &quot;the Palestinian Charter
vowing the destruction of Israel&quot; has not been rewritten (&igrave;Spitting
on the Graves&icirc;, 1 August 1997, New York Times).  Perhaps the Palestinians
would be more encouraged to rescind that clause and surrounding nations
would encourage them to do so if Judaism and Christianity renounced Deuteronomy
20:10-18 (Revised Standard Version of the Bible):</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;When you draw near to a city to fight against it,
offer terms of peace to it. And if its answer to you is peace and it opens
to you, then all the people who are found in it shall do forced labour for
you and shall serve you. But if it makes no peace with you, but makes war
against you, then you shall besiege it; and when the LORD your God gives
it into your hand you shall put all its males to the sword, but the women
and the little ones, the cattle, and everything else in the city, all its
spoils, you shall take as booty for yourselves; and you shall enjoy the
spoils of your enemies, which the LORD your God has given you. Thus you
shall do to all the cities which are very far from you, which are not cities
of the nations here.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;But in the cities of these peoples that the LORD
your God gives you for an inheritance, you shall save alive nothing that
breathes.&quot;</FONT></P>
