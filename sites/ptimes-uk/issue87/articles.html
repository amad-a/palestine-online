<H3><CENTER>In Remembrance Of Sabra And Shatila<BR>
A review of Israeli terrorism against the Palestinian refugees</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By  Dr. Daud Abdullah*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>To the Palestinians and Israelis alike, the month of September has two
very distinct and opposite significances in their national histories.  Each
year, it brings to the Palestinians painful memories of human savagery and
barbarity. Hence, in their tragic narrative, September is often remembered
as the season of brutal repression and suffering-the month of Sabra and
Shatila.<BR>
On the other side of the divide, in Israel, September is associated with
more fortunate and rewarding memories.  It is the month of the Camp David
accords, which secured for Israel peace with Egypt, the regional power with
which it had, prior to 1978, fought four destructive wars.  Similarly, September
is also the month of the bizarre handshake on the White House lawn that
formalized the Palestinian Liberation Organization's (PLO) recognition of
Israel's right &quot;to exist in peace and security.&quot;  Needless to
say that there was no corresponding recognition by the other contracting
parties of any Palestinian right to a State.  <BR>
With reference to Sabra and Shatila, the recent decision by over 100 countries
to establish an international criminal court to try war crimes has led to
an immediate renewal of calls for the trial of those Israelis responsible
for the September 1982 massacres of Palestinian refugees.  If current political
trends are anything to go by, the Palestinian demand for justice can never
rightly be dismissed on the basis that the massacres were carried out 16
years ago.  For in this context, one need only recall that during the State
visit of Syria's President Assad to France in July 1998, his counterpart,
Jacques Chirac, was forced by Jewish groups to raise the issue of Nazi war
criminal, Alois Brunner.  Syria, they allege, has been sheltering the fugitive,
who is suspected of crimes committed in the main French concentration camp
at Drancy between 1943 and 1945. That being the case, it would surely be
a travesty of justice and a breach of Western democratic traditions if one
group of war criminals are hounded and brought to book while others are
allowed to go scot-free.</P>

<P>An established pattern of warfare<BR>
For the sake of argument, one may claim that there were no gas chambers
in Sabra and Shatila, so, let sleeping dogs lie. Yet the international Commission
that investigated Israeli violations of international law during its invasion
of Lebanon had different views on the matter. The majority of its members
concluded that the massacres which took place at Sabra and Shatila in September
1982 were genocidal massacres, and the term 'complicity in genocide' is
wide enough to establish the responsibility of Israel for these acts.1 
Unlike crimes of State such as wars of aggression where only the State is
liable, war crimes and crimes against peace and humanity incur individual
responsibility.  Hence, the independent Commission recommended the prosecution
of those Israeli political and military leaders found responsible or involved
in the planning and execution of the massacres.  <BR>
Although 6 million Palestinians were not gassed in the camps, the fact that
an estimated 3,000-3,500 were slaughtered between 16-18 September 1982 was
in itself quite horrendous to say the least. A British medical doctor working
in Beirut at the time graphically described the carnage when she wrote:
&quot;Besides being shot dead, people were tortured before being killed.
They were beaten brutally, electric wires were tied round limbs, eyes were
dug out, women were raped (often more than once), and children were dynamited
alive.&quot; <BR>
With so many Palestinian skeletons in its cupboards, Israel, it seems, had
no other option than to oppose the 1998 establishment of the UN-sponsored
international court to try war crimes.  Had the events at Sabra and Shatila
been an isolated chapter in their conflict with the Palestinians, things,
perhaps, would have been different.  If nothing else, fewer officials would
be implicated.  But the mere fact that the events which took place in the
camps in 1982 were only a single episode in a long-running campaign of genocidal
warfare means that any comprehensive investigation should include other
horrific massacres like that of Deir Yassin (1948) and Qibua (1953).  In
the latter instance, Ariel Sharon, Israel's present Minister of Infrastructure,
led an attack by a special forces battalion (Unit 101) against the West
Bank village of Qibua in which 66 men, women and children were killed. 
Subsequently, in the immediate years prior to the massacres at Sabra and
Shatila, the Israelis executed other devastating attacks against the Palestinian
refugee camps in Lebanon in 1978, 1980 and 1981. In 1982 itself, Lebanese
hospital and police records confirmed that 17,835 people were killed by
Israeli bombings between 4 June and the end of August. Of course this figure
did not include bodies not found or buried in mass graves.  This established
pattern of mass terror against Palestinian civilians, continued until September
when the same Ariel Sharon, then-Minister of Defence, and his Chief of Staff,
Rafael Eitan, decided to send Israeli troops into the West Beirut camps
of Sabra and Shatila.  <BR>
Given the fact that systematic physical extermination is not the only criterion
of genocide, the case against Israel appears even more condemnatory.  Legal
experts maintain that within the context of their struggle for national
liberation, the specific form of genocide conducted against the Palestinians
included all the policies designed to destroy their identity, national culture
and political will.  Indeed, the United Nations Genocide Conventions, which
were adopted by the General Assembly in 1948 and ratified by Israel, defines
genocide in Article II as the enumerated acts committed with intent to destroy,
in whole or in part, a national, ethnic, racial or religious group. Thus,
Israel's systematic destruction of Palestinian refugee schools, training
centres, museums and hospitals in Lebanon all fall within this category.
 Again, the same principle applies to the Israeli destruction of the Centre
for Palestinian Studies in Beirut in 1982 and removal of its archives. 
Likewise, the transfer to Israel of documents, records, artifacts and books
pertaining to the Palestinian people was also in clear breach of the 1954
Hague Convention for the Protection of Cultural Property in the Event of
Armed Conflict. </P>

<P><B>Honouring the martyrs</B><BR>
Although the massacres at Sabra and Shatila will always be remembered as
one of the worst atrocities of modern times, it must not be forgotten that
several other refugee camps suffered similar incalculable losses.  Rashidiyeh,
Ain el Hilweh, Bourj al Brajneh, Bourj al Shemeli and el Buss were all heavily
bombarded by the Israelis.  That the perpetrators of these crimes were not
brought to justice was not, however, due to lack of evidence or the absence
of appropriate legal mechanisms.  Clearly there are the Nuremberg principles
which affirm that war crimes and crimes against humanity are committed against
the world community and not just the victims of the crimes and therefore,
the world community has the right to prosecute and punish, regardless of
the victims' identities.  Furthermore, was it not the American prosecutor
at Nuremberg, Robert Jackson, who promised that the same laws which were
used to punish German and Japanese war criminals will in future be used
against other nations who commit similar crimes?  And, were it not the very
laws which enabled Israel to kidnap and execute Adolf Eichmann in 1962 after
the allied powers failed to bring him before the Nuremberg Tribunal? That
being the case, will the international community ever sanction similar action
by the Palestinians against those who committed war crimes against them
in Lebanon and elsewhere? <BR>
The truth of the matter is, when it comes to Palestinian rights everything
must take precedence. The refugees' rights to repatriation, property restoration
and compensation can be put on ice for 50 years and this is perfectly normal,
as long as the peace process continues, the presidential elections take
place, and the Knesset goes on summer recess.  Back in the squalid camps,
however, the survivors of Sabra and Shatila must wait yet another 16 years
before justice is done.  Meanwhile, the grinding wheels of poverty, deprivation
and marginalization must continue to turn.  For in Lebanon today more than
half of the Palestinian youth between the ages of 15 and 22 are out of school.
 Instead of completing their secondary and university education they are
forced to enter the job markets or indeed join the teeming ranks of the
unemployed.  Imprisoned as they are in a world of indescribable poverty
there is now a 22% drop-out rate among primary and secondary school students
either because they could not afford the cost of education or because they
are obliged to work and help their destitute families.<BR>
Following the total annihilation of their camp in 1982, the survivors from
the Sabra refugee camp were forced to seek shelter and rebuild their broken
lives anywhere else except Palestine. They remain today an integral part
of the 352,668 dispossessed Palestinians currently marooned in Lebanon.
Having apparently exhausted all its sources of immigrants, the Jewish State,
which was originally intended to be &quot;a national home for the Jewish
people&quot; in Palestine, is now reviewing its laws to grant Israeli citizenship
to the non-Jewish relatives of its soldiers, many of whom are, ironically,
serving in southern Lebanon. Since the early 1990s, Israel has received
over 800,000 immigrants from the former Soviet Union making up 16% of the
country's population.  Of this number, it is estimated that 30% of them
were non-Jews!  Even in the light of these developments, the brokers of
peace maintain that the Palestinian refugee issue must remain shelved because
it is difficult to expedite their return and social and economic rehabilitation
as recommended in UN resolution 194 of 1948.<BR>
Despite the solemn pledge proclaimed in its Charter &quot;to save succeeding
generations from the scourge of war ... and reaffirm faith in the fundamental
human rights, in the dignity and worth of the human person&quot;, the United
Nations has consistently failed to protect the Palestinian refugees or assist
in their return.  Indeed, the world has silently witnessed the forced deportation
of thousands of Palestinians from the West Bank, Gaza Strip and Jerusalem
after these territories were occupied in 1967, albeit contrary to international
law.  Article 6 of the Nuremberg Tribunal explicitly cites the deportation
of civilians of occupied territories as a war crime and a crime against
humanity. To mark the sixteenth remembrance of the massacres at Sabra and
Shatila, the least the UN can therefore offer the Palestinian people is
to carry out its legal obligations and prosecute those Israeli political
and military leaders implicated in those dreadful events between 16 and
18 September.  Although this long-overdue initiative may never heal the
painful wounds, it may, nevertheless, restore some credibility to the world
body which has become proverbially incapable of enforcing its will, even
in the defence of justice.  <BR>
On their part, one of the main tasks before the Palestinian leadership,
official and unofficial, is to intensify their educational programmes among
the refugees; the rapid slide into illiteracy and inertia must be arrested;
the study of the history of Palestine should be made compulsory, even in
vocational schools and technical institutes; the desire and aim to return
to Palestine must be nurtured and encouraged in every refugee and exile
community; and the various international schemes to resettle them in foreign
lands must be exposed and resisted at every turn.  In a word, there would
be no better way to honour the martyrs of Sabra and Shatila than to ensure
the defeat of the colonialist project in occupied Palestine. </P>

<H3><CENTER>PA spreads moral decadence in the territories</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Khalid Amayreh</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>Nablus (10 August)</B>  In addition to its conventional means of fighting
the Islamist opposition influence, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority
(PA) has embarked on &quot;a campaign of social change,&quot; aimed at &quot;delivering
the population from the shackles of Islamic influence.&quot;<BR>
According to reliable sources within the PA, the idea behind the campaign,
which is reportedly tacitly encouraged by Israel and the CIA, is based on
the premise that by exposing young Palestinians to the more liberal Western
lifestyles, the youth would gradually shun Islam's rigid moral and behavioural
codes adopted by Hamas, the main political and ideological opposition to
Yasser Arafat' secular, but manifestly corrupt, rule.<BR>
Among the new seductions being sought after and introduced are the following:
encouraging mixed parties and concerts during which alcoholic beverages
are served, opening pubs and night clubs in major Palestinian towns, sending
Palestinian youngsters to summer camps in Israel and Western countries,
and even opening a lavish casino in Jericho, described by some as the largest
in the Middle East. <BR>
The &quot;liberalization blitz,&quot; as labeled by some PA officials, has
offended Islamic sensibilities, provoking angry reactions from Islamist
as well as Fatah leaders. Last week, several Legislative Council members
openly castigated Arafat's authority for &quot;seeking to destroy our moral
values in the service of Zionism.&quot;<BR>
Husam Khader, a maverick councilor known for his scathing criticisms of
Arafat's nepotistic rule, charged that &quot;certain centres of power within
the PA are spreading promiscuity and moral decadence among Palestinian youth.&quot;<BR>
Khader cited several examples, including the recent licensing by Nablus-appointed
mayor Ghassan al Shaka'a of several pubs throughout the town, despite widespread
opposition from townspeople and local civic and religious leaders. <BR>
A Palestinian policeman intimated that the pubs, which serve all kinds of
liquor from homemade Arak to strong Russian Vodka, are frequented mostly
by &quot;alaedun&quot; or the returnees, e.g. Arafat supporters who were
allowed to return to the West Bank from such places as Tunis, Lebanon, Iraq
and Algeria. <BR>
However, the police added that &quot;a growing number of locals are beginning
to show up especially on weekends.&quot;  Occasionally, intimated one policeman,
a belly dancer, or even more, a prostitute disguised as a songstress, is
&quot;hosted,&quot; causing the number of customers to swell.<BR>
As expected, the abomination rings an alarm bell for local Islamist leaders
such as Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi, who is considered the most senior Islamist
leader after Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin.<BR>
Expressing horror at &quot;the onslaught of moral looseness&quot; throughout
Nablus, Beitawi pointed out that the &quot;moral corruption&quot; that found
its way to our streets since the establishment of the PA four years ago,
exceeded by many folds that which the Israeli occupation sought to spread
during 27 years of direct Israeli occupation.<BR>
Beitawi, and others not necessarily associated with the Islamic movement,
complained that the local PA Government was &quot;giving a brazen green
light for all sorts of wanton and promiscuous activities while deliberately
impeding Islamist-sponsored activities.&quot;<BR>
He cited one example at the Najah National University where the college
administration, ostensibly heavily influenced by the PA and its various
security agencies, refused to okay an Islamist event on campus.<BR>
On 30 July, the local municipal council invited the Israeli songstress Zahava
Ben to sing at al Batahan tourist resort 10 kilometres southwest of Nablus.
The concert was attended by 2,000 people, including a number of VIPs from
the PA, including mayor Ghassan al Shaka'a, who is also a member of the
PLO Executive Committee, and the Mahmoud Al Alul, the governor of Nablus.
 Ms. Ben sang until after midnight, mimicking famous Arab singers like Um
Kulthum, Farid al Atrash and Abdul Halim Hafez. Mesmerized by Ben's melody,
the attendants, who included men and women from all ages, drank and danced
till after midnight.<BR>
The performance of Zahava Ben in Nablus infuriated opposition as well Fatah
leaders in Nablus and the rest of the West Bank.  Former Nablus mayor Bassam
al Shaka'a, the current mayor's cousin, complained that it was &quot;obscene
and scandalous for Yasser Arafat to implore Arab leaders at Casablanca to
terminate all forms of normalization with Israel at a time when PA and PLO
executives are having convivial parties with the Zionists in Nablus.&quot;<BR>
Popular discontent goes beyond pups and convivial parities. Nablusites,
say many, are worried that the PA would indulge in the ultimate &quot;vice&quot;,
the licensing of &quot;prostitution houses.&quot; <BR>
Last month, the Preventive Security Force, headed by Colonel Jibril Rajoub,
reportedly arrested a prominent capitalist and businessman from the Abdul
Hadi clan along with his son. Reasons for the arrests varied, according
to the people asked, from &quot;tax evasion to involvement in procuring
prostitutes.&quot;<BR>
One PSF agent intimated that the businessman apparently had a certain connection
with a group of women beggars who reportedly begged in the streets of Nablus
during the daytime while practicing the &quot;oldest profession&quot; at
night.<BR>
Soon after Abdul Hadi was detained, his influential friends moved to get
him released, among them the mayor, Ghassan al Shaka'a, who reportedly interceded
with Yasser Arafat for his friends. Twenty-four hours after his arrest,
the prominent businessman was ordered released by Arafat.</P>

<P><B>Casino in Jericho</B><BR>
Meanwhile, Arafat's economic advisor, Muhammed Rashid is putting the final
touches on &quot;Casino al Waha,&quot; meaning &quot;oasis&quot;, in Jericho,
with a total cost ranging between $150 million and $200 million dollars.
The gambling centre (some say will be the largest in the Middle East) was
established on a plot of land belonging to the Islamic Wakf, a stark irony
since Islam considers gambling a great vice.<BR>
&quot;Where in the world--a den of vice is established on Islamic Wakf land&quot;,
protested Sheikh Harb Jaber, a local influential imam in Jericho.<BR>
Like many other citizens in Jericho, Jaber is indignant at the PA for treating
with utter disregard the sensitivities of the local population. He lashes
out at the entire PA establishment with &quot;they are trying to destroy
our values ... these people are corrupt to infinite proportions ... they
worship money, and for the sake of money they are willing to cross all red
lines...&quot;<BR>
Never the less, such an outcry usually falls on deaf ears, to put it mildly,
if only PA officials, both on the local and national levels, are accountable
not to the people, but only to Yasser Arafat, who appointed them to their
posts. (Arafat canceled all municipal elections until further notice because
of plummeting popularity.)<BR>
Last month, Muhammed Rashid, the powerful Arafat-man behind the casino,
threatened to &quot;crush any person or persons seeking to undermine this
economic edifice.&quot;<BR>
He lambasted &quot;the forces of darkness&quot; (alluding to his Islamist
critics) for &quot;raising questions and suspicions about anything we do.&quot;<BR>
Seeking to justify his evil deed, Rashid argued during a live interview
with a Gulf satellite television programme host last June that &quot;all
our life is haram (Islamically unacceptable)--our people work on building
Jewish settlements, we trade with the Israelis--so why the attack on the
casino?&quot;<BR>
Rashid, who oversees Arafat's secret bank accounts in Tel Aviv, claimed
the casino will create as many as 400 jobs, a claim that is disputed by
serious experts. <BR>
The casino is slated to open this winter, even though it has not received
proper licensing from relevant PA ministries, namely the local government,
tourism and the interior ministries. <BR>
Interestingly, while PA actions are met with strong opposition by most Palestinians,
the Israeli Government and intelligence services are lauding the &quot;progressive
social culture&quot; adopted by the PA.<BR>
Recently, a former senior Israeli military official in the West Bank praised
Yasser Arafat's &quot;liberalization campaign&quot;.<BR>
&quot;The openness being carried out by the PA is probably the greatest
achievement in combating Islamic fanaticism and extremism in 30 years&quot;,
said Shmuel Goren, the former coordinator of the Israeli occupation activities
in the West Bank.<BR>
Goren added, rather slyly, that &quot;we should support these positive developments
on the part of the PA, because it works in our favour since Islamic fundamentalism
is our common enemy.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>50 Years Of Dispossession: Prospects For The Future</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ghada Khouri*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>As they reflected on the lessons of the past 50 years, prominent leaders
representing Palestinians from the Occupied Territories, the diaspora, and
Israel proper called for the official burial of an ailing peace process
and the launching of a new initiative based on justice, international law
and the right to self-determination. <BR>
Addressing the 15th National Convention of the American-Arab Anti-Discrimination
Committee (ADC) on  13June, Haider Abdel Shafi, a founding member of the
Palestine Liberation Organization (PLO) and Chairman of the Palestine Red
Crescent Society in Gaza, described the current state of Palestinian affairs
as &quot;sad and terrible&quot;. Putting the present into historical perspective,
he blamed the loss of Palestine on Arab disunity as much as on British deception
and Zionist schemes. The Arabs' lack of coordination in the face of a common
threat proved fatal and contributed to Al-Nakba (the Catastrophe) of 1948,
he said. <BR>
Despite the abominable failures of Arab leaders throughout the past 50 years,
Abdel-Shafi praised &quot;Palestinian tenacity&quot;, which allowed the
Palestinian people to withstand adversity and maintain their identity.<BR>
Today, the Palestinians find themselves in a quagmire created by their leaders.
To Abdel Shafi, the only way to get out of it is to condition any resumption
of peace negotiations on an Israeli commitment to stop settlement activity,
coupled with an official recognition of the Palestinian right to self-determination
and the refugees' right of return. <BR>
The basis of any genuine peace process is contingent upon a mutual agreement
on such basic principles, according to Azmi Bishara, a member of the Israeli
Knesset and a leading advocate of Palestinian rights. He bitterly criticized
the Palestinian leadership for embracing the Oslo process, which he described
as the only negotiations in modern history in which an oppressed party &quot;made
peace with a colonizer and then started negotiating.&quot; Had they followed
this approach, &quot;not one person in the Third World would have achieved
self-determination,&quot; he added.<BR>
The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations, which have yet to bear the fruits
of a stable and genuine peace, are hostage to the asymmetry of power between
the two parties and to Israel's refusal to accept the legitimacy of the
Palestinians' right to statehood. Hence, the Oslo process has produced nothing
more than the &quot;infrastructure of a future apartheid regime,&quot; in
Bishara's words. <BR>
Crucial issues that lie at the heart of the Arab-Israeli conflict, such
as the refugee problem, were left for final status talks while Israel continues
to change facts on the ground, thus preempting the outcome of such negotiations.
As a result, most Palestinian refugees have rejected the Oslo process, a
deal which left them feeling betrayed, according to Shafiq Al Hout, a founding
member of the PLO and former PLO Representative in Lebanon. Five years after
the signing of Oslo &quot;is more than enough to find out it was a mistake,&quot;
Al Hout said. &quot;We must stop this comedy and find other means to resume
our negotiations on a different basis.&quot;<BR>
Fifty years since the forced exile of  800,000 Palestinians from their homes,
Zionist falsehoods are increasingly being questioned. While Zionist apologists
for Israel continue to propagate the myth that Palestinians left of their
own free will, more and more Israeli and Western historians have begun recognizing
the fact that they were driven out by force, Al Hout asserted. <BR>
Approximately 85% of the 1948refugees came from what is today Israel proper
and an additional of  800,000 Palestinians were displaced in the 1967 war.
Today, the total Palestinian population amounts to 7 million people scattered
around the world. Al Hout reminded the audience that behind the statistics
and the numbers lie individual stories of human beings with dreams, aspirations
and inalienable rights.  <BR>
UN General Assembly resolution 194, which has been rejected by Israel, stipulates
that &quot;the refugees wishing to return to their homes and live at peace
with their neighbours should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable
date while &quot;compensation should be paid for the property of those choosing
not to return.&quot; However, Al Hout called on the Palestinians to face
the fact that those in the diaspora &quot;are going to stay there&quot;
because Zionism presupposes the establishment of a &quot;pure Jewish State&quot;
and cannot, by definition, accept their return. Seeking compensation for
their losses should therefore be the main driving force of the refugees'
quest for a solution to their plight.<BR>
Fifty years after Al-Nakba, exposing the moral, theoretical and historical
flaws of Zionism is crucial at this crossroads in Palestinian history, according
to Bishara. He emphasized the importance of commemorating the &quot;Catastrophe&quot;
in order to debunk Zionist myths by telling the world about the Palestinian
experience. &quot;No Israeli-or American for that matter-would understand
why a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza is a compromise if he
doesn't understand that the tragedy began in 1948,&quot; he asserted.<BR>
Bishara's vision of a lasting Palestinian-Israeli peace is that of a bi-national
State with Palestinians and Israelis living together as citizens with equal
rights. He admitted that this notion is only an &quot;idea,&quot; rather
than &quot;a political programme.&quot; At the same time, he called for
the creation of a Palestinian &quot;third party&quot; that would adopt a
&quot;democratic programme for the future&quot; and would include both Palestinians
from the Occupied Territories and from the diaspora.<BR>
The three leaders concurred that the establishment of democracy in the embryonic
Palestinian State is a prerequisite to a stable and just peace. To Abdel
Shafi, such a movement should be launched by Arab intellectuals committed
to building a democratic society that would not only protect the interests
of the Palestinians, but also elicit respect for their cause around the
world. To Al Hout, it is the Palestinian masses that are a source of hope
for a brighter future as they &quot;have always been much more creative,
patriotic and sincere than all the leaders we have witnessed in the history
of Palestine.&quot;<BR>
The panel provided a microcosm of what today constitutes Palestinian society-an
amalgamation of past memories, current facts, and future hopes shared by
Palestinians living under occupation, in exile, or as citizens of the very
entity which caused their dispossession. Despite being worlds apart, the
speakers were united in their belief that the struggle for justice goes
on within the hearts and minds of the Palestinian people, even while their
leaders fail to advance their best interests. <BR>

<H3><CENTER>History Repeats Itself</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ramzy Baroud</B></CENTER></P>

<P><BR>
As if no lessons were learned from the past 50 years, Arab politicians and
media are still making the same deadly mistake.  If someone asks: &quot;Whom
should we blame for the collapse of the Peace Process?&quot; every Arab
newspaper will answer confidently and with no hesitation: &quot;Netanyahu&quot;.
Perhaps no one will even point out that Netanyahu is nothing but the symbol
of the general Israeli attitude. It is the attitude, reflected in the Israeli
public and their political representation, which states, &quot;Gain much,
and give little&quot;. <BR>
In the Arab world, we are used to putting the blame on an individual. This
perspective may be a result of the nature of our political environment in
the Middle East. Our political systems are usually a &quot;one-man show&quot;.
 Israel, though, is different, and we must understand that.  Netanyahu was
elected after a loud and clear campaign. It was a campaign that promised
not to honour any agreed-upon accords. His campaign also made this clear:
No more land for Arabs. The majority of the Israeli people voted for Netanyahu
because they accepted and acknowledged these principals. <BR>
The survival of Netanyahu's government, despite its shaky structure, is
a reminder that the majority of the Israeli Government still holds on to
its campaign promises. Netanyahu obviously represents the status quo of
Israeli public opinion.<BR>
Here in the U.S., the man is viewed as the strong Jew who does not compromise
when it comes to the &quot;sacred Jewish land&quot; or the &quot;holy Jewish
blood&quot;.  In Netanyahu's last visit to the U.S., Israel's American lobby,
AIPAC, sent a bold and frighteningly clear message to Bill Clinton through
his own colleagues, the American Senate.  Of the 100 U.S. senators, 81 signed
a letter cautioning Clinton and his administration against imposing any
&quot;unnecessary pressure&quot; on the Israeli Prime Minister. It simply
shows that the Israeli lobby in the U.S. has 81% influence over the strongest
governmental entity, the Senate. Only 19% of this entity support their own
president.<BR>
While the larger chunk of the Israeli people and their representatives (as
well as the American Jews and their lobbies) take the same strong stand
that Netanyahu takes, the Arab media still target their blame on one man.
<BR>
Who is being deceived here, the Arab media, the Arab people, or both? A
quick look back into history will help us find that the same mistake has
been committed many times. In virtually every Israeli election, Arabs and
Palestinians alike have paid close attention to the race between the &quot;doves&quot;
and the &quot;hawks&quot;. Assuming that real and significant differences
exist between them, Arab media celebrated the victory of the &quot;doves&quot;
with hope and expectation and wept when the &quot;hawks&quot; emerged as
victors.  Then everyone waited for the great new Government to make a difference.
 The difference was never made. <BR>
When the &quot;virtuous Israeli peacemaker&quot; Rabin was killed, Arabs
mourned as if the man was the defender of the Palestinian cause throughout
the years. One handshake on the White House lawn, in addition to some insignificant
acts of redeployment in the Occupied Territories, was enough to reverse
history.  One handshake was enough to obliterate Rabin's many years as a
war criminal. One handshake was enough to make us pretend that no &quot;broken
bones&quot; or &quot;iron fist&quot; policies ever existed.  And when the
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres lost the latest elections, many
hearts throughout the Arab world were broken. <BR>
Do we dare to ask: &quot;Isn't he the same Peres who ordered the brutal
killing of 125 Palestinian women and children in the UN shelter in South
Lebanon? Isn't he the same Peres who proudly bragged about the killing of
Yahya Ayyash (the Engineer) inside the Palestinian Authority zone? Maybe
we dare to ask, but will we dare to remember? <BR>
The concept of the good Israeli leader and the bad one is a myth. It is
a myth that someone created, and the Arab public opinion fell into the trap
of believing it.  From the time of David Ben-Gurion through Golda Meir,
with her popular statement &quot;Palestinians don't exist&quot;, to Netanyahu
and his arrogant denial of all internationally agreed upon principals, the
leaders of Israel have always proved that the only thing to choose between
them is this: who is the lesser of the evils?<BR>
If Rabin was believed to be the courageous one, why did he insist on the
reunification of occupied Jerusalem, turning his back on the clear UN resolutions
regarding that matter? If Peres also was the angel of peace, why did he
refuse to redeploy troops from the city of Hebron shortly before the elections
(as he was expected to), causing great turmoil in the peace process once
Netanyahu became Prime Minister? Benyamin Netanyahu is a link in a giant
complicated network consisting of a large segment of the Israeli population,
the Israeli Government (and its influence worldwide), and, most importantly,
the Israeli mentality, which refuses to accept the sole meaning of peace.
 Peace, for them doesn't necessarily mean equal expectations or equal concessions
from both sides. As long as they hold on to that belief, and they will,
many &quot;Netanyahus&quot; are coming soon to television screens near you.
<BR>
The Prophet Mohammed once said: &quot;The Faithful One cannot be bitten
by the same snake twice&quot;. The Arabs have been bitten by the same snake
countless times over the past 50 years. So... aren't we the same faithful
people who we once were? Or is that snake so shrewd that it deceives us
by changing it's skin over and over again?</P>

<H3><CENTER>Hunting Down Imad Awadallah: A New PA Charade</CENTER></H3>

<P><BR>
<B>By PT staff</B><BR>
&quot;We hold the Palestinian Authority (PA) fully responsible for Awadallah's
safety, who had been arrested for several months without any solid evidence&quot;,
said a communique from the Islamic movement Hamas, commenting on the PA's
announcement that Imad Awadallah had escaped from the Jericho jail. They
have good reason to believe that the whole thing is no more than a charade
to get rid of the Hamas activist, just like they did with Mohyyideen Al
Sharif earlier this year.  <BR>
Since the assassination of Al Sharif (the successor of Hamas's late &quot;Engineer&quot;
Yahya Ayyash) and the fabricated story of the PA by which it accused the
Hamas leadership of killing its own members, Imad Awadallah had to be on
the run since the PA, after pinpointing him as the main suspect in the assassination,
set out on a manhunt to arrest him-proving, beyond any doubt, that the PA
was playing the role of &quot;Israeli cop&quot; in the occupied territories,
thus taking part in clamping down on the Islamic movement in an even more
crude manner than the Israelis had.  Not only did its fabricated story clear
Israel from any direct or indirect responsibility, but it also justified
the arrest of Imad Awadallah.<BR>
Since his arrest, Awadallah endured extreme torture, not only to force him
to confess to a crime he didn't commit, a well-known fact by his interrogators,
but most importantly to elicit information regarding the Hamas organizational
structure and its leaders' whereabouts. He was transferred from one prison
to another; deprived of food, water and sleep for lengthy periods of time;
and left for days or even weeks with both hands and legs cuffed or hanging
by his arms at the cell windows after being beaten harshly all over his
body. During the period of his imprisonment, he lost more than 20 kilograms,
was denied family visits and was held in solitary confinement (even the
Palestinian Legislative Council members were unable to see him). In protest
to this grave injustice, Awadallah went on a hunger strike, which eventually
resulted in granting his family permission to visit him, where they were
in for a big shock owing to his weight loss.  &quot;He had become so small
I could lock both my arms around him&quot;, said Ala'a Awadallah's daughter.
 On the other hand, his family was outraged over his severe deteriorating
health condition and ill treatment.  Awadallah's mother said she was worried
that the PA was planning to kill her 29-year-old son, and feared that the
authorities may have even allowed his escape so as to justify killing him
later on.  However, Hamas considered &quot;the disappearance of Awadallah
to have raised many doubts over the real intentions of the authorities,
especially since the intelligence forces had failed to elicit information
about his brother's (Adel Awadallah's) whereabouts, plus failing to convince
him into confessing to the assassination of Al Sharif in trade for his release.&quot;
In addition, the movement warned that &quot;the claims of Awadallah's disappearance
may be an excuse to target him&quot; and requested the &quot;disclosure
of his detention whereabouts as well as the release of all political detainees.&quot;<BR>
Are the concerns by Awadallah's family and movement justified, or merely
groundless doubts? Drawing from lessons learned in the Al Sharif incident,
their doubts and fears seem completely justified since the PA, in spite
of its skipping peace talks, is desperate to prove its good intentions to
the U.S. and the Israeli Government in order to enhance progress in the
negotiations, thus securing the withdrawal from the territories, even if
it had to do so at the expense of its own people. Many speculations surround
the alleged escape of Awadallah. One such speculation is that he is really
out of prison, whether be it a facilitated escape or not, which means that
a new wave of arrests of Hamas leaders and activists is on the way and that
he is in fact a moving target awaiting to be shot at.  Another is that he
is already dead and it's a matter of time before a corpse emerges with another
fabricated story to explain it, or simply he will or has been already handed
over to the Israeli authorities; in this case, it's up to Israel to announce
his capture or deny any involvement in the matter.<BR>
Regardless of which speculation comes close to the truth, the arrest of
Awadallah in the first place and what he went through was wrong, which indeed
holds the PA responsible for his safety and well-being.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Dangers Of Arab Self-Hate</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Muna Salman*</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>SAN FRANCISCO (AAM) </B>-- If David Letterman is to list the top ten
Arab self-haters' quick fixes and problems blamed for Arab stagnation, the
list may read like this: <BR>
Number 10 - &quot;Arab parents scold and slap their children around too
often instead of hugging them.&quot; <BR>
Number 9 - &quot;Arabs can't handle democracy. They are too tribal to care
for the greater good and too violent to have rights.&quot; <BR>
Number 8 - &quot;All Arabs want to study is engineering, computer science,
and business administration. Because of it, they are too narrow minded.&quot;
<BR>
Number 7 - &quot;The Arab male is obsessed with dominating the Arab female.
He is too uptight about sex.&quot; <BR>
Number 6 - &quot;Arabs are too cheap to contribute to their causes even
if their lives or liberties depended on it. They just like to whine about
the problem and blame everyone else for it.&quot; <BR>
Number 5 - &quot;Arabs don't exercise more often so they are not fit enough
to compete in the global race.&quot; <BR>
Number 4 - &quot;When Arabs stopped following 'real' Islam, they went downhill.&quot;
<BR>
Number 3 - &quot;Islam is the source of Arab backwardness.&quot; <BR>
Number 2 - &quot;Arab governments should add Prozac and Valium to the water
supply so Arabs would feel better about the status quo.&quot; <BR>
Jesting aside, rampant Arab pessimism has reached epidemic proportions.
I recall days when the slightest criticism of the Arab state of affairs
would attract a torrent of self-righteous counter criticism. Self-censorship
was the norm and the enemy was external. It was all black and white. Some
of us struggled like the dickens to bring some balance into the Arab-Arab
debate hoping to stimulate objective discussion and encourage even a semblance
of self-criticism. Little did we know of the Pandora's box about to open.
<BR>
A decade or so later, even a moderate defense of anything Arabic can incur
scorn and ridicule from a new genre of young and educated but pathetically
self-hating Arabs. &quot;Arab Jarab,&quot; and other sweeping condemnations
are often repeated as a ritual. The issue is not the private and &quot;recreational&quot;
expressions of self-blame. Airing it repeatedly to the general public can
be very damaging to the already battered Arab image. Neither the traditional
self-censorship nor self-hate is the answer. When will the pendulum reach
a resting point is still unclear. <BR>
Few Arab social scientist have postulated that the structure of Arab society
and norms precludes progress. While I am not in a position to directly and
credibly challenge those hypotheses, I take comfort in the presence of moderate
and highly credibly voices within the media and academia who are slashing
at conventional wisdom of self-blame. Often times their tool is as simple
as the comparative analysis afforded to them by the plethora of success
stories of developing countries in this century. While not without its flaws,
comparative analysis does cast real doubt at the array of self-blame theories
of stagnation introduced by a new generation of Arab Orientalists. <BR>
North and South Korea share a common geography, culture, and history. The
North is backward, oppressive, and crumbling rapidly. The South is vibrant
and progressive. In North Korea, human and civil rights are a rare privilege.
In the South, citizens' rights are taken for granted. What is the difference?
Not the Koreans themselves but simply the political system each regime chose
to enforce. <BR>
Even more examples have been demonstrated since the fall of communism of
how once dysfunctional regimes and economies are today leaping forward at
an impressive rate of growth. If any structural changes occurred in those
countries, they obviously followed democratization.There continues to be
social ills most developing and developed countries still wrestle with.
Conventional and prophetic structural theories of Arab progress while make
for good recreational readings, are today as credible as Communist Utopia.
<BR>
Sadly, the habitual Arab self-blame is exactly that, habitual. Sure society
bears some responsibility for the stagnation, but Arabs have demonstrated
for more than a century how adapt they are at absorbing the best of Western
culture when given the chance. <BR>
No one is advocating the censure of Arabs who no longer wish to be identified
with their community. That's an individual choice. How many German or Korean
Americans ridicule their heritage to prove their Americanness? Not too many.
<BR>
The Fouad Ajamis' of the world, while free to articulate their suspect views,
do significant damage. Being Arabs, the race card adds credibility to whatever
positions the self-haters wish to advance. For an outsider, they are considered
the insider with the real insight. To an outsider with an agenda, the Ajamis'
of the world are an ultimate Orientalist's tool to achieve questionable
political or social objectives. <BR>
But for the sake of objectivity, let us not forget Dr. Ajami was only a
willing pawn and not the executioner. And let us not loose sight of the
Iraqi regime's mortal incompetence which may have justified the initial
allied reaction. But it can never offer an explanation for the sustained
and systematic violence inflicted upon the Iraqi population. <BR>
When objectively contrasted with other US reprisals against other regional
and international threats, the immense and needless cost to human life in
Iraq reflects how much devaluation Arab lives have suffered in the eyes
of US policy makers. The US unconditional backing of Israeli violations
and violence is also an extension of the same flawed Orientalist legacy.
<BR>
Private expressions of self-hate, while unhealthy, should be tolerated but
not encouraged. Many of us experience periods of political or social disappointments
and have run the gauntlet of blame ranging from hating the self, community,
and origin to history, tradition, and religion. During those moments of
short-term despair, it is safer to provide an outlet within circles of friends
and family than to have a prolonged and damaging outburst of self-hate later
on. <BR>
Advocating a happy medium is easier said than done. The line between healthy
self-criticism and damaging self-hate is very gray. The challenge is to
channel the energy born of discontent into a more constructive outlet such
as civic involvement in and support for democratic movements in the Arab
World. Also, it takes courage and determination for some of us to break
away from a tradition of dependence and into one of self-empowerment. Of
all the Arabs around the globe, those living in the free world are better
positioned to contribute favorably to positive change in the Arab World.
<BR>
I would like to conclude by reminding myself again of where the blame primarily
lies for Arab stagnation...drum roll... <BR>
Number 1 - &quot;Arab regimes don't accept that all men are created equal,
that they are endowed by their Creator with certain unalienable Rights,
that among these are Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness.&quot;
<BR>
It is time for change so progress may follow.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Morality and Principles in the Palestinian <BR>
Struggle for Nationhood </CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ray Hanania*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>It is not unusual for Palestinians to hear others, including from our
own community, challenging the facts of the Holocaust or our relations with
people of the Jewish faith.<BR>
These feelings are a natural reflection of frustrations and emotions, and
the result of the ongoing political war between Israel and the Palestinians.<BR>
The fact that many Jews, in justifying Israel 's existence or its political
stand vis a vis the Palestinians, turn to the Holocaust as a justification
for their actions naturally evokes a counter response.<BR>
The Holocaust is not a justification for Israel 's actions against Palestinians.
It is a case for the Jewish need for a homeland and sanctuary from a primarily
non-Arab, Christian-based undercurrent of anti-Semitism.<BR>
On the otherhand, Palestinians are making a mistake if they allow their
frustrations and emotions to dictate misguided and unjustified views of
 the Holocaust or to motivate them to an embrace of anti-Semitism.<BR>
The Palestinian Struggle is a moral struggle.<BR>
It is not a struggle against Jews.<BR>
It is a struggle against a political form of Judaism-Zionism-that over the
last Century has mandated that Palestine must be the Jewish homeland.<BR>
Palestinians have never quarreled with the Jewish need for a homeland, but
they have resisted and challenged the imposition of a Jewish homeland in
Palestine.<BR>
Because the Palestinian struggle is a moral struggle, we must be protective
of the moral principles and foundations that give us justification in our
cause.<BR>
We must not allow those principles or the foundation of our righteousness
to be enticed by simplistic answers to complex problems-simplistic answers
that oftentimes undermine our ability to advocate the moral high ground.<BR>
The issue of Jews and the Holocaust is a principle element of this potential
for erosion among Palestinians.<BR>
It is natural for Palestinians to react with anger when they see Israelis
and Jews use the Holocaust as a shield to justify their own misdeeds. It
is correct for Palestinians to challenge this false notion that what is
happening in Palestine-Israel is a reflection of the same <BR>
horrendous events and factors that resulted in the Holocaust.<BR>
As Palestinians, we can respect the Holocaust and recognize it for what
it was, a horror of unprecedented magnitude perpetrated by the Nazis and
their allies against the Jewish people.<BR>
And because we challenge Israel and its policies and practices, it is natural
and proper for Palestinians to also challenge Jews.<BR>
But, it is wrong for us to direct our anger at the Jewish people.<BR>
We are not anti-Semitic and we pride our own Semitism and bond with the
people of the Torah, the Old Testament and its inherent links to both the
Christian Bible and the Islamic Quran.<BR>
At issue is the Moral Fence.<BR>
We have to learn to stand at the moral fence on every issue. It doesn 't
matter what issue it is. We should be judged by single issues. We should
be judged by principles. And one principle important to us is standing by
the moral fence on issues involving Palestinian resistance and against immoral
acts like collective punishment.<BR>
If we do that, that also means we have to stand at the same moral fence
with respect to issues that sometimes cause us pain or that sometimes evoke
our emotion, such as the Holocaust<BR>
Morality isn 't some rubber band that you stretch, pull or shrink to apply
when you need it. It is a firm measure on life. It is not a foot long. It
is not a yard long. It is not a mile long. It is a lifetime long measure
that should reflect a lifetime of positions and principles.<BR>
Just because I am a Palestinian does not mean that I hate Jews.<BR>
Just because I am a Palestinian does not mean that I will denigrate the
reality of the Holocaust.<BR>
We can take political issue with how these and other issues are applied
to our reality, but we should remember that as Palestinians, we respect
all people, Jews, Christians and Muslims.<BR>
That is why the Palestinian struggle is so righteous and just.<BR>
That is what separates us from those who would deny us our legitimate rights
to national self-determination.<BR>

<H3><CENTER>Down came the allegations</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B> By Ruba F. Farkh</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&quot;This changes everything we know about David's city. King David
didn't build a new city&quot;, commented Mr. Jed'oun Afny, the regional
archeologist and head of the excavation team that was working in the Silwan
area in East Jerusalem.  The evidence they found proved that Jerusalem was
an important and well-developed city long before it was conquered by the
Israelites 3,000 years ago. The discovery of a sophisticated water system
dating back to 1800 BC (800 years before the Talmud's alleged invasion by
King David) conflicts with the Israeli archeologists' claims that the early
Israelites were the ones who developed the city and built the water system
there. <BR>
Mr. Afny said that the discovery of the ruins of two stone towers used to
support the water network and the clay ornaments that were used to estimate
the network's age were dated back to the Kana'ni period during the mid-Bronze
Era.<BR>
This important discovery dashes the historical and religious claims by the
Israelis over the Holy City, especially the Silwan area; the so-called &quot;David's
City&quot; is currently under an active Judaization campaign rallied by
the orthodox Jews and the hawkish Jerusalem mayor Iehoud Olmert. The latest
campaign included a door-to-door fund-raising event organized by a Jewish
settlement society known as &quot;Itarit Khohaneem&quot; supported by a
letter from Iehoud Olmert encouraging Israelis to support and donate so
as to help in the efforts to expand the settlement activities carried out
by the society in East Jerusalem, especially in the Silwan area and the
old city.  &quot;No doubt that every public and financial support helps,
and will enhance our control over the city.  Also it provides an opportunity
to proceed with more settlement activities, which, in the long run, will
serve the goal&quot;, wrote Iehoud Olmert in his letter. Pictures and pamphlets
showing the society's settlement activities and the places established or
taken over by its activists in the heart of the Arab neighbourhood within
the walls of the old city were distributed by the Itarit Khohaneem members
during visits to the houses and settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</P>

<P>The pamphlets focused on the northern part of the Islamic neighbourhood
next to the Al Aqsa Mosque gates targeting the &quot;Al Sahera&quot; area
as a top-priority site for expanding settlement activities.  The society
aims to start a new project there-an &quot;educational-cultural village&quot;
within the boundaries of the old city.  The village will be named after
one of the society's activists who was killed last year.<BR>
According to the pamphlets, the Itarit Khohaneem society claims ownership
of around 38 buildings in the old city, all of which they plan to move into
within the next few months. Itarit Khohaneem claims that the population
of the old city is around 31,600 of which 2,400 (7.5%) are Jews; 22,000
(69.6%) are Muslims; 4,900 (15.5%) are Palestinian Christians; and 2,200
(7%) are Armenian Christians. The society claims that the population of
the old city in 1900 was 37,000 of which 20,000 were Jews, i.e. around 54.1%
of the population, insinuating by such that the Jewish population was the
one targeted by evacuation plans not the reverse, thus justifying their
efforts to plant the Jews amongst the Palestinian population in the old
city.<BR>
On the other side of the Holy City, the Israeli Government authorized one
of its companies known as &quot;Amedar&quot; to kick off an intensified
campaign to sell &quot;Absentee properties&quot; in West Jerusalem that
belong to Palestinians who were evacuated from the city and were forced
to leave their houses and properties during the 1948 war and after the establishment
of Israel.<BR>
Within a week's time last month the company had sold 45 pieces of property
(houses and apartments) holding the &quot;Absentee properties&quot; title.
These pieces of property were sold very cheap with lenient conditions for
Jewish buyers; the whole deal was closed at around half of its given worth
in the free market.<BR>
This campaign, which comes in harmony with the general Israeli policies
towards the Palestinians and the creation of a new status quo in preparation
for the final stage negotiations, was in fact an attempt by the Israeli
Government to make sure that no claims can be made by the rightful owners,
whether it be within the context of a future settlement to the refugees
issue or in the case of individual or collective lawsuits.<BR>
In the same context, one should take note of the recent Israeli report drafted
by senior officials in the Israeli cabinet in which the Arab citizens in
the 1948-occupied land (State of Israel) are considered to be a &quot;possible
strategic threat&quot; to Israel.  The report warned of the development
of seclusion ideology in the Arab society, especially that pertaining to
the concept through which the State of Israel is perceived as the State
of all its citizens thus, in a sense, erasing the very foundation of the
Jewish State and the Zionist dependency.<BR>
The team that wrote this unprecedented report consisted of the ministers
of defense, infrastructure, interior security, interior affairs and tourism.
 They discussed extensively the activities of the Islamic movement in the
1948 land where it emphasized that although the &quot;Islamic emergence
is still limited, never the less it has a serious and threatening energy&quot;.
 It also stated that the Islamic movement has widespread relations with
Islamic organizations throughout the world, including Hamas, not to mention
its leader's long list of quotes &quot;inciting&quot; feelings against the
Jewish people. The report also warned that the Islamic movement is seeking
the fulfillment of illegal goals using legal means, including the establishment
of an Islamic State in place of Israel, directing the Arab citizens to return
to their Islamic teachings, which idealism is spreading through mosques
in an attempt to reclaim Arab ownership by provoking the people against
the State of Israel.<BR>
In spite of everything done, whether be it regarding the Israeli policies
and practices against the Arab citizens of Jerusalem or the Arab citizens
of the State of Israel, it is obvious that the main goal of the Israeli
Government and its leaders is to drive the Arab population out. Indeed,
these practices prove only one thing: the Jewish State is a racial and discriminative
State-it is non-tolerant to others. <BR>
Therefore, one can expect the worst if the tailoring of the Palestinian
refugees' future is left to the Israelis in the final status negotiations.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Issue of Palestinian Refugees: Present and Future*</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Mahmoud al-Khatib<BR>
(1-2)</B></CENTER></P>

<P>The issue of the Palestinian refugees appears to be one of the most complex
human and political issues still awaiting a solution in the context of the
&quot;final status&quot; negotiations due to be held next year between the
Israeli government and the PLO.  It is a problem which arose initially out
of organized Jewish terrorism against Palestinians in the form of massacres
which were carried out by Jewish terrorist gangs in a number of Arab villages
and cities with the purpose of frightening their inhabitants and forcing
them to leave their lands and possessions behind.  These massacres took
place during the period prior to and immediately following the Arab-Israeli
war of 1948.<BR>
The essential problem which faces these refugees lies in the fact that the
Jewish state rests on confiscated Palestinian lands, while their possessions
were stolen from them to become a source of power and a resource for building
up the state of Israel.  Moreover, added to this problem is the frustration
which surrounds the Palestinians' cause, a frustration resulting from the
manner in which the international community has dealt with this issue, considering
it to be merely a humanitarian concern without taking into account its fundamentally
political nature.<BR>
At the present time, more than 3.5 million Palestinian refugees live in
refugee camps. Over the past fifty years, many of these refugees have endured
social and economic conditions about which the least that may be said is
that they are utterly miserable.  As the Jewish occupiers live lives of
ease on lands belonging to Palestinian refugees, and as they enjoy possessions
taken from them, they ask the international community to provide them security
and to guarantee the survival of their state through the imposition of peace
agreements which are unjust to the Palestinians as well as to other Arabs
involved.  And even as these things take place, Palestinian refugees are
denied the protection enjoyed by virtually all other refugees in the world.
 It is not only peculiar, but positively deplorable, that all refugees in
the world should enjoy the right of protection represented by efforts to
return them to their homelands while Palestinian refugees alone are deprived
of this right.<BR>
The PLO committed a serious error when it signed the Oslo accords with the
Israeli government in 1993 before arriving at a solution to critical issues
such as the situation of Palestinian refugees, of occupied Jerusalem and
of the Jewish settlements on the West Bank and the Gaza strip.  Instead,
these matters were postponed until what is known as the &quot;final status
talks&quot; due to begin next year.  In so doing, the PLO granted the Jewish
state a &quot;lease&quot; on peace and safety without giving the Palestinians
themselves a sense of hope for a just, lasting, comprehensive solution to
their critical concerns.<BR>
In order to clarify the problem of the Palestinian refugees, a problem which
does not receive sufficient attention on the part of the international community,
we are presenting this paper in a humble attempt to shed light on the size
of the problem, the conditions in which refugees live in the camps, and
proposed solutions to the problem.  </P>

<P><B>One - Definition:</B><BR>
The &quot;Palestinian refugee&quot; is defined by the UN as follows:<BR>
&quot;A Palestine refugee is a person whose normal residence was Palestine
for a minimum of two years preceding the conflict in 1948 and who, as a
result of this conflict, lost both his home and his means of livelihood
and took refuge in 1948 in one of the countries where UNRWA provides relief.
 Refugees within this definition and the direct descendants of such refugees
are eligible for Agency assistance if they are: registered with UNRWA; living
in the area of UNRWA operations; and in need.&quot; </P>

<P><BR>
<B>Two:  Numbers and Locations of Refugees</B><BR>
There are no precise statistics concerning the numbers of Palestinian refugees
due to their being dispersed throughout a large number of countries of the
world.  Moreover, the statistics which are available are those provided
by UNRWA on the refugees registered with it.  There are many other refugees,
however, who are not registered with UNRWA, as UNRWA figures do not include
those who emigrated to Iraq, Egypt, Europe or America after the war of 1948.
Rather, they include only those refugees registered within its five fields
of operation, namely: the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon.<BR>
The number of Palestinian refugees who left their lands before, during and
after the Arab-Israeli war of 1948 came to approximately 800,000 persons,
more than half of whom left prior to the end of the British mandate over
Palestine in May, 1948.  These Palestinians were forced to leave their villages
and cities after terrorist Jewish gangs carried out massacres estimated
by some sources at 33 massacres during the year 1948 alone. Lawyer Wakim
Wakim, an activist in defense of refugees' rights in occupied Palestinian
territories, recounts a Jewish testimony given in 1948 to the effect that
Jewish gangs carried out more than 90 massacres similar to that at Deir
Yasin.<BR>
Zionist gangs were in fact carrying on a psychological war the purpose of
which was to force the inhabitants of cities and villages located near those
in which massacres had occurred to leave their homes and possessions.  In
addition, some Palestinians were obliged to leave their homeland on direct
orders from some of the Arab armies which were present in Palestine during
the 1948 war.<BR>
The majority of Palestinian refugees sought refuge in areas not far from
their original towns and villages in hopes of returning once the war had
died down.  Hence, those living in north Palestine fled for protection to
Lebanon and Syria, while those living in the central and southern parts
of Palestine fled to the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Jordan.	<BR>
According to the most recently available official UNRWA statistics, the
number of Palestinian refugees registered with it comes to approximately
3.5 million, a figure which represents the natural growth in their numbers.
 These refugees are found in 59 different camps in UNRWA's five fields of
operation.<BR>
This does not mean, of course, that all Palestinian refugees live in UNRWA-administered
refugee camps.   Approximately 67% of them live outside the camps, either
in one of the five fields of operation or somewhere else in the world.</P>

	Totals:		59	1,117,567	2,300,121	3,417,688</P>

<P><B>Four:  Refugees' Conditions</B><BR>
Approximately 33% of the refugees registered with UNRWA live in refugee
camps located in various areas within the five fields of operation.  These
refugees endure pitiable living conditions, making their homes in small
houses of mud or cement.  Many of these houses, termed &quot;shelters&quot;,
have roofs of tin or asbestos, as a result of which those living in such
houses are exposed to the elements all year round.  Entire families, some
of which number more than 20 members, have to live cramped inside such dwellings,
which generally cover an area of no more than 80-100 square meters.  The
reason for this is that the area designated for each refugee camp is limited,
with expansion being made impossible by the fact that the camps are generally
surrounded on all sides by urban areas.  Moreover, if one of the family
members wishes to marry, he is obliged in many cases to live in the same
house as his parents and siblings due to refugees' difficult economic conditions.
 As for those financially capable of moving out, they may live outside the
camps provided that the laws of the host country concerned permit this.
 <BR>
The Palestinian refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip have lived since
1967 under Israeli occupation.  Hence they, like other residents of the
West Bank and Gaza, are subject to the arbitrary practices of the Israeli
occupation forces such as arbitrary detention, raids, closure of checkpoints
leading to places of work inside Israel (such work being their primary source
of livelihood), and travel bans.  Due to Israeli security policies and constant
closures, the unemployment rate among Palestinians in the occupied territories,
among them refugees, sometimes soars to more than 60%.<BR>
Palestinian refugees living on the West Bank carry temporary Jordanian passports
which enable them to travel to Jordan or various other countries despite
the difficulties imposed upon them by various governments in response to
this type of passport.  As for refugees living in the Gaza Strip, they carry
Egyptian travel documents due to the fact that the Gaza Strip was, until
its occupation by Israel in 1967, under Egyptian administration.  <BR>
Refugees living in Jordan, who represent up to 40% of the total number of
refugees registered with UNRWA, are considered Jordanian citizens and enjoy
all the rights enjoyed by Jordanian citizens themselves.  They carry regular
Jordanian passports, and have the right to vote and to hold office, both
in local precincts and in Parliament.  Moreover, they enjoy full rights
to public services provided by the Jordanian government to its own citizens,
such as higher education and the opportunity to work in the government sector.<BR>
Those residing in Lebanon, by contrast, face the harshest economic and social
conditions of all Palestinian refugees. They carry Lebanese travel documents
which are not recognized by most countries in the world.  In addition, the
Lebanese government requires these refugees to obtain permits to return
to Lebanon if they travel outside the country, and in some cases they have
been denied permission to reenter Lebanon, something which has caused them
severe difficulties. An example may be seen in what happened to the Palestinians
holding Lebanese travel documents who had been living in Libya and who were
then ousted by the Libyan government in September, 1995.  These refugees
have suffered the effects of the Lebanese civil war and of the constant
Israeli aggression against Palestinian camps in Lebanon, not to mention
the massacres carried out by Israeli forces in collaboration with Christian
Lebanese forces such as those which occurred in the Tell al-Za'tar camp
in 1976 and at Sabra and Shatila in the summer of 1982.<BR>
The Lebanese government does not permit Palestinian refugees to work without
a work permit issued by the Lebanese authorities.  They are not permitted
to work in the public sector under any circumstances, nor may they be employed
in more than seventy professions in the private sector.  For this reason,
the social and economic circumstances facing Palestinian refugees in Lebanon
are more difficult than those faced by refugees in any of the other fields
of operation.<BR>
In Syria, refugees enjoy the same rights as those enjoyed by Syrian citizens
with the exception of the right to vote or hold office.  They hold not Syrian
passports but Syrian travel documents, a fact which poses grave difficulties
for them if they do travel abroad due to the refusal of many governments
to recognize such documents.<BR>
Regarding those refugees not registered with UNRWA, insufficient information
is available for us to comment upon them here. However, there are believed
to be approximately 250,000 Palestinian refugees living in Iraq since 1948
and who were not registered with UNRWA at that time due to the fact that
the Iraqi government committed itself to take them under its wing and to
guarantee them the right to reside there.  Most of them carry Iraqi travel
documents and enjoy full rights of citizenship with the exception of the
right to vote.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Five Imperatives Of Palestinian Political Action</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Lara Drake*</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B>I. Introduction</B><BR>
In discussing the political imperatives facing the Palestine movement, it
is important to start with the meaning of the term 'imperatives'. Imperatives
are something above the agenda of today or tomorrow, something larger. They
are about matters of survival, survival of the Palestinians as a people,
as a political singularity capable of speaking to the world with one voice.
Such an attribute is not inconsistent with political plurality, the multitude
of changing political trends and factions that have always existed under
the framework of the PLO. For it is one thing for the Palestinians to speak
to each other in a plurality of voices, but at the end of the day, they
must be capable of presenting a single voice to the world outside.<BR>
Without this capability, the Palestinians will become the next Armenians,
the next Kurds-people who have been reduced to mere ethnic minorities. Once
the idea of the common destiny is lost, the various segments of a former
people have nothing in common except the objective attributes, such as language
and religion, and maybe even a common past, but not a common future. The
primary imperative, then, for the Palestinian movement is to arrest the
progression of this type of fragmentation, accelerated by Oslo, to protect
the survivability of the Palestinian people in order to propel them toward
a common future.</P>

<P><B>II. The Inside-Outside Link</B><BR>
This means, first and foremost, restoring the severed link between the Palestinians
inside Palestine, under occupation in both the 1948 and the 1967 areas,
and the Palestinians in exile, both in the cities and refugee camps of Arab
cordon States and in faraway locations such as Europe and America. After
all, the Palestinian population of close to 6 million, split almost evenly
between inside and outside as it is, is an inherently dichotomous entity.
But today the linkages are faltering, owing to &quot;Israeli&quot; strategies
to cut apart the unity of the Palestinian people by turning the knife of
fragmentation at many different angles.<BR>
&quot;Israel&quot; via Oslo has fragmented the inside from the outside Palestinians
by creating an objective divergence of interests between them. After all,
without the right of return, even to the unlikely Palestinian mini-State,
the outside Palestinians have no interests in common with those inside.
They have no future to hope for from Oslo but the finality of the dissolution
of their rights, their final severance from the larger Palestinian body,
and the &quot;solution&quot; of their problem as refugees in terms of individuals,
scattering them one last time to the various ends of the earth.<BR>
There are &quot;Israeli&quot; plans in place right now to remove the refugees
from the doors to their homeland, especially those in Lebanon, and to send
them to faraway places such as Iraq, Sudan, Australia, Canada, Scandanavia
and the United States. The &quot;Israelis&quot; have even used the chairman
of the International Relations Committee of the United States Congress to
petition the southern Gulf States of the GCC to each accept 30,000 Palestinian
refugees from Lebanon, thereby ending for them the refugee question as a
political question, and foreclosing the implementation of the Palestinian
right of return as an historical possibility once and for all. Fortunately,
the target States have refused these plans, at least for now.<BR>
This means in the first instance that the responsibility falls on the Palestinian
movement not to allow the &quot;Israelis&quot; to redefine the Palestinian
people in reductionist form as Camp David did, as &quot;the inhabitants
of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.&quot; It requires focusing more political,
diplomatic, strategic and public relations attention on the Palestinian
refugee question, restoring it to the centre of the problem where it deserves
to be, as one of the critical problems to be solved in accordance with inalienable
Palestinian rights, as a question with the same historical and political
weight as the settlements or the status of Jerusalem. <BR>
It requires the practical act of restoring the PLO funds and services to
the refugees in Syria and Lebanon, to make up for the severe cutbacks in
contributions by UNRWA and the international charities. It requires the
Palestinian movement to energetically and enthusiastically seek out and
expose all those schemes aimed at re-scattering the refugees outside to
faraway destinations and using all available means to combat those schemes
and prevent them from reaching fruition. It also requires that the successor
or successors to Arafat, specifically as head of the PLO (as opposed to
the Palestinian Authority), to be acceptable to the Palestinians outside
as well as inside, and that the outside half be given the chance to participate
meaningfully and actively in the succession debate.<BR>
After all, the Palestinians outside have participated equally in Palestinian
suffering as those inside, if not more so; their rights are no less salient,
and their coherence as a political force is no less vital to the ultimate
survivability of the Palestinian people as a nation. The Palestinian tragedy
is defined just as much by exile as it is by occupation; indeed, the very
birth of the Palestinian problem resulted in the first instance from an
act of exile and only secondly from an act of occupation onto the emptied
lands.</P>

<P><B>III. The Emigration War</B><BR>
Palestinians in the refugee camps outside are becoming increasingly attracted
to the prospect of emigration; this is particularly rampant among the new
generation. The cause is a variety of &quot;push&quot; factors, including
economic destitution and distress and lack of hope in returning to Palestine,
combined with foreign &quot;pull&quot; factors deliberately exerted by &quot;Israeli&quot;
interests in bringing about Palestinian self-dispersion. Doors of immigration
are miraculously opening in many Western countries, complete with propaganda
enticing them to leave their temporary homes for permanent ones outside
Palestine. The result has been the gradual yet alarming de-population of
the refugee camps; the Beirut camps, for instance, have lost fully half
their populations in the last 5-10 years.<BR>
Even more startling is that the emigration scheme is being targeted by foreign
forces, not only against Palestinians outside, but equally among those inside,
even in PA areas. In the Gaza Strip, for instance, Palestinians report that
the foreign advertisements encouraging emigration from Palestine have recently
been on the increase. And there is a growing tendency on the part of these
Palestinians to be attracted to the foreign attempts to &quot;pull&quot;
them out, given the disastrous economic situation imposed on the inside
by the post-1993 Israeli siege operation called by the name of &quot;closure&quot;.
Even the most enthusiastic former political cadres are now contemplating
emigration, not for themselves, they say, but for the sake of their children.<BR>
Exposing these foreign schemes, which can be called under the general heading
of the &quot;emigration war&quot;, and inventing strategies to counter them,
represent another urgent political imperative facing the Palestinian movement.
It requires taking political, diplomatic, strategic, and public relations
steps to counter the operational aspects of the foreign schemes, both above
and below the ground. Failure to face this imperative will result in the
gradual erosion of the Palestinian population base and in another wave of
de-population, both from Palestine itself and from surrounding areas outside.
One way to face it is through mass education regarding the dangers of emigration,
and by providing something constructive for those Palestinians to do other
than emigrate; the leadership must give them both the means and the hope
to stay where they are, and a political reason to do so.</P>

<P><B>IV. Contingency Planning For Pa Failure</B><BR>
The truth is that the &quot;Israelis&quot; have found in Oslo a solution
to their Intifadah problem: a way to withdraw from the people without withdrawing
from the land. Today, the Palestinians under occupation cannot even see
the faces of their enemies due to the physical interpolation of PA soldiers.
It is common for all people to focus on what is right in front of their
face rather than on the big picture, and right now it is the Palestinian
Authority that is right in front of their face. However, Israel remains
there as it was before, surrounding them, imprisoning them inside their
small enclosures, preventing almost all travel to or through East Jerusalem,
and completely cutting off all movement between the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
to the point where people have begun to refer to travel between them in
the same terms as &quot;traveling overseas&quot;-all this is done in the
name of peace.<BR>
Let no one imagine the West Bank is approaching Statehood; if anything,
it is being absorbed even more rapidly. One comparison of the reality on
the ground in the West Bank today versus three or four years ago reveals
that the West Bank is beginning to look more and more like the colonized
1948 areas and less and less like Palestine, with the exception of the legalization
of Palestinian national symbols in the populated cities.  Over the course
of this time, the signs have been removed from the Palestinian villages,
and the Green Line, if anything, has been erased.<BR>
This leads to the very important conclusive imperative, which is the creation
of a contingency plan in the event that the PA should fall or be destroyed
as a national force. This could happen as a result of a multitude of factors.
It could happen by virtue of an Israeli-Palestinian war, between the Israeli
army and the Palestinian police, the so-called &quot;Intifadah with weapons.&quot;
It could happen as a result of a crisis of succession, in the midst of which
the PA is so weakened that Israel is able to find a leader or leaders who
will do its bidding truly, and in which the PA is transformed into the 1990s
version of the Village Leagues. It is at that time that the Palestinian
General Lahad will emerge, or even two Lahads, one responsible for the West
Bank cities and one for Gaza, or a plurality of Lahads, one responsible
for each &quot;autonomous&quot; area, with no connection between them except
the competition for U.S. and Israeli favour. It could happen by virtue of
&quot;Israeli&quot; intransigence, in which the PA loses credibility as
a national force capable of ever liberating the West Bank and Gaza Strip
through negotiations; this is the particular track on which history is currently
moving.<BR>
Given these possibilities, and history (like physics) is all about the probable
realization of possibilities, a central imperative emerges-the imperative
of a post-Oslo contingency. There must be a contingency plan by the PLO
in case the PA collapses or is altered beyond recognition. For even if the
Palestinian Authority dies, the Palestinian people must still live. And
it must be understood that the central feature dictating the effectiveness
of a contingency plan is that its preparation must be completed before the
historical inevitability of the projected contingency has become obvious.<BR>
To prepare for such a contingency, it is imperative to restore substance
to the PLO structure and not allow the organization to become an empty shell.
It is not strategically sound to encapsulate the entire substance of Palestinian
existence in the weak and fragile PA, which exists in a context of an Israeli
occupation that surrounds and imprisons it, and which may someday destroy
it; it is more sound to leave some of the substance in the more independent
framework of the PLO, which is international and not surrounded, and hence,
not so easily destroyed. The PLO can be something larger and higher than
the PA, representing all Palestinians everywhere, inside and outside. <BR>
Also, owing to the lingering uncertainties, it is important to leave some
of the important PLO figures and cadres on the outside, not only the PLO
foreign minister in Tunis, but also the leaders of the refugee populations
outside. Removing these leaderships to the inside will do nothing but deprive
huge sections of the Palestinian people of whatever semblance of leadership
they have left, to very little gain, all the while making the PLO even more
vulnerable by bringing all its capable figures and fighting forces under
the jurisdiction of Israel, and within its easy reach. And, in the final
analysis, what kind of leaders would they be if all of them returned to
Palestine without bringing their people home with them? It only makes sense
for all the outside leaders to return when an independent State has been
declared and the refugees are given the practical option of returning to
the territory of such a State.<BR>
It is equally imperative to create a structure of survivability within the
PLO organization, something capable of existing if need be in a post-Oslo
or post-PA phase, some phoenix that could rise intact from the ashes of
a fallen, collapsed, or altered PA.</P>

<P><B>V. The Imperative Of Reviving The Military Option</B><BR>
Finally, and I left this until the last to emphasize its importance, the
PLO must never, never give up its military option, either inside or outside,
for this is its only source of leverage.  And by this, I do not refer to
the &quot;threat&quot; of another Intifadah.  After all, the Intifadah was
a unique war in that it was conducted by civilians, including many children,
but today the civilians are tired and cannot be asked to do such a thing
again. Furthermore, &quot;Israel&quot; is not afraid of another Intifadah,
because the new structures of closure and prevention of normal Palestinian
movement do not support Intifadah-style combat or Intifadah tactics.  Fighting
a new Intifadah is the same as fighting the last war and it will not work.
While the people may do it under instructions, their heart will not be in
it. They are cynical about it because they think it is only for show, and
that they are being asked to sacrifice as civilians simply for purposes
of show.<BR>
This means that the military option should be of para-military form and
not civilian form. If there must be a model, it should not be that of the
Intifadah; instead it should embody a combination of Hezbollah and Hamas
tactics to be implemented anywhere in the country and not specifically in
the West Bank or Gaza Strip. The military option that should be preserved
is of the old style, and I am not saying whether or not it should be put
into operation now or whether it should stand dormant, only that it is imperative
that such structures and capabilities be quietly constructed and preserved
fully intact.<BR>
&quot;Israel&quot; will not surrender its military option against the Palestinians,
peace agreement or no peace agreement, and therefore, what strategic logic
dictates that the much weaker Palestinian side should do so? After all,
whoever in world politics made concessions to a powerless enemy, incapable
of violence? The answer is no one. States do not concede power to others
out of altruism, or because of justice or recognition of rights or any of
the other synonyms for altruism. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Structure of the Talmud</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Israel Shahak</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><B>Part 7</B></CENTER></P>

<P>It should therefore be clearly understood that the source of authority
for all the practices of classical (and present-day Orthodox) Judaism, the
determining base of its legal structure, is the Talmud, or, to be precise,
the so-called Babylonian Talmud: while the rest of the talmudic literature
)including the so-called Jerusalem or Palestinian Talmud) acts as a supplementary
authority.<BR>
We cannot enter here into a detailed description of the Talmud and talmudic
literature, but confine ourselves to a few principal points needed for our
argument. Basically, the Talmud consists of two parts. First, the Mishnah-
a terse legal code consisting of six volumes, each subdivided into several
tractates, written in Hebrew, redacted in Palestine around AD 200 out of
the much more extensive (and largely oral) legal material composed during
the preceding two centuries. The second and by far predominant part is the
Gemarah - a voluminous record of discussions on and around the Mishnah.
There are two, roughly parallel, sets of Gemarah. one composed in Mesopotamia
('Babylon') between about AD 200 and 500, the other in Palestine between
about AD 200 and some unknown date long before 500. The Babylonian Talmud
( that is, the Mishnah plus the Mesopotamian Gemarah) is much more extensive
and better arranged than the Palestinian, and it alone is regarded as definitive
and authoritative. The Jerusalem (Palestinian) Talmud is accorded a decidedly
lower status as a legal authority, along with a number of compilations,
known collectively as the 'talmudic literature', containing material which
the editors of the two Talmuds had left out.<BR>
	Contrary to the Mishnah, the rest of the Talmud and talmudic literature
is written in a mixture of Hebrew and Aramaic, the latter language predominating
in the Babylonian Talmud. Also, it is not limited to legal matters. Without
any apparent order or reason, the legal discussion can suddenly be interrupted
by what is referred to as 'Narrative' (Aggadah) - a medley of tales and
anecdotes about rabbis or ordinary folk, biblical figures, angels, demons,
witchcraft and miracles. These narrative passages, although of great popular
influence in Judaism through the ages, were always considered (even by the
Talmud itself) as having secondary value. Of greatest importance for classical
Judaism are the legal parts of the text, particularly the discussion of
cases which are regarded as problematic. The Talmud itself defines the various
categories of Jews, in ascending order, as follows. The lowest are the totally
ignorant, then come those who only know the Bible, then those who are familiar
with the Mishnah or Aggadah, and the superior class are those who have studied,
and are able to discuss the legal part of the Gemarah. It is only the latter
who are fit to lead their fellow Jews in all things.<BR>
The legal system of the Talmud can be described as totally comprehensive,
rigidly authoritarian, and yet capable of infinite development, without
however any change in its dogmatic base. Every aspect of Jewish life, both
individual and social, is covered; usually in considerable detail, with
sanctions and punishments provided for every conceivable sin or infringement
of the rules. The basic rules for every problem are stated dogmatically
and cannot be questioned. What can be and is discussed at very great length
is the elaboration and practical definition of these rules. Let me give
a few examples.<BR>
'Not doing any work' on the sabbath. The concept work is defined as comprising
exactly 39 types of work, neither more nor less. The criterion for inclusion
in this list has nothing to do with the arduousness of a given task; it
is simply a matter of dogmatic definition. One forbidden type of 'work'
is writing. The question then arises: How many characters must one write
in order to commit the sin of writing on the sabbath? (Answer: Two). Is
the sin the same, irrespective of which hand is used? (Answer: No). However,
in order to guard against falling into sin, the primary prohibition on writing
is hedged with a secondary ban on touching any writing implement on the
sabbath.<BR>
Another prototypical work forbidden on the sabbath is the grinding of grain.
From this it is deduced, by analogy, that any kind of grinding of anything
whatsoever is forbidden. And this in turn is hedged by a ban on the practice
of medicine on the sabbath (except in cases of danger to Jewish life), in
order to guard against falling into the sin of grinding a medicament. It
is in vain to point out that in modern times such a danger does not exist
(nor, for that matter, did it exist in many cases even in talmudic times);
for, as a hedge around the hedge, the Talmud explicitly forbids liquid medicines
and restorative drinks on the sabbath. What has been fixed remains for ever
fixed, however absurd. Tertullian. one of the early Church Fathers, had
written, 'I believe it because it is absurd.' This can serve as a motto
for the majority of talmudic rules, with the word 'believe' replaced by
'practise'.<BR>
The following example illustrates even better the level of absurdity reached
by this system. One of the prototypes of work forbidden on the sabbath is
harvesting. This is stretched, by analogy, to a ban on breaking a branch
off a tree. Hence, riding a horse (or any other animal) is forbidden, as
a hedge against the temptation to break a branch off a tree for flogging
the beast It is useless to argue that you have a ready-made whip, or that
you intend to ride where there are no trees. What is forbidden remains forbidden
for ever. It can, however, be stretched and made stricter: in modern times,
riding a bicycle on the sabbath has been forbidden, because it is analogous
to riding a horse.<BR>
My final example illustrates how the same methods are used also in purely
theoretical cases, having no conceivable application in reality. During
the existence of the Temple, the High Priest was only allowed to marry a
virgin. Although during virtually the whole of the talmudic period there
was no longer a Temple or a High Priest, the Talmud devotes one of its more
involved (and bizarre) discussions to the precise definition of the term
'virgin' fit to marry a High Priest. What about a woman whose hymen had
been broken by accident? Does it make any difference whether the accident
occurred before or after the age of three? By the impact of metal or of
wood? Was she climbing a tree? And if so, was she climbing up or down? Did
it happen naturally or unnaturally? All this and much else besides is discussed
in lengthy detail. And every scholar in classical Judaism had to master
hundreds of such problems. Great scholars were measured by their ability
to develop these problems still further, for as shown by the examples there
is always scope for further development- if only in one direction - and
such development did actually continue after the final redaction of the
Talmud.<BR>
However, there are two great differences between the talmudic period (ending
around AD 500) and the period of classical Judaism (from about AD 800).
The geographical area reflected in the Talmud is confined, whereas the Jewish
society reflected in it is a 'complete society, with Jewish agriculture
as its basis. (This is true for Mesopotamia as well as  Palestine.) Although
at that time there were Jews living throughout the Roman Empire and in many
areas of the Sassanid Empire, it is quite evident from the talmudic text
that its composition- over half a millennium - was a strictly local affair.
No scholars from countries other than Mesopotamia and Palestine took part
in it, nor does the text reflect social conditions outside these two areas.<BR>
Very little is known about the social and religious conditions of the Jews
in the intervening three centuries. But from AD 800 on, when more detailed
historical information is again available, we find that the two features
mentioned above had been reversed. The Babylonian Talmud (and to a much
lesser degree the rest of the talmudic literature) is acknowledged as authoritative,
studied and developed in all Jewish communities. At the same time, Jewish
society had undergone a deep change: whatever and wherever it is, it does
not include peasants.<BR>
	<BR>
<B>The Dispensations</B><BR>
As noted above, the talmudic system is most dogmatic and does not allow
any relaxation of its rules even when they are reduced to absurdity by a
change in circumstances. And in the case of the Talmud - contrary to that
of the Bible - the literal sense of the text is binding. and one is not
allowed to interpret it away. But in the period of classical Judaism various
talmudic laws became untenable for the Jewish ruling classes - the rabbis
and the rich. In the interest of these ruling classes, a method of systematic
deception was devised for keeping the letter of the law, while violating
its spirit and intention. It was this hypocritical system of 'dispensations'
(heterim) which, in my view, was the most important cause of the debasement
of Judaism in its classical epoch. (The second cause was Jewish mysticism,
which however operated for a much shorter period of time.) Again, some examples
are needed to illustrate how the system works.</P>

<P><B><I>1. Taking of interest</I></B>. The Talmud strictly forbids a Jew,
on pain of severe punishment, to take interest on a loan made to another
Jew. (According to a majority of talmudic authorities, it is a religious
duty to take as much interest as possible on a loan made to a Gentile.)
Very detailed rules forbid even the most far-fetched forms in which a Jewish
lender might benefit from a Jewish debtor. All Jewish accomplices to such
an illicit transaction, including the scribe and the witnesses, are branded
by the Talmud as infamous persons, disqualified from testifying in court,
because by participating in such an act, a Jew as good as declares that
'he has no part in the god of Israel'. It is evident that this law is well
suited to the needs of Jewish peasants or artisans, or of small Jewish communities
who use their money for lending to non-Jews. But the situation was very
different in east Europe (mainly in Poland) by the 16th century. There was
a relatively big Jewish community, which constituted the majority in many
towns. The peasants, subjected to strict serfdom not far removed from slavery,
were hardly in a position to borrow at all, while lending to the nobility
was the business of a few very rich Jews. Many Jews were doing business
with each other.<BR>
In these circumstances, the following arrangement (called heter'isqa- 'business
dispensation') was devised for an interest-bearing loan between Jews, which
does not violate the letter of the law, because formally it is not a loan
at all. The lender 'invests' his money in the business of the borrower,
stipulating two conditions. First, that the borrower will pay the lender
at an agreed future date a stated sum of money (in reality, the interest
in the loan) as the lender's 'share in the profits'. Secondly, that the
borrower will be presumed to have made sufficient profit to give the lender
his share, unless a claim to the contrary is corroborated by the testimony
of the town's rabbi or rabbinical judge, etc. - who, by arrangement, refuse
to testify in such cases. In practice all that is required is to take a
text of this dispensation, written in Aramaic and entirely incomprehensible
to the great majority, and put it on a wall of the room where the transaction
is made (a copy of this text is displayed in all branches of Israeli banks)
or even to keep it in a chest - and the interest-bearing loan between Jews
becomes perfectly legal and blameless.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The First Stone</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By E. Yaghi</B></CENTER></P>

<P>&quot;...even presidents have private lives.&quot; Bill Clinton<BR>
Millions of Americans were glued to their television sets on Monday, 17
August 1998, to hear President Bill Clinton's confession of his &quot;not
appropriate&quot; relationship with former White House intern, Monica Lewinsky.
 It is strange that so many Americans have been interested, even intrigued,
nearly to the point of obsession by the private life of their president
at a period of time when the moral integrity of the average American is
at an all-time low and when AIDS is the almost rampant disease of the century.<BR>
That Ms. Lewinsky could be so brazen as to publicly admit that she had any
kind of relationship other than a working one with the U.S. president is
an indication of the total absence of any morals on her part as well.  She
may have sought and found fame (though perhaps temporary and tainted), perhaps
may even have gained a new source of income, but what she has really stated
about herself is that she is little better than a call girl and therefore
does not have the right to blame anyone else but herself for her own promiscuous
behaviour.<BR>
When there is so much strife around the world, when so many people are starving,
when so many lack the basic essentials that so many affluent others take
for granted, Independent counsel Kenneth Starr has spent four years and
$40 million investigating allegations of wrongdoing by the Clintons.  It
is still unknown how strong Starr's case against the president is for obstructing
justice or tampering with witnesses, but whatever the outcome, Bill Clinton's
remaining two years in office will be spent with his having less moral authority,
less clout, and his becoming more weakened and humiliated.<BR>
On the other hand, Israeli editorialists view the Monica Lewinsky affair
as a blessing in disguise for Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu as a weakened
President Bill Clinton would not risk trying to pressure Israel over the
stalled Middle East process.  The independent Israeli newspaper Ha'aretz
predicted that Clinton would use his remaining two years in office to recover.
 Netanyahu has for months ignored appeals by the Clinton administration
that he cede another 13% of the West Bank to Palestinian control in order
to revive the peace negotiations which have been incapacitated for the last
18 months.<BR>
Too bad the private life of President Clinton couldn't have remained exactly
that-private-and such moral trivia as the Monica Lewinsky affair acknowledged
as typically &quot;American,&quot; so that the more important matters at
hand, such as the Middle East Peace Process, the stagnancy of the former
Soviet Union and the twin bombings of American embassies in East Africa,
could be more thoroughly investigated and justly dealt with.<BR>
Nevertheless, the retaliatory bombings on 20 August 1998 of an alleged chemical
weapons factory (in reality a pharmaceutical factory) in Khartoum, Sudan,
and the attack on a paramilitary base in Afghanistan (in order to strike
at Saudi rebel millionaire, Ousama Ben Laden) by American missiles is basically
not only a terrorist act, but also sinister and evil. The intention is to
cover up Clinton's shame and to draw not only the attention of the American
public away from the Lewinsky affair, but also divert the attention of the
international community.<BR>
As for those Americans eagerly waiting to punish Bill Clinton for his former
illicit private affairs, the one who is without guilt should cast the first
stone.   <BR>
The $40 million dollars spent on the Lewinsky affair could have done wonders
for impoverished people around the globe; it could have helped restore the
inalienable rights of those masses who still crave human dignity and a grain
of freedom.  There are mothers all over the world that haven't got enough
food to keep their children alive.  If only some of that money wasted on
proving the immorality of the president of a nation without morals could
have been spent feeding the starved, clothing the naked and restoring human
rights in those places where they are so desperately lacking.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Dov's Peace</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ruth Anderson</B></CENTER></P>

<P>My name is Dov.  I am an 18-year-old Israeli soldier out to defend my
country.  My country and my parents taught me about all the past battles
the Jewish people fought and how, throughout the ages, they have been victims
of discrimination and injustice.  I can see the river of blood that my forebears
have bled in the struggle for their very existence.<BR>
The Israeli army has conditioned me to be a machine, and I have been stripped
of my humanity.  I have sworn allegiance to protect and defend my country
against all odds and I have, along the line of military duty, lost my conscience.
 I am a robot wearing a steel helmet, bearing ammunition to kill any enemy
(including women and children), and wielding a club to crush all Palestinian
bones.<BR>
I would like to tell you about the clubs the IDF (Israeli Defense Force)
dispenses to its soldiers.  The clubs are made of three sections, the handles,
the staffs and the heads.  The first blow I made with such a club was to
the shoulder of a Palestinian woman.  I was terrified and closed my eyes
and prayed in my heart that she wouldn't feel the blow, that its force would
dissipate and that I would cause no harm.  I learned the terminology of
the kinds of blows delivered: halting blows, direct blows and fracturing
blows-all of which come under the category of &quot;reasonable blows.&quot;<BR>
After much painstaking training, I achieved the required expertise needed
to deliver the blow that breaks everything; the club is raised in a circular
motion, and for the proper impact, two-thirds a length's distance is required,
which is reasonable force.<BR>
At a refugee camp in the Gaza Strip where I am presently stationed, there
is a curfew.  Everything is desolate and no one is moving except my fellow
Israeli soldiers and dogs.  Under my helmet of steel, I can feel the summer
heat and my body is heavy with sweat and the live ammunition I carry daily
to combat those people who try to defend what is left of Palestine.  I have
been programmed to think that the Palestinians I confront are dogs and do
not deserve to live and that it is up to soldiers like me to make life as
miserable as possible for them so they will evacuate their homes so more
Jews like me can invade the area.<BR>
Under the heat of the night and the beads of sweat that drip like a leaky
faucet under my steel helmet, I spot a small boy crossing the road.  He
might remind you of your own child were he human.  The boy starts to run.
 A curfew is a curfew and an order is an order.  Beatings have become a
routine, but here in the refugee camp, of all places, my conscience begins
to stir.  It whispers to me, &quot;A child is a child&quot; in spite of
the fact that he's instigating a war with his little fists and in spite
of the fact that I have been conditioned to believe that he is a little
&quot;bastard.&quot;  He's still a child.  My destructive awareness, the
fruit of years of humanistic education of many years standing, comes to
his defense.  It encircles the club I am wielding and tries with all its
might to preserve itself.  But I'm a soldier; I'm obedient.  I raise the
club and with expert blows employing &quot;reasonable force&quot; beat my
awareness to a pulp.<BR>
My conscientiousness has been crushed and suddenly I discover that it is
I who am an animal and not a human being and as I recall what happened to
the Jews 55 years ago, I stand there in my bloodied uniform and my steel
helmet, with my club, my gun and my ammunition-but no conscience-as they
load what remains of the little boy and take him to a hospital and the curfew
returns to normal.  The river of blood that now flows in a world of injustice
and discrimination is no longer Jewish but Palestinian.</P>
