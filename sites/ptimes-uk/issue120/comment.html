<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">The Dishonest Broker </font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the mid-1970s, the Palestinian scholar and historian Walid al-Khalidi
labelled the United States &#147;the tormentor of the Palestinian people,&#148; a true
description reflecting flagrant American backing of the apartheid Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unfortunately, this characterization is much truer today than it was then.
The U.S. remains the main guarantor and sustainer of Israeli State-sponsored terrorism
against the defenceless Palestinian people whose sole &#147;crime&#148; is their enduring
yearning for freedom from an incomparably evil military occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The U.S. continues to be the financier of Israeli military aggrandizement
and defender of Zionist aggression against Arab countries at the United Nations Security
Council and around the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This brazenly shameless attitude makes the U.S. the main obstacle impeding
the implementation of UN resolutions in the Middle East. In the final analysis, the U.S.
is effectively the main obstacle to reaching an equitable and lasting peace in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light, it is ludicrous and preposterous to continue to treat the U.S.
as &#147;the honest broker&#148; between the oppressed Palestinians and their Zionist
tormentors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, viewing the U.S., or expecting it to be honest, fair and impartial
in the efforts to find a peaceful settlement for the Israeli-Palestinian strife, reflects
an astounding degree of ignorance of the way the U.S. conducts its policy toward Israel
and the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How can a thief, who is also a murderer, be trusted to make justice
prevail?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Islam, believers are exhorted not to be bitten from the same
(snake&#146;s) hole twice. However, the Palestinian Authority and Palestinians in general
have been bitten many times by the venomous American viper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America&#146;s murderous perfidy hit the Palestinian people so many times,
each harder than the previous one.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1982, the U.S. promised Arafat and Lebanon&#146;s then-Prime Minister
Shafik al-Wazzan that Sharon&#146;s invading forces wouldn&#146;t attack the defenceless
Palestinian refugees following the evacuation of PLO forces from Beirut, and the result,
as we all know too well, was the genocidal massacre at the Sabra and Shatilla refugee
camps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Reagan administration was so brazen then that it didn&#146;t even
apologize to the Palestinian people for its criminal connivance with the Zionist entity, a
connivance that was more or less responsible for the mass annihilation of thousands of
men, women and children who were counting in vain on &#147;the world&#146;s leading
democracy&#148; to save them from Begin and Sharon, the Hitlers and Himmlers of the
post-Second World War.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now there is a new tragic joke in town; it is the so-called Mitchell
committee report&#151;a miserable document exuding profound ignorance, bias and unfair
judgement on the part of its authors. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Equating the aggressor with the aggressed-upon, the hapless report calls
on PA leader Yasser Arafat to &#147;take every conceivable effort to combat violence and
terror and to tell the Palestinians in unmistakable terms that terror is
unacceptable.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So Palestinian resistance is referred to as &#147;terror&#148; while the
murderous Zionist rampage against unprotected Palestinian towns, villages and hamlets,
along with the use of tanks, helicopter gun-ships and F-16 fighter bombers, is legitimate
self-defence!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Can one think of a more scandalous and blatant misrepresentation of truth?
What happened to people&#146;s sense of justice and simple fairness? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This brazen incrimination of Palestinian struggle for freedom and
liberation should raise a million questions about the wisdom of counting on the U.S.
administration, which officially espoused the report, to restart the so-called &#147;peace
process.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout the &#147;Oslo years,&#148; the Palestinian Authority,
especially its autocratic President Yasser Arafat, trusted the U.S. too much despite
earnest advice to the contrary by many sound-minded Palestinian and Arab intellectuals and
politicians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Arafat is always his own false god. He nearly jumped out of his skin
to embrace the American role to the point of repugnance and impropriety, and on many
occasions he did not hesitate to make vacuous remarks such as saying, &#147;We have a
friend at the White House,&#148; the same friend that hectored Arafat to forget the
paramount Right of Return and much of al-Quds al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, Arafat and company are advised, indeed warned, not to repeat the same
mistakes. The Palestinian people must not allow them to do so, because the blood of the
500 martyrs&#151;among them Muhammed Durra and Iman Hijjo&#151;and that of the estimated
25,000 Palestinians injured so far must not be allowed to be the subject of cheap
bargaining with the conspiring Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, it is inconceivable that the Zionist criminals will agree to
freeze Jewish settlement building in the West Bank and in Gaza. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A government made up of the likes of Sharon, Liberman, Zevi, Levi, and
other fascist and racist murderers will not agree to halt settlement building, and the
Bush administration will not dare put up a fight with the Zionist-dominated Congress and
the terrorizing Jewish lobby, and will likely opt to remain on the safe side.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Taking this into account, the Palestinian Authority must not allow itself
to be beguiled, once again, into sacrificing the intifada&#151;probably the
Palestinians&#146; last remaining hope for freedom from Jewish apartheid and
occupation&#151;in return for some vague and disingenuous promises from a White House that
sees the world through Zionist glasses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, the &#147;golden days&#148; of Oslo are over, and the
Palestinian people will not be duped again by the conspiratorial illusions of the U.S. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian people shall not be bitten from the same hole again, and
be it as it may.</p>
