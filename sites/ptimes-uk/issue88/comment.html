<H3><CENTER>What about Jewish terrorism?</CENTER></H3>

<P>The recent diabolical murder by Zionists of two Islamist fighters
(the brothers Imad and Adel Awadallah), along with the cold-blooded
killing of a Betunya schoolboy, Iyad Karabseh, once again illustrates
the brutal ugliness of the Jewish Zionist mentality.<BR>
In the case of the Awadallah brothers, the Israeli army not only
brutally murder the two Palestinian brothers while in Israeli
custody (some say by injecting them with a lethal chemical substance
similar to that used by the Mossad on Hamas Leader Khalid Misha'al
last year), but went as far as dumping their bodies in some isolated
valley and refusing to hand them over to their families for a
proper burial according to Islamic practices.<BR>
In the case of Karabseh, as usual, the Zionist establishment added
insult to injury. The settler, a cloned Jewish brand of the Nazi
SS, chased a group of schoolchildren who were returning home,
stopping once in a while to reload his gun and firing at the poor
creatures.<BR>
According to eyewitnesses, the criminal settler was laughing hysterically
as he opened fire on the little boys and girls, who were fleeing
for their lives, wondering how and why a human being could ever
seek to kill little children returning home from school.<BR>
But that was not all.<BR>
The Zionist &quot;court&quot; before which the criminal settler
appeared ruled that &quot;he did nothing wrong&quot; and that
he &quot;acted in sheer self-defense&quot;.<BR>
Moreover, the presiding &quot;judge&quot; actually lauded the
settler, describing him as &quot;an exemplary citizen.&quot;<BR>
Of course, this is not the first time Zionist Jews behaved like
this. In fact, the entire Zionist history, at least since the
establishment of the malignant Zionist entity called Israel, has
been a huge accumulative criminal file.  Zionist leaders from
Ben Gurion to Netanyahu inaugurated their professional life with
murder and ended it with murder.<BR>
So, &quot;murder from the cradle to the grave&quot; is par excellence
the Zionist slogan and way of life.<BR>
In the face of this haunting terrorism, perpetrated by an evil
entity intent on destroying the Palestinians and usurping the
remainder of their country, what should Arabs and Muslims do?<BR>
It is no secret that the Zionist entity thrives on American support.
America is Israel's bloodline; without America, Israel will lose
its ability to survive. Arabs and Muslims everywhere must, for
the sake of restoring their usurped dignity and freedom, convey
a message, active rather than passive, that its political, economic
and strategic interests along the length and breadth of the Muslim
world are not safe.<BR>
The masses should not-must not-wait until the impotent rulers
change their ways, for this will not happen in a hundred years
to come. It is we, the masses, who must wake up and restore, by
force if necessary, our arrogated rights from these little despots,
the puppets of Zionism and American imperialism.<BR>
These despots are protected, and largely sustained, by the rapacious
Uncle Sam, who is interested in cheap oil more than democracy.<BR>
Nobody pretends that this is not going to be costly. Freedom needs
sacrifices. But the price we are paying for not paying the dues
of freedom is a hundred-fold.<BR>
This means the choice is ours. Either we continue to pay the price
of humiliation and enslavement, or rise up to challenge those
who torment and enslave us.<BR>
Undermining and endangering America's interests need not assume
a violent form. American goods should be boycotted in favour of,
say, European goods.<BR>
The imperative matter is that we must show them that we mean it
this time, otherwise they will continue to treat us, as they have
been, as sub-humans who can be controlled vicariously, through
controlling our despotic rulers.<BR>
The White House enslaves our rulers, and our leaders enslave us.
This vicious circle must be broken as soon as possible if we truly
aspire for freedom and a better tomorrow.<BR>
Let us not wait any more, for if we do, the Zionists will humiliate
us further, and we, the masses, will bear the brunt because our
leaders are insensitive.<BR>
