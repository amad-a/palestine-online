<P><CENTER><B>By Mahmoud al Khatib</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Not only do the Palestinians reject the Oslo accords, but also
the Israelis are not satisfied with the contents of the agreement
officially signed in Washington five years ago. It is ironic that
although 60% of Israelis support the peace process, according
to polls conducted by Tel Aviv University's Tami Steinmatz Institute
of Peace, they do not want to abide by the provisions of the Oslo
agreement. They do not want a Palestinian State built on the Palestinian
territories (two thirds of Israelis reject it). They are even
bargaining over the withdrawal from 13% of the West Bank. <BR>
What do the Israelis want exactly? They want a peace like the
one wanted by their Prime Minister Netanyahu, which takes but
does not give. Even when the thing they are requested to give
is something they have already stolen from the Palestinians.<BR>
The Israelis are sensitive towards any kind of pressure exerted
over them to give some &quot;relinquishments&quot; to their partners,
the real owners of the land. They become very wild in their behaviour
when one of their allies tries to convince them to carry out their
commitments as stipulated in the peace agreement with the Palestinians.
They are ready to take Monica's stained dress out of storage after
three years in order to destroy and humiliate the poor Clinton,
who thought Netanyahu went too far in challenging the World's
will. I wonder if there is any woman in the world who keeps a
man's dirt on her dress as a &quot;souvenir&quot; unless it was
an intentional act of malice. Now we discover that this Monica
is a Zionist Likud fanatic.<BR>
Israelis have been drifting to the &quot;wrong&quot; Right since
1977 when the Likud, led by Menachem Begin, won its first elections.
Although the Israeli Right has formed a total of six Israeli governments
out of the 27 governments formed since the establishment of the
Jewish State, all of these six governments were formed in the
last two decades. Isn't it strange that an international terrorist
like Begin signs a peace accord with the Egyptians while his mate
Yitzhak Shamir, another international terrorist, turned into a
dove by accepting to start peace talks with the other Arab parties,
including the PLO? But what kind of peace do these Zionist Rightists
want? It is a unique peace that is only known by the majority
in Israel, the Rightists.</P>

<P><B>Interview with Khalid Misha'al<BR>
Chief of the Hamas Political Bureau</B></P>

<H3><CENTER>Misha'al: Hamas Rejects Violence Against Foreign Embassies;
<BR>
Capable Of Resisting The Occupation</CENTER></H3>

<P><I> The Chief of the Hamas Political Bureau, Khalid Misha'al,
asserted that his movement does not believe in violence directed
against foreign embassies. However, he held the United States
responsible for these acts of violence. Mr. Misha'al, who escaped
an Israeli attempt on his life in September last year, said Hamas
is convinced of keeping the battle against the Zionist Occupation
in Palestine although it is still possible to transfer the battle
elsewhere.</I></P>

<P><B>Following are excerpts of an interview conducted by Khalid
Al-Hroub and published first in Al-Quds Al-Arabi, London, 10 September
1998. It is translated by Dr. Azzam Tamimi.</B></P>

<P><B>Question: How do you view the bombings of the U.S. embassies
in Nairobi and Dar Salam?</B></P>

<P><B>Answer: </B>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) does
not believe in the [act of] violence that is directed against
foreign embassies. However, we do believe that the U.S. policy,
which is unjust and biased against the Arabs, the Muslims and
other freedom-seeking peoples in the world, provides the right
environment for such actions, and thus is to be held responsible
for them. </P>

<P><B>Q: In the light of the [bungled assassination] attempt on
your life, has there been a change in Hamas' strategy with regard
to transferring the battle outside Palestine? That is, bearing
in mind that in the wake of the assassination of Muhyiddin Ash-Sharif,
Al-Qassam Brigades (Hamas' military wing), issued a statement
in which it threatened to execute military operations against
Zionist targets all over the world.</B></P>

<P><B>A: </B>The arena of conflict between us and the Zionist
Occupation [regime] is occupied Palestine. Hamas is still adhering
to its policy of restricting the conflict to occupied Palestine.
This is our legitimate right in light of the oppression and persecution
our people are being subjected to. In our view, the Israeli transgression
of transferring the battle to [areas] outside Palestine-through
the extension of aggression to wider sectors of our people and
their leaders and through the violation of the sovereignty and
security of Arab and foreign countries-is a sign of weakness,
not strength. The Occupation's failure to repress the resistance
[of our people] inside Palestine has driven it to transfer [the
battle] to the outside [of Palestine].  Hamas is not so weak as
to resort to transferring the battle elsewhere. Hamas still has
confidence in its people and in itself, and is still capable of
resisting the occupation. It is also capable of developing the
tools of resistance, especially that it emanates from just and
legitimate foundations. However, I would like to point out that
Hamas may indeed be able to restrain itself, its followers and
recruits in accordance with the policy it believes in and commits
itself to pursuing, but it does not have the means of controlling
[spontaneous] popular reactions that may ensue, develop and express
themselves in any other language should Israel persist in its
aggression [against the Palestinian people] in all directions
and in all arenas without any regard for international law, United
Nations resolutions or criticism from the international community.
If the world truly believes in justice and human rights, and if
it recognizes the right of oppressed and persecuted peoples [to
struggle for freedom], it is responsible for putting an end to
Israeli crimes. So long as such crimes continue to be committed,
no one can restrain the Arab and Muslim people's reactions.  </P>

<P><B>Q: Many observers frequently raise questions about what
Hamas expects to come of its military operations: does Hamas want
to liberate Palestine based on erratic campaigns, and does it
truly believe that this methodology will achieve its objectives?
And what exactly are the objectives and strategies of Hamas, especially
since many observers see these military operations as a hindrance
to the peace process that in turn hurts the Palestinian people
and their cause?</B></P>

<P><B>A:</B> First of all, resistance must be placed within the
context of legitimate rights, and then discuss the objective.
Because without placing it in this context, its role in the struggle
of many peoples throughout history is dwarfed. Furthermore, it
is only logical that a people oppressed have a legitimate right
to rise against their subjugators; this is a right that peoples
of the East and West, in the past and in modern times, in Europe
and America, have exercised. Therefore it is neither acceptable
nor reasonable that the right of the Palestinian people to pursue
what is expected of them be confiscated, particularly given that
the roots of, and the reasons for, the resistance are significant,
continue to exist and, in fact, have increased. The resistance
of the Palestinian people is exercised within this context. Therefore,
the objective of these military operations is to eliminate oppression-no
more, no less. For the Palestinian people have been subjected
to suppression, and the resistance seeks to remove this injustice;
liberate the land and the people, and guarantee the Palestinian
people's right of return. It neither makes sense nor is it just
that millions of Jews emigrate from all corners of the globe to
Palestine, yet the indigenous population that were forcibly expelled
and live in exile or in camps cannot return to their homeland.
Questions raised here should revolve around the larger challenges,
around the imbalance of power in the region, around the lack of
parity between the Israelis on the one hand and the Arab Palestinian
side on the other, and about the ability of the resistance to
succeed in achieving its objective. Hence the question [of whether
military operations achieve Hamas' goals] may be valid, but it
does not preclude resistance as an effectual option to attain
the objective. And discussion of this idea can be approached from
a number of angles.</P>

<P><B>First,</B> history tells of no alternative to resistance
that forces an oppressive occupying power to withdraw and let
go of its occupation and violation of the lands of others. The
use of entreaties and pleas achieves no ends or liberty, nor does
it return usurped land; so why do they want the Palestinian people
to be an experiment for defective options that perhaps no other
people in the world would consider?</P>

<P><B>Second</B>, the language of the dominating force in the
20th century has proven that the only language it understands
and affects its decisions and directions is the language of counter-force,
even if the two parties are not of the same strength. And here,
the strength of the people need not necessarily be equal to the
strength of the occupier. </P>

<P><B>Third</B>, the other option, namely that of (a peaceful)
settlement, has been tried, especially after Madrid and Oslo.
 This route has proven to be a total failure. The settlement,
and what it has entailed of concessions, has not restored any
of the fundamental rights of the Palestinians. The settlement
has not persuaded the Zionist entity to make any significant concessions,
nor has it prompted the sponsoring powers, especially the United
States, to get involved and at the very least try to implement
the agreements, despite their feebleness, that the parties to
the settlement had agreed upon. </P>

<P>What we see of negotiations and meetings proves that this process
has turned into a futile exercise because of the imbalance of
power: one party pleads, and the other dictates. Therefore, our
conviction in Hamas is that the option of resistance is a legitimate
right, and it is the only effective, useful route to achieving
the objective, even if the path to victory takes a long time.
Yet it is not true to say that the choice of resistance hinders
a just settlement currently available because there is no just
settlement put forward at this time. Nor do I believe that there
is another solution that can be attained without resistance.</P>

<P><B>Q: Let's move on to another issue, namely Hamas' international
relations. Hamas continues to be, clearly, lacking in its international
relations. While maintaining some good relations at the Arab level,
there is no indication that Hamas is making any effort or pursuing
any activity at the international level, whether in the West (that
is Europe and the United States), in Asia, or in other regions.
What is Hamas' strategy in this regard, and what is the cause
of this weakness?</B></P>

<P><B>A:</B> I would like first to point out that we have no problem
with any regional or international party. Our problem lies exclusively
with the Zionist Occupation in Palestine. Even the United States
of America, despite its complete bias toward Israel, is not considered
to be at war with us.  Our movement keeps all channels open. We
address the entire world based on the just cause we defend and
the fundamental right we possess. Hence, Hamas emanates from an
anxiousness to communicate to the rest of the world the justness
of our cause. Secondly, I would like to stress that Hamas exercises
resistance against occupation and practices politics and what
that entails of international relations in the widest possible
way. Hamas is a moderate movement in terms of its rationale, its
ideology, its position and its comprehension of the factors and
circumstances that determine regional and international conditions.
Thus, in Hamas we believe that what adversely affects the building
of international relations is not Hamas itself but rather the
other parties. Hence, at the level of Arab relations, some parties
were hesitant, but with time Hamas has become widely acceptable
in both the Arab and Islamic regions. </P>

<P><B>Q: Hamas says that it carries a national project that encompasses
all individuals and sectors within the Palestinian community,
and that aims at achieving their objectives. However, its discourse
seems to be restricted to the Muslims in Palestine. Where are
the Christians in Hamas' reckoning?</B></P>

<P><B>A: </B>Yes, Hamas carries an all-encompassing project for
all the Palestinian people. Hamas is aware of its responsibility
toward all the concerns of the Palestinian people, both Muslims
and Christians, in all segments of society, and wherever they
happen to be located, whether in the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
or in the 1948-occupied territories, or outside Palestine. Some
within the PLO have attempted in the past to cast doubt on the
Hamas position vis-&agrave;-vis the Palestinian Christians. They
even tried to obstruct Hamas' interaction with the Christians.
However, it has been proven during the years of the intifadah,
as well as through political dealings and field interactions,
that there was never a problem in Hamas' dealings with the Christian
sector of our people. There is evidence in numerous stances known
to everyone inside and outside Palestine. I would like to stress
that no obstacle, or tension, exists within Hamas regarding the
Christians. After all, they too are our people, and they share
with us the responsibility and the suffering. Hamas' programme
and national project do not exclude our people's Christians in
any way, just as they do not exclude the various elements of the
Palestinian spectrum from the right to the left, including the
forging of alliances and pacts with the ten Palestinian factions
and various other Palestinian groups.</P>

<P>As for the mechanisms of inclusion, which some have been asking
about, I believe that the Hamas project, which is developing and
progressing, and the advancement in its organizational structures,
will one day be capable of translating the movement's convictions
in this matter into a practical formula. Hamas is a horizontally
and vertically deep-rooted organization that expresses the hopes
and aspirations of the Palestinian people wherever they may be
living. Such a well-placed, deep-rooted, organization, whose programme
and project are founded on credibility and adherence to the option
of resistance, is here to remain. Hamas, together with other Palestinian
political forces, contributes-perhaps more than anyone else does-to
outlining the Palestinian future. Those who insist on dealing
with this cause both at present and in the future, while ignoring
Hamas, are in fact missing the future option. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Fifth anniversary of Oslo</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Despite the continued impasse in the peace process, the Palestinian
Authority switched into a celebration mode in the third week of
August to mark the fifth anniversary of the achievement of the
Oslo peace accords with the Israelis. <BR>
A high-level delegation led by Palestinian Authority (PA) chief
Yasser Arafat travelled to Oslo where the anniversary was celebrated
in the presence of a much-less senior Israeli delegation (since
Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu declined), as well as representatives
of the American and Norwegian governments. On the occasion, U.S.
President Clinton sent a congratulatory message to the party assuring
that every member of his administration was determined to push
through its recommended 13% Israeli troop withdrawal from the
West Bank. Netanyahu's contribution was an offer of a 13% withdrawal
wrapped in a list of conditions. <BR>
The first and most important condition stipulates that at least
3% of the recommended territory to be handed to the Palestinians
be declared a natural reservation, thus leaving the Palestinians
with only 10% of the land to control. This in fact is what Netanyahu
had always insisted on permitting the Palestinians to take control
of in a prelude to entering the long-awaited final stage negotiations.
The other conditions deal primarily with security arrangements.
The Palestinian Authority was called upon to enhance its role
in curbing 'terrorism' and to embark on destroying the infrastructures
of organizations such as Hamas and Islamic Jihad. Although Yasser
Arafat pretended to adopt a reserved position, he expressed readiness
to meet the Israeli Prime Minister and authorized a meeting between
CIA representatives and PA security chiefs to discuss ways and
means of curbing 'terrorism' against Israel. </P>

<P>However, both the Israelis and their Palestinian 'peace' partners
know that 'terrorism' is not something the PA can single-handedly
deal with. The 40,000-strong PA police force has indeed succeeded
in markedly reducing attacks on Israeli targets, but only if they
originate in the territory under direct PA control. Security coordination
and intelligence exchanges between the two sides have made a big
difference. Nevertheless, there is a limit to what the PA can
do in areas where it has no jurisdiction, especially given that
friction between Jewish settlers and Arabs is present almost on
a daily basis. Take, for instance, the case of Al-Khalil, the
city of Hebron.  The centre of this Palestinian city continues,
despite the peace process, to be occupied by a minute number of
Jewish settlers guarded around the clock by concentrations of
Israeli troops. Since the signing of the Oslo agreement in September
1993, the Israelis have withdrawn from most Palestinian population
centres in the West Bank and Gaza. The only exception has been
Hebron, which Muslims believe to be the abode of the Father of
Prophets, Ibrahim Al-Khalil.  Jewish settlers also claim a right
to this ancient town. Some even consider it more sacred than Jerusalem.
Not surprisingly, settlement projects inside the city and around
it started soon after the Israelis invaded it in the aftermath
of the six-day war in June 1967. In addition to three major settlement
towns on the outskirts of the city, at least four settlements
exist in the heart of the city. One of these is a portable-house
compound set up on a hill known as Tal-Rumaideh, right in the
middle of a Palestinian residential district.  Just two days before
the PA celebrated its fifth birthday, an assailant, believed by
the Israelis to be Arab, sneaked into one of the settlement's
portable houses and stabbed its Jewish occupier-a Rabbi-to death
and set the his prefab house on fire before fleeing the scene.</P>

<P>Some Palestinians cast doubt on the Israeli allegation that
the assailant was an Arab. They argue that this particular settlement
is well guarded, well lit and is monitored around the clock. According
to Palestinians living in the neighbourhood, not even a cat can
sneak unnoticed into the compound.  The theory these sceptics
come up with is that the Israeli Government, or one of the Jewish
settlement agencies sponsored by it, had been waiting for such
a 'golden opportunity' to convert what hitherto had been a temporary
and illegal settlement into a government-sponsored and fully recognized
permanent settlement. Evidently, as soon as the news of the attack
reached Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu, he announced the conversion
and authorized the necessary measures to grant permanent status
to the said settlement. This would have to mean that a fellow
Jew killed the Rabbi. Although it is not unprecedented that Zionists
kill Jews to achieve a given objective, some Palestinians believe
it is highly unlikely that a Jew killed this Rabbi.  They argue
that not a single attack against an Israeli or Jewish target in
the territories goes unpunished. The Israelis have always exploited
attacks in order to reinforce or expand settlement projects, or
to inflict collective punishment on the Palestinians thus undermining
their economic power and weakening their resolve to resist occupation,
or to demand more concessions from the PA, or even to request
further U.S. aid. It is further argued that the very presence
of Jewish settlers in the midst of Palestinians within Hebron
is a source of provocation. There will always be those who might
be tempted to seize every available opportunity to punish these
Jewish invaders who sneaked into town, expropriated land and set
up houses under the watch and protection of Israeli occupation
troops. </P>

<P>If it turns out that an Arab had indeed been responsible for
killing the Rabbi, this would be one of the most daring operations
against a Jewish settler in the city since the occupation began.
For the operation to succeed, and for the assailant to be able
to escape unharmed, the operation would have required meticulous
planning and top secrecy. Most probably, the assailant plotted
and executed alone. Thanks to the efforts of the PA, the Palestinian
community is infiltrated with informers like never before. Therefore,
the success of daring and effective attacks requires strict secrecy.
The failure of any established organization to claim responsibility
for the attack reinforces the suspicion that this might have been
an individual initiative. However, one must not rule out the possibility
that not claiming responsibility may represent a change in strategy
on the part of Palestinian militant organizations to avert retaliation
by either or both the PA and Israel. </P>

<P>The recent incident in Hebron proves beyond a doubt that in
spite of celebrating the fifth anniversary of the conclusion of
'peace' between the PLO and Israel, peace has failed to establish
roots. Palestinians continue to regard Israelis, and particularly
Jewish settlers, to be foreign invaders and illegitimate occupiers.
At the same time Israel continues to behave as a foreign occupation
power. Whatever security measures are adopted, notwithstanding
coordination and cooperation among agents of the CIA, the Mossad
and various PA intelligence agencies to curb violence or 'terrorism',
Jewish settlers continue to be vulnerable and security for Israelis
inside the occupied territories will always be scarce.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Sabra &amp; Shatila 16 years later</CENTER></H3>

<P><B><I>The Lebanese Daily Star, 16 September 1998<BR>
</I></B><I>Sixteen years ago today, refugees at Sabra and Chatila
woke up to one of the bloodiest chapters in Lebanon's history.
Militiamen had stormed the shanty-towns in Beirut's southern suburbs,
slaughtering hundreds of civilians in a rampage that would shock
the world. Today, few of those who survived remain in the camp.
Those who could leave the country have done so. Those who couldn't
afford to get out, live in daily reminder of the horrific massacre.
The Daily Star's Reem Haddad has been talking to some of the survivors.</I></P>

<P><B>A Lesson in Hatred<BR>
Mohammed Srour, 35, can never forgive himself for leaving his
family behind: </B><BR>
&quot;It was Thursday at 5.45pm precisely. I was sitting on the
roof and saw soldiers running in. Their caps were turned to the
back. I knew they were attacking the camp. I told my father. He
immediately gave me and my brother money and told us to run away.
He and my mother and sisters would stay at home. He thought the
soldiers would only want the young men. So we ran. I came back
on Saturday when the Lebanese army came in. I opened the door.
My father's and sister's bodies were crumpled on top of each other.
Outside on the streets were piles of bodies, with flies sticking
to them. I recognized some of our neighbors. The massacre taught
me one thing-hatred. Hatred against the Jews and those who were
with them.&quot;</P>

<P><B>I Pretended to be Dead<BR>
Nohad Srour, 35, Mohammed's sister, has recurring nightmares and
clearly sees one killers' face in her head.</B><BR>
&quot;After my brothers ran off to hide, we went to bed. We never
thought they'd come for us. I had two sisters and two younger
brothers. I was 16 years old. At 5.40 in the morning, the door
was kicked in and soldiers ran into our house. They dragged us
out of bed and ordered us to stand against the wall. I carried
my little sister and saw my two little brothers sneak off to the
bathroom. We were scared. My parents and sisters were screaming.
I couldn't scream. I don't know why . One man had his gun pointed
at us but he couldn't get himself to shoot. Another soldier said
in Arabic: &quot;shoot, what are you waiting for?&quot; but the
man wouldn't. The other one grabbed the gun and told my father
to show him his papers. As my father turned to get the papers,
the soldiers shot hi then turned the gun on us and kept shooting.
I was carrying my one-year-old baby sister and she was yelling
'Mama! Mama!' then suddenly nothing. I looked at her<BR>
and her brain had fallen out her head and down my arm. I looked
around and saw that my mother and my older sister were still alive
but wounded.<BR>
My mother and I could walk but my sister couldn't. We had to leave
her lying in blood. I put a jug of water next to her and we ran
to get help. For three days she stayed there lying with the corpses.<BR>
My two little brothers ran off from the bathroom and we found
them later. My sister's still alive but she is paralyzed.&quot;</P>

<P><B>LL 12,000 to spare a son's life<BR>
Um Ghazi Younes, 55- eleven members of her family were killed.
</B><BR>
&quot;My daughter had been killed 40 days before in an Israeli
bombardment.&quot;<BR>
Relatives had come from Tyre and Sidon for her 40th remembrance.<BR>
&quot;We were more than 25 people. When the soldiers surrounded
the house, we hid the men at one end and the women went out to
meet the soldiers. We told them we were all women there. But the
soldiers barged in and found the men. They ordered the women out
and left the men inside. I had four teenage sons and a little
girl. My youngest boy was 11 and came to me. The soldier ordered
him to go in with the men. I said he was a girl. His hair was
long and they believed me. I said 'her' name was Hamdeh. &quot;Hamdeh&quot;
was carrying her baby cousin but tripped and fell. When his sister
came to help him, she called him by his real name and the soldier
knew it was a<BR>
boy. He cursed us and hit us. He grabbed the boy. I cried and
pleaded. I had LL12,000 in my dress. In those days, it was a lot
of money. I told him I'd give it to him if he would let my son
go.<BR>
He agreed and took us to the Sports City. There were a lot of
women and children there. We had to sit in a huge hole. They said
they were going to bury us. We ran off when soldiers went to investigate
some explosions.<BR>
I ran home and found my husband and children dead. Mohammed was
the youngest at 14. They had burned his body with acid. They chopped
up the others with a hatchet. I found my husband's head on the
pillow.&quot;</P>

<P><B>My life ended that day<BR>
Mohammed Abu Rodaina, 21, carries a picture in his wallet showing
his father and uncles slain outside their home.</B><BR>
&quot;I was five years old at the time of the massacre but I remember
every detail. We heard shelling and shots but my father didn't
think it was anything serious.<BR>
We joined my uncle's family downstairs and played cards and laughed.
We were 15 altogether. Suddenly, a woman barged in on us. She
had blood all over. She screamed that there was a massacre taking
place. My father didn't believe her. He told her to stop saying
things like that because it would scare the children.<BR>
But then we heard screams. We all ran into a small room to hide.
It was tiny and we could barely breathe. Our old neighbor went
outside to see what was happening. He was shot. His daughter followed
him and she was shot. My parents told us to be quiet so the soldiers
wouldn't hear us. We tried but we children couldn't help crying.
One baby kept wailing. <BR>
The soldiers heard and found us. They ran in and started breaking
up everything.  Then they grouped us- the men on one side and
the women and children on the other.<BR>
They marched the women and children out. Just outside the camp,
an Israeli soldier grabbed me and gave me a biscuit. He asked
me what my father was wearing. I knew he wanted to know whether
my father was fighter. I didn't say anything.<BR>
The soldiers then took us to the Sports City. They said they were
going to kill us. Suddenly, some explosions happened nearby and
they ran off.  One of the women suddenly yelled for us to run.
And we did. Later we went back to the camp. My father and uncles
had been killed.<BR>
We found my sisters found my sisters who were married and lived
elsewhere in the camp also dead. <BR>
Until this day, I still question how my father, having seen the
women covered in blood, did not believe her instantly. Maybe things
would have turned out different. I desperately needed my father
all my life. My mother died a few years later. She never got over
what she'd seen. That left me and my sister, alone all these years.
My life ended that day. Now, I just exist. I hate my life. I hate
myself. I just want to leave this<BR>
camp, this country. I want to start somewhere else. But I'm only
a Palestinian. Who would help me?&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>A hungry revolution</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Abu al Tayeb</B></CENTER></P>

<P>The heat wave kept me away from the field, but my house was
boiling hot, too, and the faucet had gone dry. I decided to go
to my friend Abu Salem and see how he was managing. I told you
about Abu Salem a few times. He is very wise and teaches me a
lot. Abu Salem is younger than I am, but he finished high school
and I only went up to elementary. Fortunately, he was in a contemplative
mood, so we sat in front of his fan.<BR>
I asked him what he thought of Clinton and the stained dress.
&quot;Oh&quot;, he said &quot;corruption is everywhere-it just
changes its face from country to country. Look at the Italian
corruption. It's frightening because it's always connected to
those families of the Mafia in Sicily and you can never know what
they will do.  The American and &yacute;British corruption is
nicer because it's romantic, like the romance between the President
and his young assistant. The Israeli corruption, on the other
hand, is of the racist type; you know, only the Jews benefit.&quot;<BR>
And what about the Palestinian type? I asked. &quot;Palestinian
what?&quot; he asked. Well, Palestinian corruption, I answered.
Everyone is talking about it!<BR>
&quot;The Palestinian people have no corruption&quot;, said Abu
Salem decisively.<BR>
How's that? Where are the $300 million that disappeared from our
budget? You know, the money our new friends from Europe gave us.
<BR>
&quot;Our revolution ate them.&quot;<BR>
Revolution?<BR>
&quot;Yes, my dear friend. Our revolution is a hungry one. Always
was. Why do you ask about the $300 million and leave out the Sumud
money that our brothers working in the oil countries sent us so
that we could hold on here? That was a long, long time ago, I
admit-you have to go back to the age of the glorious intifadah
and even before that. You've probably forgotten how all that cash
sank in the sea between Tunis and us. Our revolution was always
losing millions of dollars here and there, that's why it's called
'the revolution of the millions'.&quot;<BR>
Like the Algerian one!<BR>
B&yacute;ut that was called the Revolution of the Million Martyrs!
 I corrected him. <BR>
&quot;One word less, one more, what does it matter&quot;, said
Abu Salem. &quot;So we are famous because the leaders of our great
revolution are millionaires. Don't look down on millions&quot;,
he scolded me. &quot;While we were fighting here against the Israelis,
our leaders out there were scratching their nails off for new
wells of money. So when the well of the Gulf dried up, they very
cleverly found a new one in Europe and that's how we reached our
historical deal with the Zionists. And that's how we will finally
reach our independent State. All those who don't like it can 'go
drink the water of Gaza'. As our great president likes to say,
'Did any of them turn down money? Did any of them refuse to pose
with our leader with the picture of the holy al Aqsa in holy Jerusalem
behind them?' &quot;<BR>
Abu Salem paused to calm himself. Then he rolled his head from
side to side, with a gentle smile that always makes me like him.
&quot;This is not corruption, my friend. This is building a State.
When he made his new Government the other day, our great president
did not remove a single minister. Isn't that something? Doesn't
that speak well for them? Instead he added ten more. Our State
is growing. At this rate, we'll all be ministers. We'll all get
to pose with him beneath the picture of holy Jerusalem, and we'll
all get the money from Europe, and if we all get it, that's democracy.&quot;<BR>
&quot;You just have to have faith in our president. You know,
he really thought about those appointments. For 12 whole months
he gathered around him the wisest he could-don't worry, Abu Tayeb,
your turn will come. For 12 whole months they broke their heads,
and don't think they didn't read the Corruption Reports!  No,
they pored over them, looking for signs of wrong-doing. All they
could find was a State in the making. Our president took those
Reports so much to heart, and he was so encouraged by them, he
recites them constantly. You can see it on his lips. The effect
is not the result of some illness or drug-no, he is tallying up
the figures, my friend. He is constantly tallying to make sure
we get our share. There is no one like our great president. And
look at the new appointments. These are not just 'yes-men'. These
are people who foolishly stood up and opposed him. What did he
do? Did he throw them in prison, rob, torture and kill them, the
way a lesser statesman would?  Not at all. He brings them into
his government! He lets them pose with him under the holy picture!&quot;<BR>
When will our turn come, Abu Salem?  I asked.<BR>
&quot;Oh, it may take generations. We must hold on, Abu Tayeb.&quot;<BR>
Just then the fan sputtered and stopped. &quot;Lucky this isn't
an airplane&quot;, said Abu Salem. &quot;Let's go over to Abu
Fox.  Maybe his is working.&quot;<BR>
Maybe he's got water, I said.<BR>
He didn't have water, but his fan was working, and on the wall
was a picture of the holy Jerusalem. We sat on the edge of the
crowd that was there for the fan and managed to catch some air,
and we listened with delight to the wonderful talk about our great
president.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Issue of Palestinian Refugees: Present and Future*</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Mahmoud al-Khatib<BR>
(2-2)</B></CENTER></P>

<P><BR>
<B>Four:  International Resolutions Related to Palestinian Refugees
and UNRWA</B><BR>
When the problem of the Palestinian refugees first came into existence,
the international community attempted to intervene and to provide
a solution.<BR>
In general, there are three classical solutions to refugee problems
which are: repatriation, emigration from the country of first
asylum, and integration in the country of first asylum.<BR>
The communal conflict in Palestine arising from the aspirations
of Zionism created a different kind of refugee problem. The Palestinian
Arabs who left or were driven from their homes over a period of
a year before and after the establishment of the State of Israel
in May, 1948 saw themselves not as refugees but as very temporary
absentees.  Far from seeking to distance themselves from their
native soil and create a new existence elsewhere, they sought
actively to return.  For them there was but one solution: repatriation<B>(7)</B>.
<BR>
There were overwhelming humanitarian reasons in favor of repatriation
to relieve the state of the burden of caring for the destitute
refugees.  Count Folke Bernadotte, the United Nations Mediator
in Palestine, recommended in the report he had prepared for submission
only hours before he was murdered by Jewish terrorists in Jerusalem,
that, &quot;The right of innocent people, uprooted from their
homes by the present terror and ravages of war, should be affirmed
and made effective&quot;, with compensation for the property of
those who might choose not to return<B>(8)</B>. <BR>
UN General Assembly Resolution 194 of December 11, 1948, Paragraph
11, embodies this principle: &quot;The General Assembly having
considered further the situation in Palestine, resolves that the
refugees wishing to return to their homes and live in peace with
their neighbors should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable
date, and that compensation should be paid for the property of
those choosing not to return and for loss of or damage to property
which, under principles of international law or in equity, should
be made good by the governments or authorities responsible.&quot;<B>(9)</B><BR>
This resolution is clear and specific, calling for the return
of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland and for the provision
of compensation to whoever might choose not to return, compensation
for their lands and for the possessions which they had lost, in
addition to whatever damage they had sustained as a result of
having left their homeland and gone to live in exile.  Israel
rejected this resolution when it was passed, and continues to
reject it at the present time despite the fact that the UN General
Assembly affirms it repeatedly in its yearly meetings.<BR>
In November, 1967, following of the same year which led to Israel's
occupation of the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, the Golan Heights
in Syria and the Sinai peninsula in Egypt, the International Security
Council passed Resolution 242.  Article 1 of this resolution demands
that Israel withdraw from the territories which it occupied in
June, 1967, while Article 2 affirms the necessity of a just settlement
to the problem of the refugees.</P>

<P><B>The United Nations Relief and Works Agency (UNRWA)</B><BR>
Due to the increasing seriousness of the humanitarian dimension
of the refugee problem, the UN decided to establish a special
organization for the purpose of seeing to refugees' affairs and
offering them humanitarian aid.  Resolution 302 passed by the
UN General Assembly on December 8, 1949:<BR>
&quot;7.	Establishes the United Nations Relief and Works Agency
for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA):<BR>
a)	to carry out in collaboration with local governments the direct
relief and works program as recommended by the Economic Survey
Mission;<BR>
b)	To consult with interested Near Eastern governments concerning
measures to be taken by them preparatory to the time when international
assistance for relief and works projects is no longer available.&quot;</P>

<P>UNRWA commenced its work on May 1, 1950 to take the place of
three international charitable organizations, namely: the League
of Red Cross Societies, the International Committee of the Red
Cross and the American Friends Service Committee, which at that
time were undertaking responsibility for feeding more than 960,000
Palestinian refugees.<BR>
UNRWA began by focusing its efforts on offering relief services
to the refugees.  However, when it became aware that there was
little hope of the refugees returning to their homeland in the
near future, it had no choice but to begin offering education
and basic health services to the approximately 1,000,000 Palestinian
refugees in its charge.<BR>
Today, fifty years after the refugee problem came into existence,
UNRWA is still carrying on its mission, which consists in the
provision of three types of programs: education, health, and relief
and social services for Palestinian refugees in 59 camps located
in the West Bank, the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon, as
well as in areas close to the camps in which concentrations of
refugees live.  UNRWA's mission is not to work for the return
of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland.  Rather, its work
is primarily humanitarian, intended to continue until such time
as a just, comprehensive solution is reached for the refugees'
problem.  Hence, UNRWA's presence and the continuation of its
work have become symbols of the ongoing existence of the Palestinian
cause, and of the failure to find a solution to it.<BR>
UNRWA's yearly budget comes from donations from various governments,
in particular, the United States, the European Community, and
Japan.  Its regular annual budget for 1997 came to approximately
$352 million, received in the form of cash and in-kind donations.</P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B>Five: 	The Future of the Refugee Problem</B><BR>
Thus far the Israeli government has refused to recognize UN Resolution
194, which calls for the return of the Palestinian refugees to
their homes.  Nevertheless, it claims to be willing to discuss
the matter of the refugees.  The Palestinians insist upon the
adoption of Resolution 194 as the starting point for any solution
to their dilemma, while the Israelis insist on considering UN
Resolutions 242 of 1967 and 338 of 1973 as such a starting point.
 According to the Israelis, the only lasting, just solution to
the problem of the Palestinian refugees is not their return to
their lands, but simply compensating them for possessions lost
<B>(11)</B>.<BR>
Nor does Israel recognize the UN definition of a Palestinian refugee,
since it does not consider the children or grandchildren of refugees,
who were born outside Palestine, to be refugees as well.  The
Israeli position on the refugee issue may be summarized in the
following three points:<BR>
1.	The security claim: Israel claims that the return of the Palestinians
to their original lands would pose a serious threat to Israeli
security.<BR>
2.	The demographic claim: Israel claims that the return of the
Palestinians to their original homelands would upset the demographic
balance [i.e., the ratio of Jews to Arabs] in Israel, thereby
threatening its security.	<BR>
3.	The legal claim: Israel claims that Resolution 194, which specifies
the right of return, does not apply to the case of the Palestinians
<B>(12)</B>.</P>

<P>According to a study prepared by Israeli Shlomo Gazet, Israel
refuses to deal with the issue of the refugees of 1948 unless
this is done within the framework of a comprehensive settlement
between Israel and all of the Arab states.  In addition, Israel
demands that the Arabs absorb the Palestinian refugees into their
own lands, just as Israel has taken in Jewish refugees from Arab
countries; hence, Israel demands that Arab governments offer mutual
compensation.  Moreover, Israel is calling for communal rather
than individual compensation in the sense that compensation moneys
would be placed in a fund at the disposal of the UN, which would
work on settling the refugees presently located in countries outside
their homeland.  The compensation proposed for each refugee recognized
by Israel would come to $10,000 <B>(13)</B>.<BR>
By a simple calculation we find that the compensation due to 800,000
Palestinian refugees recognized by Israel would come to $8 billion.
 Israel estimates that there are 1.5 million Jews who have taken
refuge in Israel from Arab countries.  Hence, Arab countries would
have to pay damages to the Arab Jews in the amount of approximately
$15 billion.<BR>
The Declaration of Principles signed in Washington on September
13, 1993 between the Israeli government and the PLO postpones
dealing with the matter of the refugees until the final status
talks to be begun next year.<BR>
Given Israeli intransigence and the attitude of the Israeli government
toward the execution of the Oslo accords as they relate to the
redeployment of Israeli occupation forces in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip, in addition to Israel's rejection of the notion
of allowing the estimated 600,000 displaced persons to return,
it is unlikely that Israel would agree even to a discussion of
the return of the refugees.<BR>
Given such considerations, it becomes apparent that the only potential
solution between the Israeli government on one hand, and the Arab
countries hosting refugees and the PLO on the other, lies in settling
the refugees in the regions where they presently reside, or in
other countries willing to settle them.  It is a solution which
appears to be feasible despite the fact that the refugees themselves
have thus far rejected it.<BR>
The Jordanian government, for example, which hosts approximately
1.5 million Palestinian refugees representing approximately 40%
of all refugees registered with UNRWA, faces no big difficulties
in absorbing such refugees, who enjoy full Jordanian nationality
and whose rights and responsibilities hardly differ from those
of regular Jordanian citizens.  Article 8 of the peace treaty
signed by Jordan and Israel in 1994 provides that the Jordanian
and Israeli sides will strive to mitigate the problems between
them relating to the refugees by &quot;carrying out agreed-upon
programs of the UN as well as other international economic programs
related to both Palestinian refugees and displaced persons, including
efforts toward settling them [on Jordanian soil].&quot;<BR>
As for the Palestinian Authority, it has no way to impose its
position on the Israeli side.  It is also feared that Mr. Arafat's
expected declaration of the establishment of a Palestinian state
in parts of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip will be taken by
Israel as a justification for claiming that the Palestinian refugees
presently living in the West Bank and Gaza are merely living in
their own homeland - the Palestinian State - in which case they
may be removed from the rolls of refugees.  In any case, it is
clear that the Israeli government is capable of imposing its refusal
to allow the return of the refugees on the Palestinian self-rule
authority.<BR>
Lebanon remains the only Arab country which takes a negative,
intransigent attitude toward settling Palestinian refugees on
its land.  This attitude is due at least in part to the fear that
the Palestinian refugees in Lebanon, the majority of whom are
Sunni Muslims, would disturb the confessional make-up of the Lebanese
population.  There are large, unspecified numbers of Palestinians
who emigrated from Lebanon to Europe, America and Australia during
and after the Civil War years.  However, even this problem might
possibly be solved by means of Syrian pressure on the Lebanese
government within the framework of a comprehensive settlement,
whereby the Lebanese government would be compensated for settling
Palestinian refugees on its territory. Meanwhile, large numbers
of these refugees could likewise be absorbed by other countries
of the world.<BR>
Conclusion<BR>
The matter of the Palestinian refugees is one of the thorniest
issues between the Arabs and the Israelis.  Given the present
balance of power existing between the Palestinian Authority and
Israel, there appears to be no hope of resolving the issue in
a way which would involve the refugees' actual return to their
homes.  Rather, the only solution which I foresee is that of settling
the refugees in the areas where they have been residing for the
past fifty years or more, with the added possibility of allowing
some of the refugees living in Lebanon to be absorbed by other
countries.  As for the compensation which might be agreed to by
the Israeli government or donated by the international community,
it will go to the Arab countries presently hosting the Palestinian
refugees.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Legitimacy of Palestinian Resistance.. An Islamist
Perspective</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</B></CENTER></P>

<P><B><I>The purpose of this paper is to introduce the Islamic
justification for the legitimacy of the struggle for the liberation
of Palestine. The paper will present the viewpoint of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas).</I></B></P>

<P>Its founder and leader, Sheikh Ahmad Yassin, has recently expressed
the official position of Hamas. According to him, the movement
struggles against Israel because it is the aggressing, usurping
and oppressing State that hoists the rifle in the face of our
sons and daughters day and night.</P>

<P>The prospect of the movement initiating, or accepting, dialogue
with Israel is non-existent at present because of the skewed balance
of power between the Palestinians and the Israelis. In Sheikh
Yassin's own words: </P>

<P>There can be no dialogue between a party that is strong and
oppressive and another that is weak and oppressed. There can be
no dialogue except after the elimination of oppression. We will
continue to communicate with Israel using the same weapon it has
been using against us-the rifle. We will teach Israel who truly
is the strong party that possesses the right and the land. We
shall continue to communicate with it using the same method until
the entire land of Palestine, and not only a part of it, is liberated.</P>

<P>(Sheikh Yassin was released from Israeli detention in September
1997 after about 9 years of imprisonment. His release was part
of a deal concluded between Jordan and Israel in the aftermath
of the Mossad's failed assassination attempt in Amman on the life
of Khalid Misha'al, head of Hamas Political Department.) </P>

<P>In justifying its armed resistance against Israel, Hamas considers
itself an extension of an old tradition that goes back to the
early twentieth-century struggle against British and Zionist colonialism.
</P>

<P>A number of observations will help to understand the nature
of Hamas and its rationale:</P>

<P>1.	All forms of resistance adopted by the movement stem from
the same justifications upon which the national Palestinian resistance
movement based its struggle for more than a quarter of a century.
At least the first ten articles of the Palestinian National Charter
show complete compatibility with Hamas' discourse as elaborated
in its Charter and other declarations.  Furthermore, the same
justifications for resistance had, prior to the emergence of Hamas
in December 1987, been recognized, or endorsed, by a variety of
regional and international bodies such as the Arab League, the
Islamic Conference Organization, the Non-Aligned Movement and
the United Nations.  The recognition that the Israeli occupation
of at least the West Bank and Gaza Strip in 1967 is illegal can
be clearly read in the United Nations Security Council resolutions
242 and 338. </P>

<P>2.	Islam is Hamas' ideological frame of reference. It is from
the values of Islam that the movement seeks inspiration in its
mobilization efforts and in compensating for the huge difference
in material resources between the Palestinian people and their
supporters on the one hand and Israel and its supporters on the
other. In so doing, Hamas does not invent an unprecedented position.
In fact, most Palestinian resistance movements have at one point
or another referred to Islam, both its doctrines and history,
to inspire their strugglers to sacrifice, observe a high degree
of patience and steadfastness and hope for either victory or martyrdom.
This is not surprising taking into consideration the fact that
the justifications for resistance have always emanated from a
common Palestinian situation. The Palestinians are Arabs whose
culture, whether they are Muslim or Christian, is heavily influenced
by Islamic values and Islamic terminology.  They all feel Israel,
whose policy of expansionism through deceit or violence has never
changed since its creation in 1948, has inflicted a great injustice
upon them.</P>

<P>Deriving justification of armed resistance from Islam, the
movement declares in its charter: </P>

<P>The day the enemies usurp a Muslim land, Jihad becomes fard-u-'ayn
(compulsory) upon every single Muslim. To confront the Jews, who
have usurped Palestine, the banner of Jihad must be hoisted.</P>

<P>The modern history of Palestine is rich in Islamic slogans.
Apart from a very brief era of extreme secularization during the
period 1967 and 1987, the Palestinian national struggle has generally
been Islamic in identity and slogans. The discourse of people
such as Sheikh Ezziddin Al-Qassam and Al-Hajj Amin Al-Husseini
was Islamic in nature. Such discourse was not restricted to Muslims.
Christians, who fought under the banner of the Arab Supreme Committee
or Abdel-Qader al-Husseini's Al-Jihad Al-Muqaddas, used the same
language and emanated from the same motivation. Although certain
circles, especially in the Western and Arab secular media, endeavour
to portray Hamas as if it were an aberration from the norm, the
exact opposite is the case. </P>

<P>3.	The Oslo agreement between the PLO and Israel represents
an aberration, or deviation, from what hitherto had been a unified
Palestinian position vis-&agrave;-vis the Israeli occupation of
Palestine. The agreement has allowed some Palestinians to object,
for the first time, to armed resistance because, according to
them, the peace process would bring an end to occupation and would
lead to the establishment of an independent Palestinian State.
</P>

<P>One must draw attention here to the fact that Hamas exercised
armed struggle long before the Madrid Conference and the Oslo
Agreement. Therefore it would be erroneous to suggest that the
continuation of such resistance be aimed at undermining, or derailing,
the peace process. Nevertheless, the post-Oslo era has been one
of extreme hardship for the movement. Circumstances have changed
domestically, regionally and internationally rendering armed resistance
very costly and extremely difficult to exercise. It is not only
Israel that is now mobilized against Hamas but also, very regrettably,
the Palestinian Authority, whose main task, as stipulated in the
Oslo agreement, is to protect Israel by controlling the Palestinian
population under its administration. Notwithstanding the anti-Hamas
disposition of the Palestine Authority, Hamas has exercised a
high degree of self-restraint to avoid being drawn into a Palestinian-Palestinian
fight. Such a prospect, the movement maintains, would only be
of benefit to the Israelis. Nothing the PA may do, including imprisonment
and persecution of Hamas activists, or even handing them over
to the Israelis, should be responded to by an act of violence
against the PA but rather against Israel itself. Such a position
has gained Hamas, in the eyes of Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims,
respect and has fortified its legitimacy.</P>

<P>4.	Oslo defenders claimed for months following its signing
that it would bring an end to occupation and that, therefore,
the Palestinians needed no longer exercise armed struggle against
the Israelis. But five years after Oslo, what do we see on the
ground? The territories are still occupied, like never before;
the West Bank and Gaza Strip have been carved, mutilated and turned
into isolated islets of human concentrations, or cantons, administered
on behalf of the Israelis by the PA; existing Jewish settlements
are being expanded and new ones are being erected; Jerusalem is
being expanded and de-Arabized; large areas of land have been
confiscated to allow for the construction of bypasses for the
exclusive use of Jewish motorists; thousands of Palestinians continue
to be detained in Israeli prisons; forms of collective punishment
continue to be adopted, including the demolition of homes and
the closure of entire areas; and the economic situation is much
worse than ever before. In other words, the peace process has
not improved the conditions of Palestinians under occupation and
does not seem to promise any better future.</P>

<P>The claim that armed struggle was no longer necessary has therefore
been refuted by reality, giving credence to the argument of Hamas
(which is no different from the argument adopted before Oslo by
the nationalist movement as a whole and that continues to be adopted
by a score of Palestinian factions opposed to Oslo) that armed
struggle is the only real means of liberation. It should be noted
here that no one within the Palestinian camp claimed it was illegal,
including those who signed Oslo. This position is further fortified
by the recognition on the part of the international community,
including the United States of America-despite its unconditional
support for Israel-that Israeli occupation of the territories
is illegitimate. Ironically, Oslo, in the long run, serves Hamas
more that it serves the PA.</P>

<P>5.	Hamas has continually endeavoured to maintain good relations
with all sectors of Palestinian society and to introduce itself
to them, both Muslims and Christians, religious and secularist,
as a national liberation movement that shares with them the aspiration
to see Palestine liberated from foreign occupation and governed
by its own people. </P>

<P>Those within the Palestinian national camp who attempt to view
Hamas more comprehensively and opt to consider all its dimensions
find a vast area of common ground where cooperation, constructive
dialogue and mutual understanding can take place. On the one hand,
Hamas is an important &quot;reinforcer&quot; of the people's steadfastness
in the face of Israeli occupation by alleviating the hardship
suffered by the Palestinians. On the other hand, it contributes
effectively to checking PA corruption and injustices.</P>

<P>6.	Hamas successes among the Palestinians have been paralleled
by successes across the region and internationally. This accomplishment
has been made possible by virtue of the fact that the organization
adheres to the general Arab and Islamic standing vis-&agrave;-vis
Israel and the U.S.-sponsored peace process. The recent tour of
a number of Arab and Islamic countries by Hamas founder and leader
Sheikh Ahmad Yassin is a clear indication of this success. The
tour could even be read as an important message to whom it may
concern. The message is that the Arabs and Muslims, both governments
and peoples, by receiving and celebrating Sheikh Yassin, provide
his movement with an umbrella of legitimacy, endorsing its armed
resistance against Israeli occupation and expressing objection
to the imposed settlement which does away with the rights of the
Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims in Palestine. </P>

<P>This position finds strong support among an increasing number
of non-Arab and non-Muslim countries in the Southern Hemisphere.
Many such nations now consider Hamas a movement of national liberation
against colonialism. </P>

<P>7.	In spite of the overwhelming militant image it has in the
minds of many people in the West, Hamas is not a mere military
faction. It is a political, cultural and social grass-roots organization
that has a separate military wing specializing in armed struggle
against the Israelis. Apart from this clandestine military wing,
all other sections within Hamas function through overt public
platforms. The military wing has its own leadership and recruiting
mechanism. The political department, and for that matter institutions
concerned with social, medical or educational services to the
public, has no direct say in the manner in which the military
apparatus, known as the Ezziddin Al-Qassam Brigades, functions
or the way in which it selects its targets. Some would even suggest
that the relationship between the political department and the
military wing is analogous to the relationship between Sinn Fein
and the IRA.</P>

<P>Hamas social and educational activities in the occupied territories
have become so entrenched within the Palestinian community that
neither the Israelis nor their peace partners in the Palestinian
Authority have been able to extricate them. The fact of the matter
is that Hamas, contrary to Israeli assessment, acts as an infrastructure
to the numerous cultural, educational and social institutions
in Gaza and the West Bank that renders invaluable and irreplaceable
services to the public. In other words, it is Hamas that gives
life to these institutions and not the reverse. The Israelis have
repeatedly told the PA to close them down. The PA has tried but
failed. A crackdown on these institutions amounts to a declaration
of war not against Hamas but against the community as a whole.
This is so simply because the role played by these institutions
is indispensable. Neither Israel nor the PA has been able to provide
an alternative.</P>

<P>8.	A distinguishing feature of the Hamas armed struggle is
its discipline. Contrary to the experience of most other Palestinian
factions, the Hamas armed struggle emanates from Palestine and
is restricted to its territory, to what Hamas considers to be
the legitimate battlefield. By limiting its armed struggle to
resisting occupation, the movement has successfully averted Israeli
attempts to drag it to a battle outside Palestine. The assassination
attempt on the life of Khalid Misha'al, the Hamas political head,
was clearly intended to embroil the movement in a war of attrition
outside Palestine-a battle Hamas has continuously tried to avoid.
 Adhering to this position on the part of Hamas has made it rather
difficult for the Israelis and their allies, especially in the
U.S., to convince the world's public opinion that Hamas is a terrorist
group. By all standards, Hamas is a national liberation movement
whose military effort is directed solely and exclusively at the
foreign occupiers of its people's land inside the occupied land.
 </P>

<P>9.	In recent times, the Hamas military wing (Ezziddin Al-Qassam
Brigades) planned and carried out a number of what Hamas calls
'amaliyyat Istish-hadiyah' (martyrdom operations). These are usually
described in the Western media as suicide operations. These operations,
which target civilians, are considered an aberration from Hamas'
fundamental position of hitting only military targets. Hamas officials
insist that these operations represent an exception necessitated
by the Israeli insistence on targeting Palestinian civilians and
by Israel's refusal to agree to an understanding prohibiting the
killing of civilians on both sides-an understanding comparable
to the one reached between Israel and Hizbollah in southern Lebanon.
</P>

<P>The first Istish-hadi operation came in response to the massacre
of Muslim worshippers as they kneeled in prayer in Al-Masjid al-Ibrahimi
at dawn on the fifteenth day of the fasting holy month of Ramadan
(25 February 1994). Sheikh Yassin, who offered the Israelis a
truce, explained that his movement does not endorse the killing
of civilians, but that it is sometimes the only option it has
if it is to respond to the murdering of Palestinian civilians.
In spite of the offer to refrain from killing civilians if the
Israelis promised to do the same, the Israelis insist on ignoring
the offer. Hamas accuses the Israelis of having always been responsible
for the resumption of its attacks on Israeli civilians. </P>

<P>Evidently, for seven months prior to the Israeli assassination
of Yahya Ayyash, commander of the Hamas Brigades known as the
&quot;Engineer&quot;, the movement observed a unilateral cease-fire.
What Israel came to witness following Ayyash's assassination was
to be regretted by Shimon Peres for the rest of his life. The
assassination, which was meant to bring victory to the Israelis
and humiliation to the Palestinians, cost Peres his political
career and has, by bringing Netanyahu to power, changed the course
of history. With his own hands, Peres destroyed his own dream
of a 'new Middle East' in which Israel would become an accepted
entity. <BR>
Ayyash's funeral, and the funerals of several other Hamas leaders,
showed clearly that the Palestinian people as a whole identify
with the struggle of Hamas. The rage exhibited by thousands of
mourners whenever Israel succeeds in eliminating a military leader
is a testimony that armed resistance is a true expression of the
wishes of the Palestinians whose daily encounters with occupation,
humiliation and oppression, reinforces their conviction that only
the language of force pays off.</P>

<P>10.	Soon after his release from jail, leader Sheikh Ahmad Yassin
offered the Israelis a truce.  He declared that Hamas would be
willing to go as far as to sign a cease-fire agreement with Israel
on the following conditions:</P>

<P>(a)	The truce lasts for a given period of time and does not
entail recognition of the State of Israel;</P>

<P>(b)	Israel agrees to withdraw all its troops from the 1967-occupied
territories;</P>

<P>(c)	Israel agrees to dismantle all Jewish settlements erected
on Palestinian soil since 1967;</P>

<P>(d)	Israel agrees to free all Palestinian prisoners in its
detention centres;</P>

<P>(e)	Hamas agrees to stop all military operations against Israeli
targets for the duration of the agreed period. </P>

<P>So far, Israel has rejected this offer. Sheikh Yassin believes,
however, that sooner or later the Israelis will change their minds
and eventually accept a temporary cease-fire. Sheikh Yassin is
optimistic about the long term. He believes that the world is
already witnessing the beginning of the end of the Zionist project.
He predicts that in less than 30 years from now, Israel will be
gone.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Israel's latest weapons of mass destruction: water
and ecology!</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><BR>
<B>By Dr. Daud A. Abdullah*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>As regional leaders prepare to observe the seventh anniversary
of the Madrid Conference later this month, distress and anger
continue to spread dangerously among the Palestinians trapped
under Israeli occupation in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.  Their
worsening misery has not, however, been confined to the ongoing
deaths in detention or the cold-blooded murder of their hounded
political activists. With water supplies effectively cut from
their homes for the past four months, all indications are that
many more will probably die of thirst instead of bullets in the
weeks ahead.  For all its worth, therefore, Israel's arbitrary
denial of drinking water to the Palestinians and pollution of
their rivers, agricultural lands and atmosphere with toxic waste
should altogether be condemned as illegal weapons of mass-destruction
no less deadly than its stockpiles of nuclear, chemical or biological
weapons. <BR>
Five years after the signing of the Oslo accords more than half
a million Palestinians in the West Bank, about one third of the
area's population, are forced to trek miles each day in search
of drinking water.  Although the crisis began among them after
the 1967 occupation of their territories, its severity increased
considerably in the 1990s, particularly after Oslo.  The immediate
reason has evidently been due to Israel's inability to satisfy
the growing water needs of its colonies and agricultural projects.
 Hence, it resorted to the seizure of Palestinian water.  Today
the Israeli-owned Mekerot Water Company supplies the dispossessed
Palestinians with only 17% of the underground water from Palestinian
land, which produces about 660 million cubic metres of water annually
(m3/yr).  Most of the water pumped from the occupied territories
is, on the contrary, diverted in unlimited quantities for Israeli
use behind the Green Line or to the Jewish colonies scattered
throughout the West Bank. <BR>
Of the West Bank towns, Hebron and Bethlehem have been hardest
hit by the current water crisis.  The former, which is inhabited
by an estimated 300,000 Palestinians, requires about 25,000 m3
daily.  They only receive 5,500 m3 from the Israeli-administered
company.  Likewise, despite the numerous wells below its surface,
Bethlehem's 180,000 inhabitants receive only 8,000 m3 from an
expected daily supply of 18,000 m3 in the summer.   In Jenin,
another 40,000 Palestinians have been forced to make do with 2,400
m3 per day.   That the crisis engulfing the West Bank is an artificial
and man-made one is reflected in the fact that the quota granted
to the average Jewish settler in the West Bank is five times more
than what is given to the Palestinians; hence 120,000 settlers
receive 50 million m3/yr.<BR>
There are, in addition to the distribution figures, other factors
that confirm the human role in creating this prevailing crisis.
 Having come from areas where water shortages are virtually unknown,
many settlers from the former Soviet Union have persisted with
their old lifestyles of high water consumption. As a result, the
sight of settlers profusely washing their cars, watering flowers,
or bathing in swimming pools is especially agonizing to the Palestinians
who cannot find drinking water for their children. Indeed, for
those who live in Hebron the pain becomes even more excruciating
when they witness the amount of water that is used to drench the
flower garden dedicated to Baruch Goldstein, the settler who massacred
29 Palestinian worshippers in February 1994.<BR>
The steady deepening of the West Bank water crisis has, over the
past five years, given rise to a growing commercial activity in
which the Palestinians are grossly exploited. After taking into
account the differences of individual salaries, it is believed
that Palestinians paid seven times more for domestic water in
1992 than their Israeli counterparts-in spite of the meagre supplies
and poor services.  Under the circumstances, several small traders
with the necessary means have embarked upon the sale of water
not only to individuals but also to hospitals and clinics.  Although
this may initially seem to be a source of relief, residents in
the territories confirm that it invariably takes days before a
private tanker can itself deliver a supply of water.<BR>
Regional implications<BR>
There is no doubt that Israel's current water crisis spells danger
not only for the Palestinians but also for the Arab nation as
a whole.  The issue of water was considered so important for regional
peace that a special committee was set up to discuss it at the
multilateral negotiations with Israel after Madrid.  Notwithstanding,
the region's natural features suggest that the problem is almost
certain to worsen as time progresses. With desert accounting for
60% of Israel, 70% of Syria, 85% of Jordan and 90% of Egypt,1
it is clear that water is destined to become a deciding factor
in the achievement of peace or the outbreak of war in this volatile
region.  Already, Arab disputes with Turkey and Ethiopia over
the waters of the Euphrates and Nile respectively have been fueled
by mistrust of Israel's strategic involvement in both countries.
<BR>
Significantly, the threat posed to regional stability by the availability
or lack of water has been confirmed by several official and independent
sources. Recent figures published by the Israeli Mekorot Water
Company suggest that the gap between water supply and consumption
in Jordan is expected to reach 650 m3/yr by the year 2020. In
the Palestinian Authority territories the gap will also rise to
250 m3/yr by the same year.2  <BR>
Because of its importance, water requirements throughout the Arab
world are calculated on a minimum basis known as &quot;minimum
water requirement&quot; (MWR). With a collective population approaching
235 million, the quantity of water available per person is approximately
750 m3/yr, a figure well below the minimum requirement.3  If the
Arab population reaches 295 million by the year 2000, the average
person's share of water will drop to 575 m3.  And so with more
than half of the countries in the region now facing severe shortages
in water supplies, security in this area will be greatly undermined,
especially with the growth of population.  Should present population
trends continue, it is expected that the water share of the average
Arab will fall by 50% by the year 2025. <BR>
Water and the environment<BR>
Although agriculture is the largest sector in the Palestinian
economy, the quantity of water allocated for irrigation in the
West Bank has never been increased since the start of the Israeli
occupation in 1967.  Due to the strict controls and licensing
requirements for digging wells, the area of Palestinian irrigated
land has remained just as it was since the late 1960s.  While
these crippling conditions were being imposed upon the Palestinians,
the area of Israeli-controlled irrigated land grew by 340,000
dunums between 1970 and 1990.4  On account of this vast disparity
in the water distributed between the two peoples, Palestinians
in the territories pay four times more for unmanufactured agricultural
imports than the Israelis.<BR>
The lethal combination of poverty and environmental neglect has
naturally had destructive consequences throughout occupied Palestine.
Founding chairman of the Israel Union for Environmental Defence,
Alon Tal, acknowledged the depth of ecological damage that has
been caused by the Israelis in their mad rush to survive and gain
security in a foreign land.  &quot;It's a Zionist paradox. We
came here to redeem a land and we end up contaminating it.&quot;5
 Though implanted in the heart of the Arab and Islamic world to
be an outpost of European civilization, the Israeli project in
Palestine appears, at best, to be a gross misrepresentation of
Western values and concerns, not least of which are the preservation
of the environment.  Israel's excessive use of nitrogen fertilizers
to increase crop production has led to the massive pollution of
underground water sources.  As early as 1991 an official report
confirmed that one third of the wells in the country had nitrate
levels well above the maximum allowed for drinking water in the
United States and Europe. Meanwhile, with the uncontrolled emission
of pollutants like carbon monoxide into the atmosphere, smog levels
are expected to double its permitted maximum by the year 2000.
 Of course, while most Israelis would be able to benefit from
American and European medical care because of their dual citizenship,
the impoverished Palestinians affected by this contamination will
hardly have a chance of survival. <BR>
Still, behind the Green Line, all the main rivers have become
swirling canals notorious for the dumping and transport of sewage
and industrial waste.  It was no wonder, therefore, that toxins
were responsible for the deaths of three of the four athletes
who died in the Yarkon River when their bus plunged into it in
1997.  Environmentalists lament that only one third of all sewage
is properly treated in Israel before it is discharged.<BR>
In the West Bank the constant overflow of drains has, in recent
weeks, caused damage to no less than 30 dunums of olive groves.
 Similarly, over 700 dunums of vegetables have been destroyed
in Hebron by waste released by Jewish settlers.  In the neighbouring
Gaza Strip, the consequences of Israeli environmental pollution
has been devastating.  The imminent dangers posed to the Palestinians
have been accentuated by the fact that this enclave is one of
the most densely populated areas in the world; containing more
than 1 million inhabitants, of which about 766,124 are refugees
or their descendants from 1948.  Today the constant flow of sewage
waste from the &quot;Gosh Qateef&quot; and &quot;Netzarim&quot;
into the coastal waters has all but destroyed the area's marine
life.<BR>
As the water and environmental crises in the occupied territories
intensify, many Palestinians have, quite understandably, become
completely cynical about the official 'peace process.' Umm Ziyad
from the Dheisheh refugee camp poignantly reflected the concern
of an ever-increasing number of Palestinians when she remarked:
&quot;They steal the land we eat from and the water that we drink.
 Nothing is left except that they should deny us air to breathe.
 I know if they were able to do this, they would surely have done
so.&quot;  While no civilized conscience would be able to dispel
the truth of Umm Ziyad's assertions, the question remains: of
what use would be the air when it becomes totally polluted and
poisoned?<BR>
That the water crisis in the West Bank and Gaza Strip poses a
direct threat to regional peace is, by any standard, an understatement.
That water is an essential need for human life cannot be contested.
 There can, indeed, be no production of any kind without its adequate
supply. Israel's absolute and unbridled control of the water sources
in occupied Palestine will, therefore, always be a formula for
the unequal distribution of this resource; even if it accedes
to token increases here and there.  No amount of accords, in Oslo,
Washington or Taba, will resolve the current crises until recognition
is given to the Palestinians' right to a sovereign State on their
land.  The issue is clearly not about numbers or percentage shares
but rather about a peoples' independence and sovereignty over
their national resources.  Having previously tried the brute methods
of &quot;transfer&quot; (expulsion) and failed, observers are
now speculating as to whether the Zionists have actually decided
to use water and ecology as effectual weapons of mass destruction
to subdue and destroy the Palestinian national will. </P>

<H3><CENTER>(AB)USING ISLAM</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Aisha Khan</B></CENTER></P>

<P>U.S. President Bill Clinton's desperate and ultimately unsuccessful
attempt to deflect attention from his domestic crisis has once
again highlighted Western attitudes to the Third World, especially
Muslim countries. Just the fact that the U.S. can, with impunity
and no consequences at all, act at will against any country it
feels like with absolutely any method available to serve its own
interests-coups, air strikes, bombings, assassinations, kidnappings-damns
international opinion and law.<BR>
Another interesting aspect to the brazen strikes in Sudan and
Afghanistan is the raising of the Islamic bogey. Samuel P. Huntington
had predicted that the West, after defeating communism, would
have to now battle with the last enemy of the &quot;free world&quot;-Islam.
This &quot;clash of the civilizations&quot; theory is used whenever
convenient to further American strategic and material interests
around the globe.  So, when things began to get too hot for Bill
Clinton in Washington, the best option was to bomb camps allegedly
run by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, conveniently forgetting
that Afghan militants had been funded and nurtured from scratch
by the U.S. in its battle against the former Soviet Union. They
were also used to nip at Iran's eastern flank and distract it
as it fought its protracted war with Iraq.  With the Russians
having fled and the Soviet Union totally disintegrated, these
same militants have now lost their use and now have to be eradicated.
The ostensible reason behind the strikes was that militants from
those camps were responsible for the bombing of U.S. missions
in Kenya and Tanzania, though no direct evidence was provided.
<BR>
Having bombed Afghanistan and Sudan in the name of fighting terrorism,
especially of the Islamic variety, the U.S. has characteristically
declared that no other country can similarly protect its national
interests.  So the Indian Government, which had enthusiastically
welcomed the strikes thinking it could form a bond on the basis
of a common threat of &quot;Islamic terrorism&quot;, was rapped
on the knuckles by big brother. Officials in fact lamented the
fact that the U.S. had not informed or consulted India since many
of the camps allegedly also trained militia which were sent to
Kashmir. India was told categorically that bombing sites that
one suspected of training terrorists was only the U.S. prerogative.
So India's grandiose dreams of &quot;hot pursuit&quot; of Kashmiri
militant bases into Pakistani territory were put to rest. <BR>
Ineffectual in domestic politics, the Bharatiya Janata Party Government
is only busy making as much noise as possible at various international
forums.  Witness the manner in which India overreacted to long-time
friend Nelson Mandela's call for a speedy solution to the Kashmir
imbroglio. While Mr. Mandela had only called for negotiations,
not even third-party mediation, Indian Prime Minister Atal Behari
Vajpayee reacted immediately, terming the remarks &quot;uncalled
for&quot; and generally kicking up a lot of diplomatic dust. A
clarification from South Africa was tom-tommed as an apology,
which deputy president Thabo Mbeki had to later deny. <BR>
Within India, of course, the Hindu nationalist-led federal government
is turning a blind eye to discrimination or atrocities against
Muslims. In the western State of Maharashtra, BJP ally Shiv Sena,
a neo-fascist and xenophobic party that specializes in targeting
Muslims, began the sudden deportation of Bengali-speaking Muslims,
alleging that they were illegal Bangladeshi migrants. The fact
that all those deported were actually residents of poor villages
from West Bengal, which is very much part of India, had no effect
on the Shiv Sena Government.  The poor villagers who had come
to Bombay (capital of Maharashtra) seeking a better livelihood
had all kinds of documents, ranging from birth and school certificates
to passports to show their nationality. But the Shiv Sena reaction
was that these documents could be forged. If any document can
be forged, then no one can prove citizenship. But it is clear
that these kinds of statements and this kind of logic is directly
aimed at Muslims, since they are, theoretically, the only large
community who can belong to another nation. Muslims can be &quot;infiltrators&quot;
from Pakistan or Bangladesh or even Afghanistan, but Hindus are,
perforce, from India. Where else could they be from since their
&quot;spiritual home&quot; is India, while Muslims have extra-territorial
religious affinities.<BR>
In fact, Hindu Bangladeshis who come into India are treated as
&quot;refugees,&quot; while Muslims are infiltrators.  Similarly,
no one is concerned about the millions of Nepalese who have made
India their home; again maybe the fact that they are Hindus is
the reason. <BR>
The fact that no one reacted to the warped logic of every document
being forged is amazing, since this can easily be used against
other non-Bengali speaking Muslims, too. Looking like a Muslim
is in it self enough to arouse suspicion. I remember seeing &quot;wanted&quot;
posters for bombing suspects in which the suspects were described
only as &quot;Muslim-looking&quot; youth.<BR>
Across the border, Islam is being used in a different manner.
Already an avowed theocratic State (as against the constitutional
secularism in India), Pakistan is to now have all laws based on
Shariah according to a new bill moved by Prime Minister Nawaz
Sharif. This announcement was made by Sharif when he too found
the domestic going too tough. Faced with sharp criticism from
all quarters for having had prior knowledge of the U.S. intention
to bomb Afghanistan and allowing it to happen over Pakistani airspace,
Nawaz Sharif decided to use Islam as the last resort, much in
the same manner as former military dictator Zia-ul-Haq. <BR>
It is clear that no love of Islam or the Shariah motivated Sharif.
Existing provisions in the Pakistani constitution provided more
than ample scope to implement the Shariah if Sharif wished to
do so. Critics point out that the real reason for the proposed
amendment is that it will help Sharif usurp and concentrate more
powers in his own hands in the name of Islam. The legislative
bill that is to bring this decision into effect has enough portent
of things to come. It states that if it is defeated in the Senate
(where Sharif's Muslim League is in the minority), it will be
voted on by a joint session of parliament, where Sharif is sure
of a majority. Unable to combat the growing problems of unemployment,
rising prices and lawlessness, all of which have been worsened
by economic sanctions, this move is a crass attempt to hoodwink
citizens and consolidate power in the hands of an ineffectual
Prime Minister. <BR>
On the other hand, critics wonder how the logistics of such a
move will be worked out. Pakistan is home to a number of Islamic
sects; will there be different courts for all of them? How will
cases be arbitrated? Ironically, these complications come at a
time when the Pakistani past of fratricide is reaching a new high.
Already clashes between Sunnis and Shiites are escalating, and
added to that are the ever-simmering local Mohajir clashes, enough
to throw the country into a civil war. Instead of dealing with
that, new lines of division and possible conflict are being drawn.<BR>
Back to Afghanistan. Iran's decision to mass troops on its borders
with Afghanistan has raised the hackles of the hypocritical U.S.
regime. The deaths of two American citizens was enough to warrant
multiple strikes against Afghanistan and a single strike in Sudan,
but the killing of seven Iranian diplomats was not enough. <BR>
Iran, of course, has warned both the Taliban regime and its sponsor
(Pakistan) that if things continue like this, they are headed
for a &quot;serious regional conflict.&quot; Taliban spiritual
leader Mulla Mohammed Omar has, in turn, asked Iran to hold negotiations
under the auspices of the United Nations. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Steve Emerson's Investigative Shishkabob</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Sami Howrani*</B></CENTER></P>

<P>He was a Jordanian terrorist of Palestinian origin, trained
at Bin Laden's terror bootcamps in Afghanistan, financed by Iran,
with weapons from Libya, made in China, with North Korean raw
materials, acting on the fatwa of Sheik Abu Flan, who is residing
in New York under cover of a humanitarian organization, fronting
for a terrorist fundraising operation, manned by shadowy figures
who live next door to you, with accounts in the United Arab Emirates,
etc. This could have been a classic Steve Emerson antic.<BR>
During some of Emerson's fantastic and alarmist speculations,
I suspected my neighbour's dog was somehow linked to this global
terrorist network with its tentacles reaching all the way to the
moons of Mars.<BR>
&quot;Few conspiracy theorists can measure up to Steven Emerson,&quot;
commented a journalist of a national media outlet. This is hardly
an honourable distinction but Emerson earned it the old-fashioned
way: loss of peer respect. Arab and Muslim Americans consider
Steven Emerson a deserving heir to Joseph McCarthy, just swap
the word Communism with Arab or Islam.<BR>
But not unlike paid performers or commercial novelists, Steve
Emerson has his loyal audience and readership. He is an entertainer
who offers his admirers a product they are interested in. Considering
some of his innovative plots, Emerson puts Tom Clancy to shame
with his creativity and originality.<BR>
Obviously, Emerson introduced a unique style of investigative
reporting referred to as &quot;Terrorism for Dummies by Dummies&quot;,
or Media McCarthyism. Steve sees Islamic patterns in everything
as well as bearded and turbaned conspiracies lurking behind every
incident.<BR>
Unfortunately for Emerson, and fortunately for the American public,
his highly speculative style of investigative reporting has progressively
damaged his credibility on a number of occasions.<BR>
During the Oklahoma City bombing, Emerson was at the forefront
blaming Arabs and Muslims. &quot;Oklahoma City, I can tell you,
is probably considered one of the largest centres of Islamic radical
activity outside the Middle East&quot;, he said in a CBS News
interview on 19 April 1995. This was frightening news to residents
of Oklahoma, including Muslim Oklahomans.<BR>
There was little surprise when the Washington Post called Emerson
a &quot;pro-Israel researcher and author,&quot; in an 8 August
1998 article. If the Klan is an authority on Jewish and African
American affairs, Emerson is an objective expert on national security
issues. Emerson's analysis reads like a Mossad press release.<BR>
Later, after the TWA 800 crash, Reuters news service quoted Emerson
as saying he is &quot;confident that a bomb brought down the plane.&quot;
Emerson went on to say that the crash could be a plot by &quot;the
permanent floating Islamic militant international&quot;. <BR>
Emerson's evident bias and shoddy reporting led Fairness and Accuracy
in Reporting to reason that &quot;it's this sort of slippery use
of evidence that makes people wary of Emerson's reporting.&quot;
Catching on to Emerson's suspect style, the New York Times Book
Review said Emerson's 1991 book &quot;Terrorist&quot; was &quot;marred
by factual errors...that betray an unfamiliarity with the Middle
East and a pervasive anti-Arab and anti-Palestinian bias.&quot;
<BR>
Why does Emerson attract media coverage? For the same reason Dr.
Ruth Westheimer attracts media attention. There is a niche market
out there in sex, lies and global conspiracies. One U.S. terrorism
expert quipped &quot;if there is a National Inquirer to national
security studies, Emerson would be at the forefront&quot;.<BR>
My advice to aspiring Emersonian wannabes: upon hearing of a terrorist
incident, dust off your investigative skewers and make your rounds.
Don't stop until you hook half a dozen Arab and Muslim States
or so, a sprinkling of communist countries, and a slice or two
of a U.S.-based terrorist fundraising front group. When done,
cook the story in the public opinion pressure cooker while the
news is still hot, then serve Emerson style-very spicy. When asked
about the recipe, swear it's so complex and secretive not even
you can remember it. <BR>
Oh, and by the way, don't forget to throw in the &quot;not all
Muslims or Arabs are bad&quot; after you drop a poison pill in
the pot.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Elections 2000: Arab And Muslim Americans Can Forge
A Viable Coalition</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Muna Salman and Suliman Mustafa* </B></CENTER></P>

<P>One of the principal dilemmas facing Arab and Muslim American
political organizers is the absence of a unifying vision that
can combine Arab and Muslim voters in the U.S. into an effective
voting bloc. From an Arab and Muslim leadership perspective, the
Jewish vote in America is blessed with the greatest gift of all-a
clarity of objectives and solid grass-roots commitment. Can Arab
and Muslim Americans find common grounds to enter the twenty-first
century as key players on the American national political stage?
Yes, if we leverage areas of commonality. </P>

<P>The Jewish lobby in the U.S. has a clear mission: to support
the policies of the elected Government of Israel no matter what,
right or wrong. The National Rifle Association (NRA) is also a
case in point of how simplicity and clarity of objectives translates
into political potency. </P>

<P>With Democrats taking a drubbing over Clinton's private indiscretions
and Gore's fundraising tactics, the next presidential election
promises to be a close one. Swing votes such as minority votes
or single-issue voting blocs can tilt the scale in one candidate's
favour. This upcoming presidential election could offer Arab and
Muslim Americans a chance to flex their fledgling political muscles.
</P>

<P>Typical of other Third World countries, Arab and Muslim States
are hardly united in their policies and outlook. But Arab and
Muslim communities in the diaspora have been wedded together by
outside forces. This unintentional coupling of &quot;causes&quot;
proved a very positive development to both communities. The almost
sudden doubling in numbers of voters espousing common issues has
been a cause of celebration for visionary leaders in both communities.
</P>

<P>Over the last decade, it has become apparent that both Arab
and Muslim Americans have been joined together by their unfortunate
circumstances and shared experiences in the U.S. The sense of
being besieged brought upon by negative media images, government-sponsored
civil rights violations, and gross double standards in U.S. foreign
policy have all but united many political objectives of both communities.</P>

<P>On the domestic policy front, the task of finding common grounds
is less complex. On civil rights, both communities seem to have
developed a solid consensus on key issues: end airport profiling,
secret evidence, and job discrimination. On social issues the
situation is a bit more complex. New immigrants tend to espouse
a conservative social agenda. The later generations of Arab and
Muslim Americans tend to shift towards the centre over time. </P>

<P>On foreign policy, more effort is needed to build a common
agenda. Arab and Muslim Americans have very diverse views on what
constitutes the ideal state of affairs in the Arab or Muslim world.
Those views include a pan-Islamic nation, secular pan-Arab nation,
Islamic pan-Arab nation, Greater Syria, Syria out of Lebanon,
Greater Jordan, Historical Palestine, 1967 Palestine, pro-Oslo,
anti-Oslo, Bi-National Israel, Islamic Palestine, Independent
Kashmir, Autonomous Kashmir within India, Pakistan-controlled
Kashmir, Islamic Bosnia, Secular Bosnia, Independent Kosovo, Autonomy
for Kosovo, pro-democratization, pro-status quo, and all the possible
permutations and combinations of the above positions and more.
</P>

<P>The Arab and Muslim communities have a hierarchy of issues.
At the top of the hierarchy are issues relating to justice at
home and justice abroad. Reduced taxes and interest rates, while
desirable, are lower on the totem pole of issues and fall in the
category of luxury not justice. </P>

<P>A realistic Arab-Muslim American agenda for the year 2000 may
read as follows: </P>

<P>1.	Support for lifting the sanctions against the Iraqi people
and respect for Iraq's territorial integrity.</P>

<P>2.	Support for United Nations resolutions on Kashmir.</P>

<P>3.	Support for United Nations resolutions on Israel including
the withdrawal from Palestine, Lebanon, and Syria to pre-1967
borders.</P>

<P>4.	Support for autonomy for Albanians in Kosovo.</P>

<P>5.	Support for the abolishment of the dubious &quot;secret
evidence&quot; in U.S. courts.</P>

<P>6.	Support for the abolishment of discriminatory &quot;airport
profiling&quot; practices based on appearances, names, religion,
or national origin.</P>

<P>7.	Support for democratic reforms and respect for human rights
in the Arab and Islamic world.</P>

<P>The above agenda, put together, resonates with the bulk of
mainstream Arabs and Muslims as well as the global community.
This agenda is rooted in fairness, international law; both are
values most voters don't have reasons to reject, thus reducing
the political risk to candidates. Candidates can then be judged
on their positions vis-&agrave;-vis our common issues. </P>

<P>Caveat emptor! Traditional coalition-busting tactics will entice
some candidates to selectively endorse one group's issues at the
expense of the other. Holding firm to the common agenda and promising
a candidate the full vote or no vote is the only policy against
the collapse of the coalition. </P>

<P>Oslo is a case in point of how catastrophic the results can
be when one player in the coalition, the Palestinian leadership,
breaks away from the team hoping to maximize its own gain with
little concern for the well-being of other partners. Today, the
sorry state of the &quot;peace&quot; process and the deplorable
conditions of the Palestinians speak volumes to the dangers of
coalition busting. For too long now, the Arab and Muslim grass
roots have held the Jewish lobby on a pedestal demanding our organizations
live up to the same level of excellence. Ironically, the same
grass roots have deprived their organizations of the needed ammunition
for success, also known as political realism and commitment in
money and time. </P>

<P>No, the U.S. will not leverage its resources to promote Arab
or Islamic unity. That's for Arabs and Muslims to pursue. And
no, the U.S. will not un-recognize Israel. And no, the U.S. will
not adopt Islam as the national religion. And no, the U.S. will
not outlaw certain lifestyles some in both communities don't approve
of. Extreme positions lead to self-imposed obsolescence, fast.
On the other hand, we can help shape U.S. foreign policy to promote
respect for human rights, respect for international law, and democratic
reforms which in turn can help citizens of the Arab and Islamic
world chart their own destiny. </P>

<P>The Jewish lobby's political maturity and efficiency was most
evident in the 180-degree flip they performed following the Likud
government's assumption of power. Known for its opposition to
Labor's land-for-peace formula, Likud quickly mobilized its lobbies
in the U.S. to win political support or neutrality for its campaign
to freeze or reverse Oslo. </P>

<P>Overnight, Jewish lobbyists in the U.S. who were recently holding
hands with their &quot;brave&quot; Arab comrades in peace while
smoking the peace pipe, are now decrying the policies of the Israeli
Labor as shortsighted and accusing the Palestinians of breaking
their end of the Oslo bargain at every turn. Therein lies the
power of the Jewish lobby: simplicity of objectives and commitment.
</P>

<P>Arab and Muslim lobbies in the U.S. draw upon a constituency
that is well-educated and well-financed. But with a missing realistic
and unifying agenda the impact has been less than optimum. This
can change if we abandon the impractical notion of the all-or-nothing
outlook to seeking common grounds. </P>

<P>Additionally, African Americans and civil libertarians have
also proved helpful to our cause. Progressive Christian American
organizations have also been a source of strength on the issue
of Palestine and Iraq. But the Arab-Muslim American alliance is
an instant coalition, just add water. And the potential for developing
this alliance into a viable voting-bloc is much greater than that
of any other group. </P>

<P>Separately, each community, and sub-groups within it, does
not project power on the political stage. Combined, a critical
mass is easily reached. Together, Arab and Muslim Americans total
from 6 to 8 million. The number of eligible voters within those
two communities, when perceived as one bloc, can help translate
our agenda into real justice, both home and abroad. </P>

<P>The year 2000 may spell doom and gloom for some. To Arabs of
all faiths and Muslims of various national origins living in America,
it could be a harbinger to a promising century of hope if they
leverage this very special partnership born of righteousness of
purpose. </P>

<H3><CENTER>Let it be Intifadah</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ramzy Baroud</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Holding signs that say &quot;jobs not jails&quot;, black youth
came from all over the United States to Harlem. They came to rally
for unity, hoping for a better tomorrow, in a gathering they called
the &quot;Million Youth March&quot;. <BR>
Believing that change comes from within, African American Muslim
leaders, such as Dr. Khalid Mohammed urged the young black men
and women to change the devastated destiny of their people with
their own hands. The message was loud, clear and hard to be misunderstood.
But the New York police, who had their own racist battles in the
past, chose to believe that the rally was an anti-Semitic angry
mob. Even though these claims were unfounded, the scene quickly
escalated to a bloody fight in which a total of 20 people were
wounded. <BR>
Dr. Khalid Mohammed, the emerging Black Muslim leader and the
head of the New Black Panthers Party, cried to the crowd to defend
themselves against the 3,000 police officers present. He cried,
&quot;If they put their hands on you, it's a God-given right to
defend yourselves&quot;.  Later he added, when he found that the
police were preventing the crowd from marching through the city,
&quot;each one of these bastards is holding a gun or maybe two
or three. Take their guns and beat the hell out of them&quot;.
<BR>
More than 20 years ago, with the same angry voice and words which
are still echoing in the streets of Harlem, Malcolm X declared,
&quot;If anyone touches you, don't turn the other cheek. Islam
is a loving religion but it also teaches you that if your enemy
puts his hand on you, send him to the cemetery&quot;. <BR>
The chapter on Black and White America has not yet been closed.
Some believe it's just starting.  <BR>
There are many similarities in the faces and the acts of the oppressor
and the oppressed, no matter where they are. Yet the similarities
in the nature of the struggle between the Palestinians and the
Blacks of Harlem is much more than a shared face of the oppressed.<BR>
&quot;Let it be Intifadah&quot;.  That slogan was a slogan used
by black demonstrators a few years ago when the New York police
opened fire on an angry crowd killing several of them. After a
few days of reporting the slogan, The New York Times reversed
its story by saying that the chant was actually &quot;Let it be
Auschwitz&quot;, referring to the Polish city in which Jews believe
that 3 million of their ancestors were killed during the Second
World War.<BR>
Guiliani, the Mayor of New York, ordered the removal of the Palestinian
leader Yasser Arafat from a concert in which he was invited to
attend last year in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of the
United Nations. He is the same Mayor who ordered 3,000 armed riot
police to prevent the Million Youth March from marching through
the city. Guiliani, who has just been re-elected, thanks to the
large sums of money received from Jewish donors, had very similar
explanations when asked about his behaviour. After the removal
of Arafat, he declared &quot;I just can't let a terrorist who
killed lots of Jews feel welcome in my city regardless of what
the White House thinks&quot;. In the second incident, he uttered
&quot;I knew that the rally was going to turn into an anti Jewish
hate gathering&quot;. <BR>
In each and every pro-Arab demonstration, one can't help noticing
several or many black Americans named Ali, Abdullah or any other
Arab name, chanting with support for the people in which they
believe they once belonged and still belong to. <BR>
When the American Muslim martyr, Malcolm X visited the Arab world
for the first time, he announced upon his return, &quot;I am no
longer 'X', my last name is 'Shabazz'. I finally found my roots
and I know who my true people are&quot;. <BR>
The sense of belonging, solidarity and brotherhood between African
Americans, Arabs and Muslims elsewhere has always existed. Yet,
this closeness was always viewed cautiously and often angrily
by the American Government and media. A few months back, when
the leader of the Nation of Islam conducted his first trip to
the Arab world, many angry voices cried out from the Congress
calling for his imprisonment. Louis Farrakhan's final destination
was to be the Aqsa Mosque. The American Muslim leader had to change
his plans in a heartbeat once he received uncountable threats
on his life from the Jews of the city. <BR>
Harlem, the city that embraced the latest effort by black youth
in their fight for human rights, was the battle stage for many
efforts during the last several decades. Malcolm X was assassinated
while defending the former slaves whom he called the &quot;Field
Negroes&quot;. Now, new leaders are emerging, picking up the flag
to fight for the same cause, including his own grandson, Malik
Shabazz Malcolm X. <BR>
Even though it sounds far away, the fight for dignity and freedom
has extended from Jerusalem to Harlem. The same picture repeats
itself. The racist mayors and the bloodthirsty police who are
always there to protect the interests of the rich and powerful.
<BR>
...And as always, a little boy, black or brown, will appear from
the middle of the crowd holding a sign, or a flag. With an angry
voice and waving hands, he will shout, &quot;Let it be Intifadah&quot;.</P>

<H3><CENTER>The Dispensations</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>By Israel Shahak<BR>
<BR>
2.</B> The sabbatical year. According to talmudic law (based on
Leviticus 25) Jewish-owned land in Palestine must be left fallow
every seventh ('sabbatical') year, when all agricultural work
(including harvesting) on such land is forbidden. There is ample
evidence that this law was rigorously observed for about one thousand
years, from the 5th century BC till the disappearance of Jewish
agriculture in Palestine. Later, when there was no occasion to
apply the law in practice, it was kept theoretically intact. However,
in the 1880s, with the establishment of the first Jewish agricultural
colonies in Palestine, it became a matter of practical concern.
Rabbis sympathetic to the settlers helpfully devised a dispensation,
which was later perfected by their successors in the religious
zionist parties and has become an established Israeli practice.</P>

<P>	This is how it works. Shortly before a sabbatical year, the
Israeli Minister of Internal Affairs gives the Chief Rabbi a document
making him the legal owner of all Israeli land, both private and
public. Armed with this paper, the Chief Rabbi goes to a non-Jew
and sells him all the land of Israel (and, since 1967, the Occupied
Territories) for a nominal sum. A separate document stipulates
that the 'buyer' will 'resell' the land back after the year is
over. And this transaction is repeated every seven years, usually
with the same 'buyer'.</P>

<P>Non-zionist rabbis_do not recognize the validity of this dispensation,
claiming correctly that, since religious law forbids Jews to sell
land in Palestine to Gentiles, the whole transaction is based
on a sin and hence null and void. The zionist rabbis reply, however,
that what is forbidden is a real sale, not a fictitious one!</P>

<P><B>3. </B>Milking on the sabbath. This has been forbidden in
post-talmudic times, through the process of increasing religious
severity mentioned above. The ban could easily be kept in the
diaspora, since Jews who had cows of their own were usually rich
enough to have non-Jewish servants, who could be ordered (using
one of the subterfuges described below) to do the milking. The
early Jewish colonists in Palestine employed Arabs for this and
other purposes, but with the forcible imposition of the zionist
policy of exclusive Jewish labour there was need for a dispensation.
(This was particularly important before the introduction of mechanised
milking in the late 1950s.) Here too there was a difference between
zionist and non-zionist rabbis.</P>

<P>	According to the former, the forbidden milking becomes permitted
provided the milk is not white but dyed blue. This blue Saturday
milk is then used exclusively for making cheese, and the dye is
washed off into the whey. Non-zionist rabbis have devised a much
subtler scheme (which I personally witnessed operating in a religious
kibbutz in 1952). They discovered an old provision which allows
the udders of a cow to be emptied on the sabbath, purely for relieving
the suffering caused to the animal by bloated udders, and on the
strict condition that the milk runs to waste on the ground. Now,
this is what is actually done: on Saturday morning, a pious kibbutznik
goes to the cowshed and places pails under the cows. (There is
no ban on such work in the whole of the talmudic literature.)
He then goes to the synagogue to pray. Then comes his colleague,
whose 'honest intention' is to relieve the animals' pain and let
their milk run to the floor. But if, by chance, a pail happens
to be standing there, is he under any obligation to remove it?
Of course not. He simply 'ignores' the pails, fulfills his mission
of mercy and goes to the synagogue. Finally a third pious colleague
goes into the cowshed and discovers, to his great surprise, the
pails full of milk. So he puts them in cold storage and follows
his comrades to the synagogue. Now all is well, and there is no
need to waste money on blue dye.</P>

<P><B>4. </B>Mixed crops. Similar dispensations were issued by
zionist rabbis in respect of the ban (based on Leviticus, 19:19)
against sowing two different species of crop in the same field.
Modern agronomy has however shown that in some cases ( especially
in growing fodder) mixed sowing is the most profitable. The rabbis
invented a dispensation according to which one man sows the field
lengthwise with one kind of seed, and later that day his comrade,
who 'does not know' about the former, sows another kind of seed
crosswise. However, this method was felt to be too wasteful of
labour, and a better one was devised: one man makes a heap of
,one kind of seed in a public place and carefully covers it with
a sack or piece of board. The second kind of seed is then put
on top of the cover. Later, another man comes and exclaims, in
front of witnesses, 'I need this sack (or board)' and removes
it, so that the seeds mix 'naturally'. Finally, a third man comes
along and is told, 'Take this and sow the field,' which he proceeds
to do.</P>

<P><B>5. </B>Leavened substances must not be eaten or even kept
in the possession of a Jew during the seven (or, outside Palestine,
eight) days of Passover. The concept 'leavened substances' was
continually broadened and the aversion to so much as seeing them
during the festival approached hysteria. They include all kinds
of flour and even unground grain. In the original talmudic society
this was bearable, because bread (leavened or not) was usually
baked once a week; a peasant family would use the last of the
previous year's grain to bake unleavened bread for the festival,
which ushers in the new harvest season. However, in the conditions
of post-Talmudic European Jewry the observance was very hard on
a middle-class Jewish family and even more so on a corn merchant.
A dispensation was therefore devised, by which all those substances
are sold in a fictitious sale to a Gentile before the festival
and bought back automatically after it. The one thing that must
be done is to lock up the taboo substances for the duration of
the festival. In Israel this fictitious sale has been made more
efficient. Religious Jews 'sell' their leavened substances to
their local rabbis, who in turn 'sell' them to the Chief Rabbis;
the latter sell them to a Gentile, and by a special dispensation
this sale is presumed to include also the leavened substances
of non-practising Jews.</P>

<P><B>6. </B>Sabbath-Goy. Perhaps the most developed dispensations
concern the 'Goy (Gentile) of Sabbath'. As mentioned above, the
range of tasks banned on the sabbath has widened continually;
but the range of tasks that must be carried out or supervised
to satisfy needs or to increase comfort also keeps widening. This
is particularly true in modern times, but the effect of technological
change began to be felt long ago. The ban against grinding on
the sabbath was a relatively light matter for a Jewish peasant
or artisan, say in second-century Palestine, who used a hand mill
for domestic purposes. It was quite a different matter for a tenant
of a water mill or windmill -one of the most common Jewish occupations
in eastern Europe. But even such a simple human 'problem' as the
wish to have a hot cup of tea on a Saturday afternoon becomes
much greater with the tempting samovar, used regularly on weekdays,
standing in the room. These are just two examples out of a very
large number of so-called 'problems of Sabbath observance'. And
one can state with certainty that for a community composed exclusively
of Orthodox Jews they were quite insoluble, at least during the
last eight or ten centuries, without the 'help' of non-Jews. This
is even more true today in the 'Jewish state', because many public
services, such as water, gas and electricity, fall in this category.
Classical Judaism could not exist even for a whole week without
using some non-Jews.</P>

<P>But without special dispensations there is a great obstacle
in employing non-Jews to do these Saturday jobs; for talmudic
regulations forbid Jews to ask a Gentile to do on the sabbath
any work which they themselves are banned from doing. I shall
describe two of the many types of dispensation used for such purposes.</P>

<P>First, there is the method of 'hinting', which depends on the
casuistic logic according to which a sinful demand becomes blameless
if it is phrased slyly. As rule, the hint must be 'obscure', but
in cases of extreme need a 'clear' hint is allowed. For example,
in a recent booklet on religious observance for the use of Israeli
soldiers, the latter are taught how to talk to Arab workers employed
by the army as sabbath-Goyim. In urgent cases, such as when it
is very cold and a fire must be lit, or when light is needed for
a religious service, a pious Jewish soldier may use a 'clear'
hint and tell the Arab: 'It is cold (or dark) here'. But normally
an 'obscure' hint must suffice, for example: 'It would be more
pleasant if it were warmer here.' This method of 'hinting' is
particularly repulsive and degrading inasmuch as it is normally
used on non-Jews who, due to their poverty or subordinate social
position, are wholly in the power of their Jewish employer. A
Gentile servant (or employee of the Israeli army) who does not
train himself to interpret 'obscure hints' as orders will be pitilessly
dismissed.</P>

<P>The second method is used in cases where what the Gentile is
required to do on Saturday is not an occasional task or personal
service, which can be 'hinted' at as the need arises, but a routine
or regular job without constant Jewish supervision. According
to this method - called 'implicit inclusion' (havla'ah) of the
sabbath among weekdays - the Gentile is hired 'for the whole week
(or year)', without the sabbath being so much as mentioned in
the contract. But in reality work is only performed on the sabbath.
This method was used in the past in hiring a Gentile to put out
the candles in the synagogue after the sabbath-eve prayer (rather
than wastefully allowing them to burn out). Modern Israeli examples
are: regulating the water supply or watching over water reservoirs
on Saturdays.</P>

<P>A similar idea is used also in the case of Jews, but for a
different end. Jews are forbidden to receive any payment for work
done on the sabbath, even if the work itself is permitted. The
chief example here concerns the sacred professions: the rabbi
or talmudic scholar who preaches or teaches on the sabbath, the
cantor who sings only on Saturdays and other holy days (on which
similar bans apply), the sexton and similar officials. In talmudic
times, and in some countries even several centuries after, such
jobs were unpaid. But later, when these became salaried professions,
the dispensation of 'implicit inclusion' was used, and they were
hired on a 'monthly' or 'yearly' basis. In the case of rabbis
and talmudic scholars the problem is particularly complicated,
because the Talmud forbids them to receive any payment for preaching,
teaching or studying talmudic matters even on weekdays. For them
an additional dispensation stipulates that their salary is not
really a salary at all but 'compensation for idleness' (dmey batalah).
As a combined result of these two fictions, what is in reality
payment for work done mainly, or even solely, on the sabbath is
transmogrified into payment for being idle on weekdays.</P>

<P><CENTER><B>By E. Yaghi</B></CENTER></P>

<P><CENTER><I>Say not the struggle nought availeth,<BR>
The labour and the wounds are vain,<BR>
The enemy faints not, nor faileth,<BR>
And as things have been they remain.</I></CENTER></P>

<P>(<B><I>Taken from: &quot;Say Not the Struggle Nought Availeth&quot;,
by Arthur Hugh Clough</I></B>)</P>

<P>Twenty-three-year old Sherine looked out the window of her
stone house in a part of Hebron which is still under Israeli occupation
five years after the signing of the Oslo accords.  As far as she
could see, nothing had really changed except for the fact that
she had married and now had a set of triplets three months old
to keep her frantically busy. However, as far as freedom goes,
things were as bad as ever.</P>

<P>The olive tree that silhouetted the shadows of the evening
still guarded her home, and the nocturnal moon still hung in the
deep dark blue of evening.  The stars still blinked like bright
candles as she fed Qusai, one of the triplets.  &quot;My beautiful
son, I love you in the sunshine, I love you in the night and my
darling, you can tell any dream to me though your dreams are never
free.&quot;</P>

<P>The infant's brothers were sleeping, but for some reason Qusai
was restless and though the wonders of the cool summer night were
yet beyond him, the baby's eyes were wide and bright, as bright
as the evening stars.</P>

<P>Sherine smoothed his small bib and ran her hand over the newly
sprouting short crop of golden locks that crowned his perfect
head.  She then whispered in his ear, &quot;Truly, you are the
most beautiful baby I have ever seen, even more beautiful than
your brothers.  Now, it is time for you to go to sleep.  Tomorrow's
another day and I need my rest to keep up with the three of you.
 Come, my darling, I will rock you and sing you lullabies and
you will sleep.&quot;</P>

<P>So she sat there, next to the window of her stone house, the
infant cradled in her arms, singing the lullabies that had been
sung to her when she was tiny like her son.  In spite of the cool,
seemingly calm of the evening, the curfew gave Sherine a feeling
of helplessness and dread.  At last, her tiny child slept and
she placed him on a small mat near his two other brothers.  Were
her triplets born in some other country where there is a semblance
of peace and happiness, she might have been provided with gifts
of clothes, diapers and food to help ease the financial strain
of three infants at one time, but as things were, she and her
husband had to make do with the money that trickled in from the
small store he ran.  </P>

<P>The next day, with the coming of dawn, a shaft of light filled
the triplets' room with a glint of hope.  Near the old olive tree,
the sun climbed slowly in the sky, so slowly, but as Sherine glanced
out of her window on the world, towards the west, the land was
bright.  The cries of her three babies broke the stillness of
the early morning.  She fixed their bottles and ran to them, singing
and dancing.  Her husband went off to do his duty by his three
tiny infants and his wife crooned, bathed and sang to her sons
as she propped in each mouth the first warm milk of the day. 
</P>

<P>&quot;What's wrong my angel Qusai?  You don't look too well
today.  Come on, drink your milk and you'll be ok.  Just this
morning your daddy said that he was a fool because of what he
had learned at school.  He should at least have gone to college
and got a little ampler knowledge but poverty determines lots
of things.  So he must do as he likes and so must you, and remember,
if work's a cheat, so's pleasure.  Nothing's new and nothing's
true.&quot;  </P>

<P>She picked up the child.  His skin, usually pink and rosy looked
faded and he wrinkled his little face and cried out against the
injustice, the curfew, the occupation and the frustrations of
his young mother and father.  Where would it all end?  She kissed
his soft angelic cheek and said, &quot;We'll hold our fancy like
a screen, us and the dreadful fact between.  And it shall yet
be long, aye long, the quiet notes of our low song shall keep
us for that sad dong, dong.  Hark, hark, hark! O voice of fear!
 It reaches us here, even here!&quot;</P>

<P>And not too far from the window of her stone house, Israeli
soldiers marched with their heavy iron boots and bodies wet from
the sweat of all the ammunition they carried.  Ammunition to blow
up houses and women and children.  Ammunition to fight infants
like Qusai.  And to the upset baby in her arms, Sherine chanted,
&quot;Do not worry my darling.  The good are weak, the wicked
strong, and O my God, how long, how long?&quot;</P>

<P>Her day was busier than ever and the sun climbed that day in
the sky, slowly, rigidly.  It was more than she could do to keep
up with her triplets and it weighed heavily on her mind that Qusai
was fretful and lethargic.  And then it happened, later on that
same day, towards evening, when Hebron smelled like dank musk
and wild doves had settled in their nests, Qusai began to vomit
while Sherine was changing his diaper.  She swept the infant up
in her arms, leaving his identical brothers to the care of her
mother and rushed out of her stone home, past the olive tree,
past the grape vines to the barbed wire of Israeli sentries. 
She was heading towards Hebron's Alia hospital a 10-minute drive
away.  But the curfew was in force in the Israeli-occupied part
of Hebron, the part where Sherine lived.  </P>

<P>She swallowed the lump of fear in her throat and approached
the soldiers at the checkpoint.  Two military jeeps stood nearby.
 &quot;Where are you going?&quot; one of the soldiers gruffly
asked the girl. </P>

<P>She mustered all her courage for she couldn't help but notice
the guns, the ammunition, the thick army boots and the snarling
faces of the Israeli soldiers and showing them tiny Qusai, said,
&quot;I'm going to the hospital because my baby's very sick.&quot;</P>

<P>Sounds of steel came from the stern sentry's mouth as his lips
formed the words, &quot;You can't go, there's a curfew.  We have
no orders to let you pass.&quot;</P>

<P>She was frantic, almost panicky, and she felt that every second
being wasted was now a matter of life and death for her tiny son.
 Again, she pulled courage from deep within her and stated, &quot;I
want to return home.&quot;</P>

<P>&quot;Wait here!&quot;</P>

<P>Her heart pounded as heavily as the sun had climbed the Hebron
sky earlier that day and when she saw the soldiers busy themselves
with a group of Palestinians, Sherine disappeared into the vineyard
and walked to the hospital, clutching infant Qusai close to her
warm body.  She walked for 40 minutes until she reached a Palestinian
roadblock where she hailed a taxi.</P>

<P>Her heart began to beat a thousand beats a minute and beads
of sweat rolled down her face as she nearly screamed to the driver,
&quot;Faster, faster!&quot;  When Qusai made a gurgling sound
and stopped breathing, she was within minutes of the hospital
and when the taxi stopped abruptly, she jumped out, ran to the
emergency room with her now dead baby, hoping there was still
a chance to save his life.  It was too late.</P>

<P>After the tragedy, Sherine later told reporters, &quot;Qusai
was a complete innocent, the most beautiful baby I have ever seen.
 If I saw the soldiers again I would tell them, you Jews have
children just like we have.  Why did you do this to me?&quot;</P>

<P><CENTER><I>Over the rolling waters go,<BR>
Come from the dying moon, and blow,<BR>
Blow him again to me;<BR>
While my little one, my pretty one, sleeps. </I> <B>(Alfred Lord
Tennyson)</B></CENTER></P>

<P>Qusai's infant soul was borne on the wings of angels to a far,
far better place where there is no hatred, no war, no injustice
and no Oslo accords that were signed by traitors and Zionists.

<H3><CENTER>The Neo-Crusaders</CENTER></H3>

<P><CENTER><B>By Ruth Anderson</B></CENTER></P>

<P>In the form of missionary schools or language centres, or even
in covert efforts to have paid informants in miserable refugee
camps which contain the hopelessness and despair of the Palestinian
people, the neo-crusaders carry on century-old campaigns to either
convert Muslims to Christianity or to corrupt and Westernize them.<BR>
Throughout the Middle East these modern-day crusaders are at work
and often act as agents for the CIA while they pillage and plunder
the remaining riches of an area once abundant with mineral and
natural resources.<BR>
The first Crusades were military expeditions undertaken by Western
European powers at the request of the pope to &quot;recover&quot;
Jerusalem and other Palestinian places, known as the Holy Land,
from Muslim control.  The Crusades provided an area of expansion
that coincided with the growth of European population and commercial
activity.  They also offered an outlet for the ambitions of land-hungry
knights and noblemen. Thus, many went on the Crusades out of greed.
 <BR>
The Crusades formally began on Tuesday, 27 November 1095 outside
the French city of Clermont-Ferrand when Pope Urban II delivered
a sermon to crowds of people attending a church council at Clermont.
 The Pope then outlined a plan for a Crusade and called on his
listeners to join forces. Five major armies of noblemen assembled
in the summer of 1096 to set out on the Crusade.  Though the majority
were from France, there were forces of significant numbers from
southern Italy and also from Lorraine, Burgundy and Flanders.<BR>
The armies of the Crusaders arrived at Constantinople, now Istanbul,
Turkey, between November 1096 and May 1097.  In May 1097, the
Crusaders attacked and conquered the Anatolian Turkish capital
at Nicaea.  After this, they went on to the city of Antioch in
northern Syria and besieged it.  <BR>
In November 1098, the Crusaders set out to capture Jerusalem.
It is interesting to note that under the rule of the Muslims,
followers of the three monotheistic faiths were free to worship
as they pleased.  On the evening of 7 June, the Crusaders camped
within sight of Jerusalem's walls.  At this time, the city was
under Egyptian control.  Jerusalem was taken by storm on 15 July.
 Nearly every inhabitant of the city was massacred and the city
ran red with the blood of Muslims.  It must be said that the victories
of the First Crusade were due to the isolation and weakness of
the Muslim powers.  However, within the next generation, the Muslims
reunified under the leadership of Imad ad-Din Zenki, who was ruler
of Mosul and Aleppo.  Under Zenki, the Muslim forces systematically
dismantled the Crusader State in the region.<BR>
Zenki's successor, Nur ad-Din, was able to expand his power in
the Middle East while the Crusaders regrouped.  In 1169 his forces
under Saladin took control of Egypt.  With the death of Zenki,
Saladin became ruler of a Muslim State that encompassed the region
from the Libyan Desert to the Tigris Valley, and in May 1187,
Saladin finally was able to invade the kingdom of Jerusalem. 
On 2 October, Jerusalem surrendered to Saladin's Muslim forces.<BR>
Later Crusades tried unsuccessfully to recapture the city of Jerusalem.
 Two centuries of Crusades left little positive impact on Syria
and Palestine except for castles, churches and forts left behind
by the Crusaders, along with the initial carnage of pillage and
plunder.  But the principal effects of the Crusades were felt
in Europe, not the Middle East.  The Crusades had bolstered the
commerce of Italian cities and established trade markets.<BR>
Again, the Muslim and Arab world is divided and now the rampant
virus of imperialism and neo-colonialism in the New World Disorder
seeps invisible and unseen into every corner and every household
like the Black Death.  The neo-Crusaders (some of whom think they
are the elite members of their self-proclaimed God-squad and will
sit in the front row on the day of Armageddon), are still out
to pillage and plunder with either the Cheshire hypocritical cat
smile (with their steely knives behind their backs ready to plunge
into the hearts and minds of the innocents) or with an air of
arrogance.  The sad thing is that often they are successful and
have helped the alienation of Arabs and Muslims from traditions,
morals and religion that once prevented a considerable amount
 of evil and thwarted the first Crusades.  The neo-Crusaders pose
an even greater threat than the first attempts to Westernize and
Christianize the Middle East, but if the Arabs and Muslims remain
divided and governed by greedy, selfish and ruthless rulers, evil
will win and weakness will lose. <BR>
The best examples of the neo-Crusaders are the Gulf war, the subsequent
sanctions imposed on Iraq, the civil war in Lebanon, the civil
strife in Sudan, the occupation of Palestine and the subsequent
Diaspora of the Palestinian people, the Iraq-Iran war, and the
now impending crisis between Iranian forces and the Taleban in
Afghanistan.  </P>
