<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">An Arab intifada is needed</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second Palestinian uprising is likely to continue for a long time to
come, despite the Nazi-like tactics used by the Israeli army and settlers to repress
Palestinian protests.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it seems clear that stopping the uprising now would be an act of
national suicide and a huge political blunder for the Palestinian people. This is so
because the only alternative to the uprising that is being offered to the Palestinian
people by the Zionist regime and the American administration is the return to the
pointless haggling and hapless disgusting talks between Arafat and the arrogant Zionist
establishment, intoxicated by the Zionists&#146; virtual control over the American
government and its decision-making process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Stopping the uprising, God forbid, would be national suicide for the
Palestinians because the Zionist regime would then be justified in claiming that
resistance to Zionist arrogance and hegemony was futile and therefore the Palestinian
people would have no choice but to succumb to Israeli-American dictates.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Besides, it should be made clear to all that the current intifada is not
aimed at enhancing the negotiating stance of the Palestinian Authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the intifada is a clarion protest against the Oslo process in its
entirety. It is also an indirect vote of no-confidence in the gullible Palestinian
leadership that embraced Oslo, clung to it for so long and, even when the &#147;other
side&#148; turned its back to it, acted as &#147;indigenous collaborator&#148; with the
enemy against dignified Palestinian patriots who said &#147;no&#148; to the sell-out of
Palestinian rights under the false rubric of &#147;peace.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The current intifada underscores the fragility and artificiality of the
Palestinian Authority&#146;s structure. A few months ago, Arafat and his acolytes,
hangers-on and mouthpieces repeatedly claimed that the Palestinian people were already
&#147;embodying Statehood on the ground and exercising sovereignty.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, with the Israeli occupation soldiers tearing this non-existent State
and its fictitious sovereignty to shreds, it is obvious that Arafat and company were
deceiving the Palestinian people as well as Arab and Muslim masses around the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But These lies were understandable in a certain sense. Arafat and Oslo
were two sides of the same coin, and for him to come to terms with the ugly realities of
Oslo would amount to admitting guilt. But Arafat, as everybody knows, would never admit
guilt because &#147;he is always right and everybody else is wrong.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several Palestinian officials, encouraged or prompted by the popular
uprising, have of late recognized publicly that Oslo was either dead or on the verge of
death. We hope their prognosis is accurate, because if it is not, our collective
disappointment and outrage, as Palestinians, would be very profound.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moving out of the confines of the Palestinian sphere, we saw that the
uprising already galvanized much of the Arab world. For the first time in many years, Arab
masses, thirsty for freedom and democracy, were able to take to the streets to vent their
frustration and rage and to voice their boiling anger at Zionist-ruled America, the real
tormentor of the Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That was fine, but the Arab world, Palestine and al-Masjidul Aqsa need
more of this positive movement on the part of the long-repressed masses. In fact, the
Palestinian uprising could succeed only if backed up and nourished by the Arab and Muslim
masses all over the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This movement by the masses would almost certainly eventually lead up to
&#147;friction&#148; with the despotic rulers and their respective machines of repression,
as it already happened in two or three Arab countries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So be it. Everyone must understand that the Arab-Muslim public opinion is
determined to make its voice heard on behalf of Jerusalem and al-Masjidul Aqsa.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This historical task is not going to be easy by any means, but once the
&#147;psychological barrier&#148; is broken, and it is being broken, the masses should be
able to take to the streets freely and demonstrate outside the American embassies to the
convey one message which is&#148; that there can be no further coexistence between the
blood of Palestinian children, shed by American-supplied weaponry, and American interests
in the Arab world.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist-controlled America will most certainly then pressure the
obsequious and embarrassed governments to stop the &#147;riots&#148; and &#147;re-instate
law and order&#148; and &#147;maintain stability in this volatile region.&#148; And the
governments would certainly and quickly move to suppress the people&#133;and probably
hundreds, maybe thousands, would be arrested and tortured&#133;all on behalf of the White
House and its organ-grinder, AIPAC.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, so what. This would be the price for freedom, and nobody would be so
naïve as to expect the Arabs and Muslims to regain their dignity and human rights without
sacrifices.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, mobilizing and galvanizing the Arab-Muslim masses against the US
policies should be a central goal of the current intifada in Palestine.</p>

<p>The U.S. is, after all, the Palestinians&#146; ultimate tormentor.</p>
