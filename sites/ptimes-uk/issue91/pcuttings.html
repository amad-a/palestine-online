Hamas founder Sheikh Ahmed Yassin was released yesterday from
two months  of house arrest in his Gaza home, and immediately
went to pray in a  nearby mosque.<br>
Tomorrow is the final day of the ultimatum presented by Iz a Din
al  Kassam, the military wing of the Hamas, for Yassin's release.<br>
Speaking to reporters in his house yesterday, Yassin declared
the Wye  accord a failure, and said his release was a sign of
that.<br>
&quot;At the time that Wye was signed, the intent was to prove
that no voice  was higher that that of Wye,&quot; he said. &quot;Today,
after the sound of Wye  has become inaudible, it is inevitable
that other voices will become  audible.&quot; <br>
Yassin added that Hamas' fundamental beliefs had not changed.
Our pact  with God is more important ... We will hold on to our
strategy,&quot; he  said.</p>

Muslim guerrillas in Lebanon fired Katyusha rockets into  Israel
Wednesday, wounding 13 people. The attack was retaliation for
the  killing of a Lebanese woman and six of her children in an
Israeli  bombing raid on suspected guerrilla targets on Tuesday..
<br>
Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai expressed regret, saying
the  deaths were accidental. An army spokesman said the family's
house had  been hit by mistake in an air strike aimed at a Hezbollah
training base  and communications station near Janta in the Bekaa.
<br>
The Israeli Army chief of staff, Lt. Gen. Shaul Mofaz, said in
a  television interview that a pilot's &quot;incorrect target
identification&quot;  had caused the bombing error.</p>

With Israel now on its way to early elections, the most interesting
wild card in the contest may turn out to be the  Palestinians.In
the campaign for prime minister in 1996, Palestinian militants
played  a major role in Binyamin Netanyahu's come-from-behind,
upset victory. A  series of Palestinian suicide bombs three months
before the election  provided a critical boost for Netanyahu and
his view that Israel had to  get tough and slow down the peace
process. So it was not by chance that on Monday, when Netanyahu
rose in the  Israeli parliament to deliver what amounted to his
first campaign  speech, he spent most of his time attacking the
Palestinians, not his  domestic adversaries on the left and right.</p>

1998</font></b><br>
A day after Israel's parliament gave initial approval  to a measure
that would dissolve the government and trigger general  elections
in the first half of next year, the campaign season opened  abruptly
with a new challenge to Prime Minister Binyamin Netanyahu. A pillar
of Netanyahu's ruling Likud party, Dan Meridor, announced that
 he would form a centrist party and oppose Netanyahu in the race
for  prime minister. And the latest of several opinion polls showed
Netanyahu  starting the race behind his presumed main rivals --
including a former  army chief of staff who has yet to announce
any political plans.</p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#0000ff">The Financial Times, December 22 1998</font></b><br>
The Middle East peace process faces months of delay after Israel's
 parliament last night voted overwhelmingly to dissolve itself
and call  new elections, putting an end to the divided government
of Benjamin  Netanyahu. After intense debates and last-minute
efforts to form a  government of national unity, 81 of the 120
MPs in the Knesset voted for  early elections. Thirty were opposed,
four abstained and five were  absent. The decision means further
implementation of the Wye peace accord with  the Palestinians
will be on hold until at least the spring. A committee  will meet
next week to decide the date of the poll, which could be any 
time within the next several months.</p>

<p><b><font COLOR="#0000ff">The Guardian, December 15, 1998 </font></b><br>
 When the crucial moment came for the Palestinian National Council
to  affirm its renunciation of violence against Israel - the main
diplomatic  prize Mr Clinton had come for - even hardened veterans
of the long  guerilla war vied with each other to raise their
hands highest. Mr Clinton seized the moment. The council, he said
had sent &quot;a powerful  message, not to the government, but
to the people of Israel. You will  touch people on the streets
there. You will reach their hearts there.&quot;<br>
Clinton gets his historic show of hands <br>
