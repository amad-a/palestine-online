<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Expulsion: Israel&#146;s ultimate strategy toward
the Palestinian people</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Israel&#148; is facing a real predicament that is bound to
exacerbate with the passage of time. This predicament is nothing other than the mere
physical existence in Palestine of a significant mass of human-beings who happen not to
possess the &#147;right blood cells!&#148; It is the Palestinians, who, to the
Zionists&#146; dismay, doggedly continue to cling to their ancestral homeland and just
won&#146;t go away for the sake of &#147;God&#146;s chosen people,&#148; despite the
latter&#146;s enduring torment and persecution of the former.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionism has always been about uprooting Palestinians and bringing in Jews
from around the world to usurp their homes, farms and land. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the success of Zionism has always been and will continue to be
measured in proportion to the number of Jews brought into Palestine and how much land is
grabbed from the Palestinians&#150;the rightful owners of the land&#150;to fulfil the
Zionist dream.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Zionism, like its ideological sister, Nazism, is an exclusionist
fascist movement that believes in &#147;final solutions,&#148; and a final solution in
Palestine from the Zionist viewpoint must necessarily involve the complete or
semi-complete extirpation of Palestinians from their homeland.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is upsetting Zionist plans and calculations is that 120 years of
Zionism and 53 years of Statehood has evidently failed to achieve &#147;Jewish
exclusivity&#148; on the ground in Palestine, despite all the terrible terror and
bloodshed by the Zionists against Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, the continued &#147;onerous presence&#148; of so many Palestinians
(about 4.5 million) in Palestine is therefore viewed as Zionism&#146;s strategic nightmare
that will continue to be around for many, many years to come.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But why wouldn&#146;t Jews and Palestinians live together in a democratic,
civil State where everybody is treated as a &#147;citizen?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, Zionism doesn&#146;t understand this human language and is
intrinsically unwilling to treat non-Jews as fully human, much less equal to Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Zionist thinkers who met recently in Hertzilya in northern Palestine
to discuss the &#147;demographic problem&#148; had the audacity to suggest the
&#147;Judaization&#148; of a great number of Palestinians as a partial solution to the
&#147;problem.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Others, like strategic expert Shlomo Gazit, went as far as suggesting
forcible sterilization of Palestinian men and women for the purpose of controlling the
Palestinian birth rate and therefore maintaining numerical Jewish superiority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, others whose view was apparently dominant, reportedly argued,
unflinchingly and unhesitatingly, that the ultimate final solution to the Palestinian
problem ought to be the physical expulsion of most or even all of the Arabs from &#147;the
land of Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this effectively Nazi view, for the time being, expressed in
euphemistic language and played in quiet tones, is no longer the monopoly of fringe
fascist groups such as Rahbam Zevi&#146;s Moledet party or Jewish neo-Nazi groups like
Kahana Hay, Kach, and the Temple Mouth Faithful, etc.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Hebrew press, a solid majority of Israeli Jews today see
&#147;expulsion&#148; as the ultimate solution to the Palestinian problem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the present Zionist government, headed by certified war criminal
Ariel Sharon, holds a firm belief in &#147;the expulsion option,&#148; and it is only for
public relations expediency that Sharon, Liberman and others do not spell out their
beliefs to that effect publicly. &#147;It is extremely difficult to believe in Zionism and
not to believe in the expulsion option,&#148; said Zevi recently.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, it is increasingly clear that the two-State
solution&#150;whereby a Palestinian State would be established in the West Bank and Gaza
Strip&#150;is becoming a non-option, given the intensive proliferation of Jewish
settlements in the territories occupied in 1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact of the matter is that there is no room left for a Palestinian
State on the West Bank that is worth the name&#133;that is unless Yasser Arafat would
agree to have a humpty-dumpty kind of State!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, the Zionist regime would never agree to incorporate
four or five million Palestinians into Israel, since their inclusion would eventually
alter the identity of Israel as a &#147;State for the Jews,&#148; &#147;not for all of its
citizens,&#148; as other States are.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And since the present condition of occupation and apartheid is not
sustainable forever, Israel will sooner or later face either of two options: the
dissolution of the racist structure of Israel&#150;in short, declaring the end of
Zionism&#150;or mass expulsion of non-Jews from Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But what the Zionists don&#146;t realize is that even the expulsion of
Palestinians won&#146;t end the problem. It would rather complicate it further and further
in ways unimaginable now.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In any case, it is extremely vital that Palestinians, Arabs and Muslims in
this region be adequately prepared to face and thwart Zionist designs to that effect which
are real and must be taken seriously.</p>
