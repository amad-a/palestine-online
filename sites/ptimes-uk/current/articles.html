</o:p>
</span></i></b></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><b>&nbsp;</b>If body language were a reflection of beliefs
and personal psyche, few would ever trust President Bush’s ‘vision’ of a
Palestinian State. Never known for his eloquence, he searched, unsuccessfully,
for words to speak about the Palestinian State, throwing his arms around in
frantic motion before a world audience on 2 October 2000. When he referred to
Israel’s right to exist, Bush was noticeably coherent, confident and certain;
there were no slips of the tongue, wild gestures, or waffles. After all,
Israel’s right to exist is an article of faith and it must be affirmed with
conviction.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Despite the inelegance of the performance, many in
the Arab world were quick to oblige. Like their predecessors who joined the
Allied war effort in 1915 following a British promise of independence, they
called for everything but an end to the Aqsa Intifada and enlistment in the
American-led coalition against international terrorism. As did occur so many
times in the past, they forgot even their most recent history and the Letter of
Assurances written by James Baker on the eve of the Madrid Conference that
“the United States has opposed and will continue to oppose settlement activity
in the territories occupied in 1967, which remains an obstacle to peace.” If
the U.S. had effectively opposed the settlement activity, as it promised, why
was there a 52% growth in the population and size of Israeli settlements in the
territories after Oslo?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Across the Atlantic, Britain’s Prime Minister was,
as ever, more circumspect than his American counterpart. Speaking on the same
day at his Labour Party’s annual convention, Blair chose instead to mention an
undefined ‘justice’ for the Palestinians. His was a nebulous usage that was
reminiscent of the Balfour Declaration which refused to acknowledge the
Palestinian national identity and promised, instead, “that nothing shall be
done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine.”</p>
<p><b>&nbsp;</b><u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><b>The real victims</b><br>
</span></u><span style="font-size: 12.0pt; font-weight: normal">Having declared
that ‘justice’ for the Palestinians is part of his “reformed new world
order,” Mr. Blair must now match his words with action. His first test, which
is largely symbolic and simple, requires no troop deployment or emergency
funding. It was tactfully recommended in the report of the Joint Parliamentary
Middle East Councils Commission of Enquiry, after its visit to the Palestinian
refugee camps in Palestine, Jordan, Syria and Lebanon in September 2000, that
“The British Government might consider it particularly appropriate, at this
time, to make some verbal gesture of acknowledgement of the historical
responsibility that Britain bears for the creation of the refugee crisis that
continues today.”<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;<span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Although symbolic gestures of this kind
have contributed to the resolution of conflicts in other former colonies, it
can, at best, in the Palestinian context, only be considered a step in the right
direction. The fact that the Palestinian refugees account for more than half of
the world’s refugee population is not only an indicator of the scale of their
human tragedy but equally of the enormity of political effort needed to end
their century-old nightmare. For while the depopulation of their villages in
1948 started their exodus, it must not be forgotten that the struggle to remain
on their land goes all the way back to 1886 when European Jewish colonists
forcefully attempted to prevent peasants from grazing on lands in Mulabis
Village (Peta Tikva) north-east of Yaffa.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;Should
experience become their trusted mentor, the Palestinian refugees would have very
little reason to expect a change of heart in Washington or London. Everything
that has occurred since the beginning of the conflict confirms that Western
policy was guided not by the value and rule of international law but by the
pragmatist demands of containment and balance of power in the region. Nothing
illustrates this clearer than the policy of disengagement pursued by the United
States in the one year that preceded 11 September 2001, a period in which the
Israeli military occupation killed 696 Palestinians (174 of whom are children
below the age of 18), injured 28,916 (2,832 of whom suffer from permanent
disabilities), assassinated 65 Palestinian political activists and figures, and
destroyed 5,003 Palestinian homes. Field studies conducted by local research
institutions affirm that 60% of those killed were refugees, who constitute just
over 50% of the population in the occupied territories. After taking into
account the proportion of population size, the number of Palestinians killed in
the West Bank and Gaza in the twelve months leading up to 28 September 2001 is
equivalent to nine times the number killed in the attack on the United States.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>So why has the United States and its allies refused to condemn this as
terrorism? <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;Charles
W. Yost, the former U.S. Undersecretary of State, explained the reason insofar
as it applies to America. “We all righteously condemn it–except when we
ourselves or friends of ours are engaging in it. Then we ignore it or gloss it
over or attach to it tags like “liberation” or “defence of the free
world” or “national honour” to make it seem something other than what it
is.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the absence of any
similar admission from a serving or former high-ranking British official and
given the <i>special relationship</i> between the White House and Whitehall, one
may also explain Britain’s position in the same manner.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;Another
glaring illustration of this two-facedness is witnessed in the case of Slobodan
Milosovic. After his indictment by The Hague Tribunal for war crimes, the U.S.
and European Union withheld all forms of aid to the Federal Republic of
Yugoslavia until he was handed over for trial. Now that a similar case is played
out in Belgium against the Israeli Prime Minister, Ariel Sharon, the world is
watching in anticipation at the attitude of Washington and its European allies.
On Friday, 28 September 2001, Belgium’s Public Prosecutor <span style="color:black">ruled
that the complaint against Ariel Sharon for crimes against humanity and war
crimes is grounded and rejected </span>the Israeli defense argument that Sharon
has immunity as head of government. In the light of the gravity of his crime,
the EU and the U.S. must also consider withholding military and financial aid to
the Jewish State until justice is seen to be done.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto"><span style="font-weight:normal">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-weight:normal">Of
course, the need for impartiality and balance does not end with the trial of
Ariel Sharon. As the war on terrorism intensifies and bank assets are seized or
frozen across the world, it must be recalled that America’s strategic ally,
Israel, featured high among 15 countries “black-listed” by the OECD in June
2000 for being a cash haven for international criminals. The report affirmed
that billons of dollars accrued from drugs, prostitution, bribes and various
forms of criminal activity are laundered in Israel each year. It moreover
accused the Tel Aviv establishment of refusing to tighten rules or to cooperate
in international efforts to investigate suspicious funds. In the event, it is
only fair that the Jewish State should be brought to book.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span><o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto"><u>&nbsp;</u><b><u><span style="font-style:normal">Security,
justice and the law</span></u></b><span style="font-size: 12.0pt"><br>
Amid all the changes expected in the aftermath of 11 September 2001, one reality
would remain constant; it is the unbreakable bond between the rule of law,
justice and security, which only comes about when there is respect for the law
and the rights of all are guaranteed and protected by it. However, when this
principle is violated and replaced by racist notions of superiority and
privilege, insecurity and mayhem becomes the order of the day. This remains the
underlying cause for the climate of permanent instability that bedevils the
Middle East.<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:left"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Had
the international community moved decisively to ratify the Rome Statute of the
International Criminal Court (ICC) after 120 states voted in support of it in
July 1998, gunboat diplomacy would not have become the principal option in the
campaign against international terrorism. The great value of the ICC is that
unlike the International Court of Justice (ICJ), which deals with States, the
ICC has the power to investigate, prosecute and convict individuals. While
Britain took the commendable step and ratified the Rome Statute on 4 October
2001, both the United States and Israel are still refusing to do so. The latter
two object to Article 8, paragraph 2(b), sub-para (viii) of the Statute, which
considers the transfer by an Occupying Power of part of its own civilian
population into the territories it occupies a war crime. On the face of it,
therefore, America’s continued opposition must be seen for what it is, the
proposition of a minuscule and truncated State for the Palestinians. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:left"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Ultimately, selling such a
limited “vision” of a Palestinian State would be difficult. For not only is
it contrary to the Rome Statute but it is also a violation of United States law
itself. In 1973 the Congress enacted a series of laws prohibiting economic or
military assistance to any country that violated the human rights of people
within its borders for political reasons. Similarly, the Foreign Assistance Act
of 1974 entrusted the president with powers to “substantially reduce or
terminate security assistance to any government which engages in a consistent
pattern of gross violations of internationally recognized human rights.” No
American president has ever since utilized these powers to effectively end
Israeli violation of Palestinian human rights in the occupied territories or in
Israel. None is ever likely to do so while upholding the sacred doctrine that
the Jewish State must have a strategic “edge” or “advantage” over its
neighbours. <o:p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:left"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">Thus, while it may seem wise to
prevent the proliferation of nuclear weapons and weapons of mass destruction in
the Middle East, it certainly is absurd to allow a single country, Israel, to
develop a nuclear capability and export this advanced technology to volatile
regions like South-East Asia. Indeed, it is politically irresponsible to exempt
this solitary country from the rigours of international inspection, monitor and
control. <o:p>
</o:p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:left"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">In retrospect, Western leaders
were no less guilty than their adversaries in using the Palestinian issue for
their own ends. After the Gulf war, they used it to convene the Madrid
Conference and to promise, as part of a new world order, a peace settlement
based on “land for peace”. Few can deny today that the entire project has
been a scandalous fiasco. The current cries of vision and reform resonate with a
familiar sound of deception. They sound empty and meaningless when it is
recalled that those who now call to this new internationalism are the same
visionaries who contemptuously refused to sit down and engage the peoples of the
developing world in Durban days before the New York attack. <o:p>

<p align="left" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;
text-align:left"><span style="font-size: 12.0pt">By affirming their newfound
zeal to resolve the Arab-Israeli conflict, Western leaders have once again
returned, albeit reluctantly, to the <i>raqam as sa’ab</i>—the difficult
number—in the equation of global peace. Their room for manoeuvre and options
are significantly more limited than they ever were. Either they relate to the
Palestine Question as another media exercise to score points and boost
popularity ratings or they eradicate the festering causes of frustration and
anger: Israel’s terrorism against the Palestinian people. <o:p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Since the 11 September terror attacks in New York and
Washington, Zionist circles have been almost uncontrollably emitting their
profound hatred of Islam in ways unseen since Hitler’s Nazi Germany.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">From Occupied Jerusalem, to London, to New York, to
California, the Zionist, or the Zionist-controlled press has been propagating
one and the same message: kill the Muslims, kill the Arabs, kill the terrorists!
The equation of Muslims with terrorists was conspicuous throughout hundreds of
editorials, commentaries, talk shows, interviews and even grossly opinionated
hard news.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">So, all of a sudden, it seemed as if Zionist and
pro-Israeli editors and anchormen, who have a long history of poisoning Western
public opinion with concocted lies and myths about the Palestinian cause,
finally seized their long-awaited opportunity to display their deep hatred for
Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As a result, hundreds of millions of Muslims around the
world, already shocked by the infernal terrorism in the U.S. and struggling to
ward off fast-spreading Islamophobia that is often accompanied by violent
racism, had also to reckon with extremely virulent and rabid Zionist efforts to
besmirch, vilify, demonize and even de-legitimize Muslims altogether.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The seemingly coordinated campaign has been unprecedented
in its maliciousness, unmatched in its nefariousness.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">This vindictive campaign, spearheaded by the Zionist
media, but by no means confined to it, carried tacit and often explicit messages
so horrifying that they can only be construed to mean or to imply condoning
genocide against Muslims.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">One message, appearing on an Israeli-America web site (<a href="http://www.israelinsider.com/">www.israelinsider.com</a>),
urged the West to aim at the religious centre of Islam, the Ka’aba.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The author, Reuven Koret, an Israeli-American Islam-hater
applying Nazi ideas to Muslims, suggested that America should bomb Mecca and
destroy the Ka’aba if American targets were attacked again by terrorists
bearing Muslim names.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Whether it is publicly announced or merely
communicated through quiet channels, the Jihadists must know with an absolute
certainty that the next outrage against a symbol of the West will prompt a
reciprocal response against a corresponding site of interest to Islam. Let us
pray the holy shrines of Islam continue to serve the peaceful worshippers of
Allah (note he slyly used the word “Allah,” instead of “God” to imply
that Allah is a different God other than the one worshipped by Judaism and
Christians.) But should the Jihadists ever again fare to consider a genocidal
assault on the people and symbols of Western civilization, let them know beyond
the shadow of a doubt that they will pay a correspondingly heavy price in the
coin of what is sacred to them.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Then the rabid Koret continued his obnoxious litany:</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“We must face Mecca now, respectfully, dealing
forthrightly with the threat that the cowards of Jihad have forced us to
confront, speaking to the murderers in the only language they understand.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Another equally rabid Jewish racist, named Zev Chafets,
also let out his venom on 14 October (<a href="http://www.nydailynews.com/">www.nydailynews.com</a>)
claiming that “the most popular figures in the Middle East are Bin Laden,
Saddam Hussein and Mullah Mohammed Omar.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">After illustrating his poisonous charade against
everything and anything Arab and Muslim, Chafet went on to suggest that the
United States army should bomb al-Jazeera Television network.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">“Dealing with al-Jazeera is a job for the military.
Shutting it down should be an immediate priority because, left alone, it has the
power to poison the air more efficiently and lethally than anthrax ever
could.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Jewish politicians, especially in the United States and
the apartheid Israeli entity, were even more rabid and vitriolic in their
fulmination.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jewish Deputy Secretary of Defense suggested that the
United States would have to think of “ending countries” and “using nuclear
weapons against terrorists and countries supporting them.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Henry Kissinger, an evil American politician believed to
be responsible for the murder of millions of innocent people from Vietnam to
Chile, told CNN on 18 September that “We must adopt unconventional methods to
fight the terrorists,” suggesting that the U.S. should target “the
ideological infrastructure of terrorism.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">He neither defined terrorism nor its ideological
infrastructure, but everyone knew what he was alluding to: Islam and Muslims.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Israel, by far the largest terrorist organization in
the history of mankind, certified war criminal Ariel Sharon declared that
“from New York to Jerusalem, the civilized world must be united against
terror.”</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The paunchy mass murderer, who in 1982 ordered the
slaughter of thousands of helpless and unprotected refugees in Sabra and
Shatilla near Beirut, uttered this hypocrisy while his murderous soldiers were
slaughtering Palestinian schoolchildren and farmers in Jenin in the West Bank.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Jewish Islamophobia, which occasionally takes the form of
brash calls for the mass extermination of Muslims, is not new, of course.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jews, as we all know, connived and colluded with the
polytheists of Quraysh for the purpose of murdering the Prophet of Islam and
eradicating “once and for all” the fledgling but growing religion.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And, as history tells us, in reaction to their treachery,
the Prophet ousted them once and for all from the Arabian Peninsula.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Jews never forgave Muslims for this, despite the fact
that throughout history, Muslims were kind to Jews and often provided them with
safe haven whenever persecuted by the Christian West.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Indeed, cursing the Prophet Muhammed is among the most
popular ways used by Jewish settlers in the West Bank to abuse Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In fact, some British Jews were so brazen in their racist
hostility against Islam that they printed the Islamic article of faith on
women’s underwear.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">A few years ago, a Jewish settler in Hebron caricatured
the Prophet of Islam as a pig writing the Qur’an. Moreover, in 1994, a Jewish
settler, a physician by profession, chose a mosque packed with worshipers to
satisfy his murderous hatred of Islam, killing 29 worshipers and maiming many
more.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The current wave of Jewish hatred for Islam and Muslims
is obviously related to the Palestinian problem. Most Jews hate, vilify, and
incite against any Muslim (or non-Muslim) nation or movement, opposing Israeli
apartheid and Nazi-like practices in the West Bank and Gaza.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The Zionists want the estimated 1.35 million Muslims
around the world not only to turn a blind eye on Israel’s rampage of murder
and terror against the helpless Palestinians, but would also like Muslims to
forget al-Masjidul Aqsa, one of the holiest Islamic shrines.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">They would like Muslims to readily accept and come to
terms with apartheid, military occupation, and perpetual oppression of the
Palestinian people for no other reason than being non-Jewish.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Extremely dirty tactics are often used to accomplish
sinister goals. In Turkey, the Zionists reportedly pressed the
military-dominated government to outlaw the teaching of the Qur’an in private
schools. (How about the Talmud, which states that non-Jews are animals in the
form of human-beings?!)</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In Indonesia, the Zionists reportedly sent two of their
American representatives to Jakarta to urge the government to exclude religious
people from the democratic process.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">And in Palestine, the Israeli government congratulated
Yasser Arafat for ordering his police to open fire on peaceful demonstrators
protesting the American bombing of Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">These are some of the overt Israeli designs against
Muslims. The covert actions are uglier and more numerous.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">But Muslims, of course, won’t cave in to this Jewish
insolence, even when the Jewish-controlled American government is mobilized to
impose an unjust “peace settlement” on the weak Palestinian leadership of
Yasser Arafat. Such a sham peace would not hold.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">For their part, Muslims should be more vigilant in the
face of the rabid Jewish, or Jewish-led blitz of hatred and vilification.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Jews must be made to understand that their vilification
of Muslims is more than a “seized public relations opportunity.” It is a
two-way street, as evil will eventually rebound on the evil-doer.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">In any case, it is the Jews who initiated this malicious
aggression of incitement against Muslims. They will have to bear full
responsibility for their ugly folly.</p>

</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Whenever Palestinians are slaughtered, we do not hear
U.S. President George W. Bush speak out in anger against the bloodthirsty
practices of Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In recent days, several Palestinians were murdered,
including Riham, a little schoolgirl only 10 years old. Riham died when Israeli
soldiers shelled a school in the al-Almaniya district in Jenin. Seven other
girls were also seriously injured in the shelling. Riham and her schoolmates
were not soldiers. They had no weapons. They were children attending school.
Every child has the right to attend school and to not be a target of war.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Later on the same day, three Palestinian men from Fateh
were killed while on their way to give condolences to a friend. The car they
were riding in exploded. They were the targets of Israeli assassins.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Sharon, the master terrorist, does not value the lives of
Palestinian infants, children, or the civilian inhabitants of the remnants of
Palestine. Intifada al-Aqsa has provided Sharon with an excuse to lay siege to
every Palestinian town, village and farmland, as well as the indigenous
inhabitants of the land.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">For more than a year, Israeli gunboats, F-16 fighter jets,
Apache helicopters, tanks, armoured jeeps and bulldozers have been launching an
all-out war against a basically unarmed people. More than 700 Palestinians have
died and another 20,000 have been injured. Many of these injured are children
and many of these children will have to live the rest of their lives bearing
permanent scars and impairments as a result of Sharon’s war against them.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Homes have been bulldozed, farmland destroyed, olive and
fruit trees uprooted, water supplies shut off or poisoned, electricity cut off,
businesses have been sabotaged, schools shelled, schoolchildren critically hurt
or killed, civilian areas bombed, and youths abducted, tortured and
incarcerated. There is no justification whatsoever for these noble, brave people
to be so cruelly and barbarically treated. No one outside of Palestine stands up
to the world and denounces the savage practices of a mad butcher who is intent
on carrying out the genocide of the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The world is ever silent to the atrocities committed
against the Palestinian people who are forced to live in the ghettos and
concentration camps into which the Israelis have cornered them. Every Israeli
endeavour every day concentrates on how to humiliate, murder, maim and torture
the Palestinian people simply because they are Palestinians living on their own
land and because the Israelis want to take away what is left of Palestine. For
52 years, the Palestinian people have been the victims of Israeli aggression,
occupation and lies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Palestinians do not have warplanes, gunboats, tanks or
helicopters that they use to attack their aggressors with. They are not given
more than $5 billion dollars by the American government like the Israelis, nor
are they armed with the latest and most sophisticated of American weapons. The
only weapon most Palestinians have against the tyranny they are under is a stone
thrown in the name of freedom.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Palestinian people are surrounded by enemies who want
to either drive them out of Palestine or to wipe them off the face of the earth.
When in bitter frustration and despair Palestinians shot Israeli Cabinet
Minister Rahavam Ze’evi in retaliation for the extra-judicial murder of Fateh
Secretary-General Abu Ali Mustafa, the killing was immediately condemned by
America. But when Abu Ali Mustafa was murdered, no voice spoke out against the
injustice and cruelty that is constantly practiced against the Palestinian
people. And what about the life of little Riham? What sin was she guilty of? Why
did she have to die?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It is impossible for a people to be so abused, so tortured,
so horribly mistreated and then expect them not to react. However, this is just
exactly what Sharon wants. He wants to push the Palestinians into a corner,
force them to fight back so he will have an excuse to kill more infants, more
schoolchildren, more innocent civilians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">“We will carry out a war to the bitter end against the
terrorists, those who help them and those who dispatch them,” Sharon declared
as he accused the Palestinian Authority of harbouring “murderers.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But the Master Terrorist is Sharon. He should wage a war
against himself. He is the worst enemy of Israel and he already has the blood of
20,000 Lebanese and Palestinians on his hands after he commanded the Israeli
invasion of Lebanon in 1982.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">But he should beware, for as long as he threatens the lives
of Palestinian officials and as long as he insists on killing more and more
Palestinians, he just might one day be cut down himself.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">As long as Imperialists and Zionists support the
terrorist policies of the war-State of Israel, there will never be peace.
Palestinians are entitled to a State of their own and they have the right to
life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. It is time this ethnic cleansing
stopped. It is time the world deals with terrorism where it really exists.</p>

it, so really, so deeply and, yes, so rightly.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the tormentor of my people. It is to me, as a Palestinian, what Nazi Germany
was to the Jews.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>America is the
all-powerful devil that spreads oppression and death in my neighbourhood.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>How can I not hate this “great Satan,” the evil empire? Does anyone
expect people to love their tormentors?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
has been, and continues to be, the sponsor, enabler, protector, and justifier of
my people’s misery for the last 50 years.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the author of 53 years of suffering, death, bereavement, occupation,
oppression, homelessness and victimization.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the usurper of my people’s right to human rights, democracy, civil
liberties, development and a dignified life.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the abettor and financier of Israeli occupation, apartheid, repression,
terror, and territorial aggrandizement…all at my people’s expense.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the protector, maintainer, sustainer and guarantor of despotism,
dictatorship, dynastic fiefdoms, and brutal autocracies, theocracies,
oligarchies and monarchies.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the evil power that denies my people their “freedoms and democracy.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
is the tyrant, a global dictatorship that robs hundreds of millions of Arabs and
Muslims of their right to freely elect their governments and rulers because
corporate America dreads the outcome of democracy in the Muslim world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">America
treats me and my people as “children of a lesser God.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
fact, in the final analysis, America offers me one of two choices: Either I
submissively accept perpetual enslavement and oppression…or become an Osama
bin Laden. Honestly, there is not a third choice; if there is one, let us see
it.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">I’m
not exaggerating at all, as I know that the distance between being tormented by
America’s oppressive hegemony and being converted or mesmerized into bin-Ladenism
is shorter and smaller than many would think, including the so-called experts in
Washington.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
fact, I dare say that the first inevitably leads to the second in a
straightforward cause-effect relationship.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">So,
please America, don’t make me an Osama bin Laden. I don’t’ want to be one;
I hate to kill innocent people, for, in our religion, killing an innocent human
being consigns the killer straight to hell. And I don’t want to go to hell.
But I don’t want to stay in America’s hell, either.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
short, it is virtually impossible for me, as indeed is the case for most
Palestinians, Arabs, or Muslims, not to hate America so much.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">For
me, in order not to hate America, I would have to be an imbecile, bereft of
dignity, or without senses and feelings…completely numb.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Only
infra-humans and quasi-beasts wouldn’t hate their evil tormentors and
grave-diggers. And America is the Palestinian people’s ultimate tormentor and
grave-digger, as well as the oppressor and killer of millions around the world.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
fact, finding an Arab these days that doesn’t hate America would be like
searching for a Jew who is infatuated with Hitler’s Germany.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are there Jews who adore the Nazis? Are there still Arabs and Muslims who
identify with the indirect, but no less-real, perpetrator of the massacres of
Qana, Sabra and Shatilla, and now Beit Rima. Maybe there still are some, but
I’m sure they soon will disappear. I know that a wealthy Saudi Emir recently
made some sycophantic remarks about being “an ally of America.” However, it
is extremely unlikely that he didn’t mean what he said. It would be scandalous
if he did, indeed.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">I
know that “hate” is evil, at least a passive evil. And I, personally, really
strive not to allow my deep hate for the American government and its murderous
policies to be transformed from the static form to the dynamic form.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">However,
others, who may even hate America more than I do, will not be able to exercise
as much self-control, as much suppression of their grievances, and as much
“wisdom.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>But static hate is
ultimately a frozen rage, awaiting the moment of explosion.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">I
know hate can be blind and deadly. But, I also know that “oppression,” as
the Holy Qura’n clearly states, “is worse than murder” (“wal-fitnatu
Ashaddu minal-qatl”).</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Hence,
I try, even strive, to make my hate for America, as rational as possible, as
constructive as possible, even as human as possible. This is not because America
deserves to be treated humanely.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">The
exterminators of 1.5 million Iraqi children, for the purpose of punishing one
man, would never deserve to be treated well, or respected. They are despicable
mass murderers of Hitler’s ilk.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">I
try to control my hate, because my goal is to live in love and peace, not to
hate and be hated by others. My goal is to be free; free from Israel’s
U.S.-sponsored and U.S.-funded oppression and occupation. I want to be free from
apartheid; what is wrong or objectionable about wanting to be free from
apartheid? I want to be free from suffering that transcends reality. I want to
be free from a life of roadblocks, checkpoints, detention camps, closed-military
zones, “targeted killing,” land-confiscation, home-demolition, and, yes,
daily massacres.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">I
also want to be free from hate, even hate for America. But I know too well that
I can’t be free from the effect until I am free from the cause, and the cause
is America’s greed, rapacity and hegemony.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">All
we want is to be left alone and allowed to live a normal life and exercise our
God-given rights and freedoms…like other human beings. Is this asking for too
much?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Please,

<p class="MsoNormal">Whenever a significant event takes place, many wonder: how
will this event affect the Palestinian Intifada?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Arab leaders met at Cairo’s Arab League Summit
recently, analysts showered us with endless rhetoric that the Summit’s
decisions might contribute to the halt of the Intifada, even if they failed to
provide meaningful support for the Palestinians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The recent Summit and all other summits failed to impose
any real pressure on Israel or those who supply Israel with weapons, but the
Intifada rages on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">When Palestinian Authority officials meet Israeli
intelligence officers to discuss “security cooperation”, “truce” or
“ceasefire”, we are told, “Okay, everyone, time to go home, the Intifada
is over.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet despite everything, the Intifada carries on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And now with the 11 September attacks on the United States,
many were sure that the United States would be keenly interested in ending the
Middle East strife, so as to strengthen its coalition for the “war on
terrorism.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Those who are convinced of such analysis cite President
George Bush’s recent statement in support of Palestinian Statehood, while
others talk about information “leaks” that the United States is pressuring
the PA and Israel to bring an end to the “violence” and to resume talks.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada, however, will carry on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">What most people fail to see is that the Intifada is not a
ploy, nor is it a political tactic aimed at pressuring Israel for “more
concessions.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada is not a puppet show run by the Palestinian
leadership to garner international support using the world’s media.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada was and shall always be a genuine act led and
developed by the oppressed masses who are in fact revolting against oppression,
political ploys and empty promises.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Palestinian uprising develops, grows and changes its
methods. It responds to Israeli violence with counter-violence, and this is the
legitimate right of every man, woman and people to defend themselves.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The increasing use of firearms by Palestinians was not an
indication of a “radical faction’s” control over the Intifada as some
claim, but a natural response to the Israeli use of F-16 warplanes, directed
missiles and tank shells.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Suicide bombings are not a manipulative tactic either;
killing oneself can never be a tactic. Palestinians do treasure life, but when
pushed to the limit, they explode. They are only humans—humans who have
experienced untold pain for over five decades—left alone to fight an unequal
battle.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Slingshots cannot stand against the might of the world’s
fourth strongest army for too long. The idea might spark a poem or a song, but,
in reality, not enough to provide meaningful protection for a nation that is
left to endure the pain of betrayal and the savagery of an apartheid State and
army.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Unlike what Israel alleges, Yasser Arafat is not in control
of the uprising, nor even Hamas, Islamic Jihad or any other group. What truly
controls the Intifada are the unwritten principals of justice and freedom that
most Palestinians—in the West Bank, Gaza Strip and elsewhere—have agreed to
uphold.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada shall always head in the right direction as
long as it steadfastly holds to these principals.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">One must admit that many have tried to trick Palestinians
and manipulate their uprising to serve a political agenda, but despite all, the
uprising will continue.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">It’s a mistake to say that the Intifada started on 28
September 2000, for the Palestinian people are in reality living an ongoing
Intifada.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In reality, the Palestinian uprising of 1936 never truly
ceased; it developed, it changed, and the torch was handed from one generation
to another. But it never ended.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada will end when Palestinians lose track of their
priorities and become apathetic to their freedom and legitimate rights. You know
as much as I do that this would never happen.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">So let President Bush try all of his political manoeuvres
to strengthen his coalition; let him envision a “Palestinian State”; and let
Shimon Peres meet with top Palestinian officials and sip coffee and talk about
the good old days of Oslo.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Yet once Bush’s temporary vision of a State is over and
his vision of an American embassy in Jerusalem is back, and once the Israeli
army violates the agreed-upon “ceasefire” over and over again, they’ll
realize that all efforts have failed and that the Intifada will still carry on.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">You see, the Intifada was a revolution against empty
promises, a rejection of “security” meetings in which lists of Palestinian
activists are handed to the PA so that they can be arrested; imaginary
“peace” and a false process.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">The Intifada is not a political ploy. It is truly a
people’s cry for justice.</p>

</span></i></p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;The recent U.S. military strikes in Afghanistan are
ill thought out and unjustified. We are told that the U.S. military action is
part of a larger ‘war on terrorism’, a war that is supposedly being waged to
diminish the threat of international terrorism. Yet the strategic objectives are
less than clear; the declared primary objective is to disrupt and fetter al-Qaeda’s
terrorist operations and thus to diminish the threat posed by that organization,
whilst the secondary objective is to bring about the demise of the Taliban
regime in Afghanistan.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Paradoxically, rather than diminish the threat of
international terrorism, the U.S. military action in Afghanistan is likely to
exacerbate it. From the outset, U.S. President George W. Bush has stressed that
this is not a ‘war on Islam’ but rather a war against terrorists and those
that harbour them. The Bush administration and the British Government have been
at pains to get across their message on this point, despite the reference to a
‘Crusade’. In fact ‘Mullah’ Tony Blair has been on a whistle-stop tour
of the Middle East, reverently interpreting the Qur’an and Islam for the
faithful.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Prior to the U.S. bombing raids on Afghanistan, Bush had
been able, in the wake of the terrorist attacks of 11 September, to bring on
board the majority of Islamic States in his coalition on terrorism. However, the
sympathy of Muslims for the terrorist attacks of 11 September will now, no
doubt, be eclipsed by the sense of outrage at the U.S. military action in
Afghanistan—military action that ultimately will lead to more civilian loss of
life than the terrorist attacks of 11 September. Thus, any Islamic State that
supports the U.S. military action will undoubtedly face internal turmoil.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Further, it should be borne in mind, that al Qaeda is an
international terrorist network; it can recruit and operate throughout the
world. Therefore it is not dependent upon either Afghanistan or the Taliban; it
is dependent upon enraged Muslims flocking to Bin Laden’s call for Jihad. In
the eyes of many Muslims, the U.S. bombing campaign in Afghanistan is itself an
act of terrorism. Whilst condemned in the U.S. as a terrorist, Bin Laden is for
some a Muslim icon—a contemporary Salah al-din. In fact, were Bin Laden to be
killed in the current wave of air attacks, he would pose an even greater threat
to U.S. security dead than he does alive.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">The secondary strategic objective—to bring about the
demise of the Taliban—whilst achievable, is again ill thought out. The U.S.
has no defined plan to establish an alternative government in Afghanistan, and
President Bush has already declared that the U.S. has no intention of getting
involved in ‘nation-building’. In fact, Bush has offered to cease the
military action in Afghanistan if the Taliban capitulate and hand over Bin Laden
and his lieutenants. Therefore, quite clearly, there is no humanitarian purpose
in the U.S. military action. Whatever is said about the humanitarian outrages
perpetrated by the Taliban regime, the U.S. is only concerned with getting their
man: Bin Laden.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Thus it is hard to see how the U.S. bombing campaign in
Afghanistan is anything more than a show of force; a means to redress the
impotence of the U.S. <i>vis-à-vis </i>the terrorist attacks of 11 September.
The U.S. needs to reassure the American public that it can retaliate, if not
against the culprits, against their brethren. For if the U.S. were seen not to
retaliate, the American public would not only feel vulnerable to further
terrorist attacks but powerless to deter them. Hence, the U.S. needs her
‘pound of flesh’ and if thousands or millions of Afghanis die to fulfil that
need, so be it. Yet, it may not end there; the U.S. has not ruled out further
attacks against other Islamic nations.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Moreover, whilst President Bush talks of a war on
international terrorism, it is ‘Islamic terrorists’ that are the focus of
this war. It is only ‘Islamic terrorist’ suspect who are being rounded up
and arrested. In fact, all 22 of the U.S. most-wanted terrorist are ‘Islamic
terrorists’. Nor is the U.S. willing to debate what groups are to be
considered terrorists. The international world is expected to accept the U.S.
classification, which includes legitimate resistance movements to the Israeli
occupation, which are recognized as such by the United Nations. Yet, conversely,
the U.S. will not condemn Israeli State terrorism perpetrated against the
Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="MsoBodyText">Therefore it is hard to understand that this is not a war
against Islam; Muslims are being indiscriminately targeted in Afghanistan, and
it is Muslims who are the focus of the U.S. scourge on terrorism. The inequity
of U.S. foreign policy is all too clear. So perhaps the real strategic objective
of the U.S. military action in Afghanistan is to show the Muslim world that
retribution will be disproportionate and indiscriminate.</p>

Bush claims America is launching a campaign against all terrorist groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They say it’ll be a long, hard war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, they appear to be only against so-called “terrorist” groups in
the Arab/Muslim world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Bush claims
that this is not a clash of civilizations.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>He claims America is not against Islam, but that they only want to root
out the evil terrorists.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span>How can we believe this?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>We
have many contrary signs.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>In the
beginning, Bush used the word “Crusade” and then tried to make amends for
this by visiting a local mosque.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
idea of “Crusade” is still in their cultural subconscious.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Next we find that they are bombarding an underdeveloped and already
ruined country, Afghanistan. The people have suffered drought, famine and years
of war. Yet, America subjects them mercilessly to more.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They have killed civilians. They killed four Afghani United Nations
employees. Collateral damage?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is not fair. All human life is valuable. Western thinking allows them to kill
some innocents to reach their main objectives. Islamic thinking condemns the
killing of all innocents. It should be avoided as much as possible. The loss of
one human at the hands of another is as if all humans have been killed. These
human lives are valuable despite America’s twisted view on the value of human
life.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They have been striking from
planes above without having to confront the human faces before them. Is it
really so easy for them to kill?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

</span>America keeps changing its mind. It has since the beginning. First, they
only wanted Osama bin Laden. Then they wanted him and his Al-Qaeda group. Then
they wanted to punish Taliban. Now, they want to topple Taliban, which is an
internal problem and none of their business. Are they supposed to be in the
business of going around the world and toppling all governments they don’t
like?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Their goal changed from the
beginning. They have other goals and are planning to strike other countries in
the region, but how many will suffer now directly from their bombs and
brutality? How many more innocents will die?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>They fear Muslims building a strong country that may not obey American
will.<span style="mso-spacerun:

themselves the only strong power around the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If this is not true, then why are they going after only Arab and Muslim
terrorist groups? Why are they hitting civilians in Afghanistan?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They may try to claim it was a mistake or even try to hide the facts.
Mistake? A careless mistake like when America bombed the Chinese embassy in
Serbia? Such mistakes should be avoided.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Also,
Americans and others around the world are turning this into a religious battle
because they are attacking and harassing Arabs and Muslims, as well as burning
mosques, right in their own back yards.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
racist actions will lead to the next war.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
shows the mentality of some Americans.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
fear what they don’t know and really don’t care to know.<span style="mso-spacerun:

having the real idea of why the Crusades were fought.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

</span>It is a war against Islam and Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>The American government has signed some new issues into laws.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They want to be able to freeze accounts of terrorist groups or even
sponsors of these groups. They will surely make a lot of mistakes and take the
money of many innocent business people and private citizens in this “witch
hunt.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>The government needs new
funds, so they plan to take them from suspected terrorists. How much proof will
be required? Just the fact that they are Arab and Muslims?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Are we reliving McCarthyism?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
have even gotten other countries to agree to freeze funds and give America the
assets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>America has closed down
businesses and companies as well as charity organizations they claim are
supporting terrorist groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>This
is terrible to close charity groups.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>These
kind of groups support orphans, hospitals, schools and poor families in various
Third World countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Just because
something may “look” suspicious doesn’t make it guilty.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>If they close down these charitable organizations, they will really hurt
poor people, in particular children.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
should be careful what they are doing. <o:p>

</span>Anyway, they named three groups at the top of the list— Al-Qaeda (Osama
bin Laden’s group), Abu Sayyaf (in the Philippines), and an Islamic group in
Algeria All three just happen to be Muslims.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Other groups on the list of about 28, as well as some individuals, come
from Egypt, Kashmir, Uzbekistan, Lebanon, Iraq, Yemen and another Algerian
group.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>The strange part is they did not name Palestinian groups; the
United Nations later said that the Israeli-Palestinian conflict would be left in
a bubble because it is a special case.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They
leave it to Israel’s discretion or rather to Israel’s free will to do as it
wants.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span><o:p>

world?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why isn’t America going
after other terrorist groups or seizing their assets?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why not go after groups like the Real IRA in North Ireland, ETA (the
Basque Separatist Group in Spain who are famous for setting off bombs), FARC and
other government opposition groups in Columbia, and others throughout the world.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They could even campaign against terrorist groups in their midst like
white militant groups in America.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Why
don’t they fight against more South American drug cartels, the Mafia (in
America and Italy) as well as the Russian and Chinese Mafias?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>These drug cartels and Mafia groups are responsible for crimes, money
laundering and killings on a daily basis.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>Yet,
America is too terrified to go after these kinds of criminals.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

possible threat to all their closest allies, in particular Israel.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Afghanistan is the excuse they needed to enter the area and to strike out
in all directions at every possible Islamic group—even those who are not
militant and even those who are in reality freedom fighters in their own
countries.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>America’s new

</span>They say one thing to cover themselves with Muslims in America (as well
as justifying war with other Americans) while acting in clear ways to show us
they really want to make another “Crusade”.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They say, “Either you are with us or against us.”<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Why can’t one be neutral?<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>They’re
lining up not only those against terrorism but those against Muslims and Islam.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>They are pressuring the Muslim governments to join them and giving them
“carrots” like Pakistan’s debt relief and lifting of sanctions.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Yet, the people tell us the true message.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>In these regions, either the governments are pressured by America and
fear for their people or they are pro-Western puppets.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;

inability to rectify the severe atrocities committed against us, in Palestine,
by international Zionism drives us to seek help from outside sources to
compensate for such failure. Ironically, though, we are seeking such support
from a lame duck called the U.S.—a country that cannot, under any
circumstances, but to cater to Zionist demands. A school of thought made up of
many of our intellectuals and political analysts tend to believe that Israel is
nothing more than an American imperialist outpost, planted in our midst to serve
Western colonial designs in our region. With Israel’s existence, it is
claimed, Western influence would be secured by keeping the Arab countries
divided and under the influence of the U.S., instead of an opposing power like
Russia, while securing the continuous flow of oil to the greedy imperialists.
Contrary to such adverse theory, Arab leaderships, while divided in many areas,
tend to be undivided when it comes to opposing Israel, while Islam presents a
very formidable wall against Russian or Chinese ideologies. The vast areas of
the Arab world, from the Arab Gulf to the Atlantic Ocean, present a very
attractive strategic area for any power seeking international influence. Add to
that, the Arab leaders have shown more than once their fervent craving to align
themselves with the U.S., with all its unjustifiable support of the Jewish State
notwithstanding. On the other hand, the survival and maintenance of Israel has
so far proved to be a huge financial burden on the U.S., while its reputation on
the international scene has been dragged in the mud for supporting immoral and
illegal causes. American policies in the Arab and Muslim world has created so
much hatred among the oppressed masses that when new governments were
established following public revolutions, such as Iran, Libya and others, they
became the most anti-American political systems. <o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p align="left" style="text-align:left;page-break-after:auto">&nbsp;<span style="font-weight:normal">Why,
then, would the U.S. follow such policies that are so detrimental to its
international interests? Researching this issue while living in the U.S. for
over 35 years, I have come to the conclusion that Israel is <i>NOT</i> an
outpost of American imperialism as much as the U.S. is an outpost for
International Zionism, serving its interests epitomized in its continuous and
blind support of the Jewish State. To ensure the impeccability of its influence
over U.S. decisions, when it comes to the Arab-Israeli conflict, Zionists have
created a very well organized lobby, better known as AIPAC, to acquire influence
with the American decision makers while gaining unprecedented control over the
American media and to make sure that these U.S. officials do not waver under any
opposing pressure to change their position. In other words, by such an approach,
Zionism controls the public and their representatives so as to make sure that
all decisions regarding Israel would only cater to the Jewish State, even if
such policy deliberations contravene American national interests.<o:p>

<p class="MsoListContinue" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">It is well
known to the American Public that many lobbying groups exist in Washington who
are quite active in promoting certain interests that pertain to domestic and
foreign policy decision-making. Their activities in influencing decision makers
are not illegal as long as such influence does not compromise American national
interests and moral standards embodied in the U.S. Constitution. However, in the
final analysis, it is the House and Senate members who have the duty to examine
the lobbyists’ requests regarding certain policies and decide if such requests
contravene or foster American interests and moral standards. Of those groups,
AIPAC, which stands for American ISRAEL Public Affairs Committee, stands to be
the most important and most powerful lobbying group in Washington, DC! AIPAC is
a Zionist organization, which for all practical reasons could be considered an
extension of the Israeli government, lobbying all the time to cater to all
Israeli demands from the U.S.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp; </span>It
has succeeded tremendously in acquiring so much influence on Capitol Hill that
it would not be an exaggeration to point out that, for all practical reasons, it
controls the U.S. foreign policy <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Middle East. Ex-President
Jimmy Carter lamented that it would be political suicide to oppose it! Pat
Buchanan, a columnist and an ex-presidential nominee, once stated, &quot;Our
U.S. Congress is an Israeli occupied territory.&quot; Ex-senators Paul McClusky
of California, Charles Percy and Paul Findley of Illinois, James Aburezk of
Dakota, William Fulbright of Idaho and a few others reiterated candidly similar
views. Senator Adlai Stevenson of Illinois once stated that the Israeli Prime
Minister has more influence on our foreign policy than on his own government!
George Ball, who was the deputy Secretary of State during the Kennedy
Administration and finally the permanent U.S. ambassador at the United Nations,
has warned against the Israeli lobby; AIPAC.<span style="mso-spacerun:
yes">&nbsp; </span>In his book entitled, “Passionate Attachment (to
Israel)”, Mr. Ball confirms time after time that the Israeli lobby AIPAC is so
deeply entrenched in the Congress that nobody can risk his neck to oppose it!
The majorities of both Houses, though, agree among themselves on the above
premise, but would not dare to speak.</p>

</p>
<p class="MsoListContinue" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
36.0pt">Through the years, AIPAC has extended its influence—and this is not an
exaggeration—to effectively gain control of virtually all of Capitol Hill’s
action on Middle East Policy. Almost without exception, House and Senate members
execute its recommendations without any mitigation, because most of them
consider AIPAC to be the direct Capitol Hill authority of a political force that
can make or break their chances at election time. AIPAC means power, and its
arrogance is exposed when it does not try to hide it. In its promotional
literature, it cites the <i>New York Times</i> tribute to such power: “The
most powerful, best-run and effective foreign policy interest group in
Washington.” A former Congressman, Paul McClosky puts it more directly:
Congress is terrorized by AIPAC. Other senators and congressmen have not been so
candid about it, but many members privately agree. Its presence in Washington
represents the visible head of the organization while the rest of it functions
on the national level. AIPAC is dependent on more than 200 organized affiliated
groups with over 60,000 active committed members spread conveniently across the
50 States and who would immediately act upon receiving any instructions from the
head group in Washington under a coded AIPAC system called “Action Alert!”
With just a few contacts by AIPAC from Washington to their sister organizations
on the national level is enough to trigger a chain reaction, and in a very short
time, thousands of telegrams and telephone calls are communicated to the desired
destination, such as the offices of the representatives in Washington or to the
local chapters, all with similar messages.</p>
<p class="MsoListContinue" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt">&nbsp;<o:p>
</o:p>
</p>
<p class="MsoListContinue" style="margin:0cm;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:
36.0pt">Any member of either House whose vote does not conform to AIPAC
guidelines would be targeted to receive all kinds of contacts, ranging from
telegrams, letters and telephone calls, in order to pressure him to get back on
track. Even though AIPAC claims to be an independent organization, it would not
take issue with policies adopted by the Israelis, since its functions are simply
to convince the U.S decision makers to adopt such policies. Whether such
policies serve American interests becomes the least of their concerns. For
instance, there was a time when Thomas A. Dine, the executive director of AIPAC,
spoke warmly of President Reagan’s Middle East peace plan in 1982, only to
reverse his position when the Israeli Government rejected the plan, and likewise
so did President Reagan. “At the State Department, we used to predict that if
Israel’s Prime Minister should announce that the world is flat, within 24
hours Congress would pass a resolution congratulating him on the discovery,”
recalls Don Bergus, former ambassador to Sudan and a retired diplomat. AIPAC was
established simply to serve the interests of the Jewish State. It does not make
any difference to AIPAC if by serving Israel the U.S. interests are compromised.
The Jewish ideology of AIPAC was to implement the teachings of Israeli
leadership right from Ben-Gurion onward, as reported in the <i>Jerusalem Post</i>
on 17 August 1952. Ben-Gurion emphasized the importance of Jewish loyalty to
Israel by demanding that the collective obligation of all Zionist organizations
in all <i>nations</i> was to help the Jewish State in all circumstances and
should be unconditional, even if such an attitude is in <i>conflict</i> with the
respective nations (talking about double loyalties!). AIPAC has established its
organization on such teachings. Through the years, AIPAC has penetrated the
government system such that even the President of the United States has to feel
out their response to any decisions to be made. AIPAC executive director Thomas
Dine became so influential that at one time Lawrence Eagleburger had to
negotiate a deal with him by asking him to drop his support for legislation to
move the U.S Embassy to Jerusalem and in return the U.S. Government would
withdraw its support to supply Jordan with anti-aircraft missiles! AIPAC
director Dine rejected the offer and instead asked for new conditions such as
demanding the U.S Government to issue a letter announcing that it will not
engage in any direct contacts with the PLO. The <i>Washington Post</i> concluded
that this episode raised questions about the propriety of the Government making
deals on foreign policy issues with a private special-interest organization.
Dine retorted by stating it would be better to be strong and criticized, than
weak and ignored. He boasted later that AIPAC controls Congress, and he was
right, as the reader will be surprised to know. This should explain the strange
behaviour of the U.S. Government attitude <i>vis-&aacute;-vis</i> the PLO,
whereby the U.S., upon receiving instructions from Israel, has refused to meet
with the PLO officials to the detriment of peace in the Middle East until they
received the green light from the Zionists groups. In a similar scenario, the
U.S. at one time refused to issue a visa to Chairman Arafat to attend the UN
session based on Israel’s instructions, which contravenes the U.S. agreement
with the UN! The U.S., which lost over 50,000 Americans in Vietnam, would meet
with the Vietcong enemy in Paris to discuss peace in Vietnam, but were not
allowed to meet with Israel’s enemy for the same purpose. The U.S. attitude is
totally controlled by Israeli demands, even if such demands are in contradiction
with the American system. In 1990, the U.S., in compliance with Israeli demand,
vetoed a UN motion that called for the Security Council to send a fact-finding
mission to the area! Similarly, the U.S. vetoed a resolution asking Israel to
respect the human and civil rights of the Palestinians and the Lebanese under
occupation! We are not talking about condemning Israel for its violations of
simple human rights, but simply to respect them. Why should the U.S. veto such
resolutions except to follow obediently Israel's instructions? Should it then
surprise the American public when protesters burn American flags throughout the
Middle Eastern countries bordering Israel?</p>

White House sends prominent representatives as in 1983, when George Bush
attended together with 43 Congressmen and 16 Senators. Jack Kemp of New York
boasted, describing himself as a de facto member of AIPAC. Art Chotin from AIPAC
boasted in the seminar how over 300 candidates for congressional elections came
to visit AIPAC to explain their positions on the Arab-Israeli conflict! In
essence, they came to pay homage to the king of Capitol Hill. As described by <i>The
Christian Science Monitor</i> on 16 September 1987, AIPAC is the only lobby in
the U.S. that takes orders from a foreign power, Israel. It is powerful because
it contributes to the campaigns of members of Congress who support Israel. These
members will vote for all issues that benefit Israel even if it compromises
national interests. It was such an AIPAC attitude that prompted Mr. Adlai
Stevenson to expose such influence in the 75-76 issues of <i>Foreign Affairs </i>when
he stated that the Prime Minister of Israel has a lot more influence in the U.S.
over the U.S. Middle East foreign policy than over the policies in his own
country. Mr. Stevenson further stated that no decision concerning Israel, even
on the executive level, could be discussed without being known immediately by
the Israeli government.<span style="mso-spacerun:

forced to resign after a contributor, Harry Katz, taped him boasting that AIPAC
was “negotiating” with the incoming administration of President-elect Bill
Clinton over who would be the next U.S secretary of State! His successor at
AIPAC was Steve Gossman, who served as chairman until January 1993 when he was
named national chairman of the Democratic National Committee! But friends of
AIPAC no longer seem embarrassed to acknowledge that the organization has
progressed from “negotiating” to dictating. As <i>The Jewish Week </i>of New
York modestly put it in its 17 January 1993 issue, “another top Jewish
activist will be playing a new role as Clinton II shifts into high gear.”</p>

AIPAC activities against the U.S interests, such as ex-Congressman Paul Findley
of Illinois, Paul McClosky of California, ex-Senator Charles Percy, former
Senator James Aburezk of Dakota, William Fulbright of Idaho and a few others. It
is quite unfortunate that these few had to pay a high price for such courage, as
they lost their bids for re-elections. Ex-Congressman Paul Findley’s book,
“They dare to speak out,” exposes AIPAC practices in compromising American
interests and serving Israeli interests. AIPAC main activities include “Action
Alert”, enemy list or black list, where the names of those who oppose Israeli
positions in the Arab-Israeli conflict are exposed and scandalized. Jewish votes
will not go to the candidates on the list, and special financing would be
arranged through other organizations for those who profess pro-Israeli
positions. In September 1983, Congressman Clarence Long of Maryland led the
battle to get the Marines out of Lebanon by proposing to cut funding for the
operation. Asked by reporter John Hall, who knew of his ties with AIPAC, “Are
you sure your amendment won’t get you in trouble?” without hesitation the
Congressman replied, “I cleared it with AIPAC.” He was not joking. To be
fair to those who succumb to AIPAC pressure, we have to take into consideration
that Zionist propaganda has already prepared the general public to accept such
positions, as will be shown later in this analysis, and therefore many of the
representatives had to satisfy their constituencies by voting on Israeli
policies. President Reagan believes in the Biblical myths and therefore
settlements and occupations of the Palestinian lands fall within his perception
of fulfilling Biblical prophecies. Israeli is a “democracy” and a staunch
ally of the U.S., therefore, we should support Israel all the time, boast
members of both Houses! Nobody, and I mean nobody, was able to explain how this
strange “staunch ally” ever benefits U.S. interests.</p>

labyrinth would be simplified. Especially if the famous weapon of anti-Semitism
is used against anybody who dares to stand against Israeli policies. Many of the
meetings held on Capitol Hill to discuss these Israeli issues are open to the
public and one can be sure that an AIPAC representative would be present.
Congressman Paul McClosky (California), after returning from a trip to the
Middle East and saw for himself the illegal building of so many settlements in
the West Bank, asked to reduce aid to Israel by $150 million, which is the
amount spent by Israel on settlements. He was shocked at the immediate organized
campaign against him. He thought he was acting within the declared policy of the
U.S. of considering the settlements as illegal and which posed a threat to
peace. He received thousands of telegrams from all over but more from his own
State of California condemning his position and calling him all kinds of names,
including anti-Semitic. The Zionists have used this racial slur extensively
against anybody who criticizes Israel and it has been quite effective, as it has
worked miracles for Israel. The staged reactions of thousands of telegrams and
telephone calls opposing certain policies do not represent the reaction of the
American public or the actual constituents of the representative, but it is
usually the works of the organized Zionist groups across the nation and with the
direct instructions of AIPAC and, again, under Action Alert!</p>

re-election of ex-Senator Charles Percy of Illinois, J. William Fulbright of
Idaho and the tarnishing of the reputations of civil leaders like Rev. Jesse
Jackson and a few others. Ex-Senator Fulbright chaired the investigations into
the tax-exempt status for any donations to Israel and the massive funding
channelled illegally into the American Zionist Council by Israel. More than $5
million were poured into the Council for spending on public relations and
Zionist propaganda. Of course he was labelled anti-Semitic and an enemy of
Israel after he exposed the illegal act and failed to get re-elected. Fulbright
said the United States failed to pressure Israel for a negotiated settlement
because the great majority of the Senate of the U.S, somewhere around 80%, is
completely in support of Israel and anything Israel wants. This has been
demonstrated time and time again, and this has made it difficult for the U.S
Government to run its foreign policy. “Israel controls the Senate,” Senator
Fulbright explained to the public on “Face the Nation”, a TV programme.
Fulbright saw little hope that Capitol Hill will effectively challenge the
Israeli lobby, because it would be political suicide to oppose them, unless
possessed the courage of Eisenhower, who opposed them in 1956.</p>

this base, which is not a difficult job to do! The <i>Washington Post</i>
described the Israeli lobby as one similar to the tobacco or the gun-control
lobbies, except that we cannot criticize the Israeli lobby as we do with the
others! Mr. Ari Shavit, an Israeli columnist, reflected sorrowfully on the death
of over 100 civilians at Qana in the south of Lebanon at the hands of the
Israelis. &quot;We killed them because the lives of the others do not count as
much as our own, and we do not have to account for it.&quot; He rationalized

President Gerald Ford with 76 signatures demanding that the President should
reiterate the U.S. position of commitment to Israel security by a policy of
continued military supplies and diplomatic and economic support. Such a
statement would not have caused any ripples had it not been for the demand that
it should be made public. This shocked the executive branch that retaliated by
declaring a new approach of reappraisal regarding the U.S. policy in the Middle
East. This meant that aid for Israel could be curtailed, what else could
“appraisal” mean? Israel’s immediate response came from the Senate itself,
as Jerusalem activated its lobby in the U.S., which in turn signed up
three-fourths of the members of the senate in support of Israel’s position!
The letter was a demonstration of impressive clout, crafted and circulated by
AIPAC, it had been endorsed overnight by the majority of the Senate membership.
Several senators who at first said “no”, quickly changed their positions.
Senator John Culver admitted candidly, “The pressure was too great. I
caved.” So did President Ford. He backed down and never again challenged the
lobby. On 7 July 1987, as reported by the <i>Palm Beach Post</i>, the Reagan
Administration notified the Congress on 29 May 1987 of its intention to sell
Maverick missiles to its close ally Saudi Arabia. Within one hour, AIPAC started
its campaign to foil the sale to the detriment of national interests. In less
than 10 days, 260 members of the Congress co-sponsored a resolution to block the
sale. President Reagan withdrew his request! According to the same source in
Washington, President Bush tried to put some pressure on Israel to join the
Madrid Peace conference on the Middle East by declaring that the $10 billion
loan guarantee for Israel would be forthcoming as soon as Israel joined the
peace process. All hell broke loose as the pro-Israel AIPAC used “Action
Alert” to put pressure on the White House to retract his position, so much so
that President Bush appealed to the American public support against AIPAC. After
President Bush asked that Israel should be sanctioned for selling ballistic
missiles to South Africa, in violation of American laws, he retracted his
position after AIPAC used its influence under Action Alert! The sanctions were
waived on October 1991 and so American Law genuflects in front of Israel!</p>

from his days as chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff. At the time of the 1973
Arab-Israeli war, Mordechai Gur, the defense attaché at the Israeli embassy who
later became commander in chief of Israeli forces, came to Moorer demanding that
the U.S. provide Israel with aircraft equipped with a high technology
air-to-surface anti -tank missile called the Maverick. At the time, the U.S. had
only one squadron so equipped. Moorer recalls telling Gur: I can’t let you
have those aircraft. We have just one squadron. Besides, we’ve been testifying
before the Congress convincing them of how much we needed this equipment. If we
gave you our only squadron, Congress would raise hell with us. What was Gur’s
reply? He said, “You get us the airplanes; I’ll take care of the
Congress.” Moorer paused, and then added, “And he did.” <i>America’s
only squadron</i> <i>equipped with Mavericks went to Israel</i>! I have never
seen a President—I don’t care who he is—stand up to them (the Israelis).
It just boggles your mind. They always get what they want. The Israelis know
what is going on all the time. I got to the point where I wasn’t writing
anything down anymore; they would know everything before any other official. If
the American people understood what a grip those people have got on our
government, they would rise in arms. Our citizens don’t have any idea what
goes on. During the 1973 war, the Israelis asked for ammunitions for the
90-millimeter guns (which we sent earlier). The Pentagon made a search and found
none. Thomas Pianka, an officer then serving at the Pentagon with the
International Security Agency, recalls: “We made an honest effort to find the
ammunition. We checked everywhere. We checked through all the services—Army,
Navy and Marines. We couldn’t find any 90-millimeter ammunition at all.”
Pinaka says the Pentagon sent Israel the bad news: “In so many words, we said:
Sorry we don’t have any of the ammunition you need. We’ve combed all depots
and warehouses, and we simply have none.” A few days later, the Israelis came
back with a surprising message: “Yes, you do. There are 15,000 rounds in the
Marine Corps supply depot in Hawaii.” Pianka recalls, “We looked in Hawaii
and, sure enough, there they were. The Israelis had found a U.S. supply of
90-millimeter ammunition we couldn’t find ourselves.”</p>

Buchanan made about Israel’s influence over American foreign policy. However,
AIPAC did not make a big deal about it until Mr. Buchanan ran for the 1996
presidential elections. AIPAC used its connection with the media to label him
with the most powerful weapon at AIPAC’s disposal: anti-Semitic. Mr. Buchanan
was well known for being a good Catholic who on more than one occasion declared
that anti-Semitism was the greatest of all evils, yet his “mistake” was that
he criticized Israel on various political issues, in particular the illegal
settlements. He was bombarded with all kinds of criticism and was accordingly
accused of being anti-Semitic! He was shocked at such public reaction, but upon
further investigations, he found out that well-organized pro-Israel pressure
groups, AIPAC and the members of both Houses initiated the whole smear campaign
directed against him. In February and March of 1996, while he was campaigning
for elections, Zionists like New York columnist A.M. Rosenthal, Edward Koch and
William Safire kept demonizing him with slurs of anti-Semitism in the news
media, as well as TV talk and radio shows. He was against the war on Iraq,
because it did not serve American national interests, but serves Israel only,
because Iraq was the only Arab country whose military power posed a challenge to
Israel in the Middle East. As a result of the Zionist lobby, the U.S.
spearheaded a worldwide campaign to go to war against Iraq. It was because of
this that Mr. Buchanan labelled the Congress as “Israeli occupied
territory.” Two groups wanted war with Iraq: the Israeli Defense Ministry and
its counterpart in the U.S.—the members of the House, he explained! Is it
anti-Semitic, he asked, to put American national interests above the interests
of a foreign country?</p>

smithereens, Israeli Prime Minister Ariel Sharon continues waging his bloody war
against the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Our prestigious United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan,
the winner of the Nobel Peace Prize, does nothing to stop this ongoing genocide
against the Palestinian people.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">And while the U.S. Secretary of State Colin Powell demands
the immediate withdrawal of Israeli forces from Palestinian territories, Sharon
gleefully defies Powell’s demands knowing he can get away with whatever he
wishes, including murder. After all, Israel is the Frankenstein monster that
America created, protects, and condones. Every time a UN resolution is drafted
condemning Israeli atrocities, the U.S. is the first country to use its veto
power.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every day, more and more Palestinians are murdered, and
many more are wounded. The dead include mothers, fathers and children. Recently,
a deaf man was shot and killed when he went out to buy food for his five
starving children, and a mother of nine children was killed. Israeli armoured
tanks and vehicles roll into Palestinian West Bank towns to crush, burn out, and
slaughter Palestinian civilians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In Beit Reema, Israeli soldiers killed more than nine
Palestinians and left dozens to lie injured and bleeding in the streets
unattended. Military jeeps invaded the small village, and Apache helicopters
fired randomly at residential homes in the area. Houses have been bulldozed and
set on fire. Furthermore, Israeli soldiers have been conducting house-to-house
searches and have been arresting Palestinian males.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">At the time this article is being written, no Palestinian
is allowed to enter or leave the village of Beit Reema. No ambulances have been
allowed to enter the village and attend to the victims. The same situation is
recurring in other West Bank towns and villages.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Fierce gun battles have broken out in other West Bank
areas, but light arms are nothing against tanks, bulldozers and helicopter
shelling.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Every West Bank city is under siege and the lives of all
Palestinians are at risk. The situation there is very critical and mere
condemnation of Israeli atrocities does not save lives or prevent the injury of
the innocent. So far, 21 Palestinians have been murdered.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">Clearly, the Israeli soldiers have no mercy, no compassion
and no respect for the property, lives and well-being of the Palestinian people.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes">&nbsp;
</span>Sharon defies international calls for the withdrawal of his troops from
Palestinian areas and he declares, as any monster would, that he will continue
his slaughter until he is satisfied. But Sharon is a pathological killer and he
likes nothing better than to massacre Arab civilians regardless of the country
of their origin.</p>

U.S. has begun fighting on a second front in its overseas conflict. In addition
to the “war on terrorism”, President Bush has initiated a “propaganda
war” in the Middle East. But on both fronts, actions speak louder than words,
which means the U.S. is fast becoming its own worst enemy.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
the war on terrorism, the U.S. has stated that it is targeting Osama bin Laden
and his Taliban allies but not innocent civilians. Yet as the U.S. steps up its
bombing, Osama bin Laden remains at large and Taliban casualty numbers are
unclear. Meanwhile, confirmed reports of civilian casualties due to the U.S.
military campaign increase and a massive refugee crisis worsens.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
the propaganda war, the U.S. hopes to convince the region that it respects
Muslim public opinion. Here, too, U.S. actions have accomplished the opposite of
their intended goal.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">Consider
the case of al-Jazeera. The Arabic-language satellite TV channel has been
praised internationally as the most independent source for news from the region,
yet it is under continual pressure from the Bush administration for broadcasting
statements from bin Laden and reporting on civilian deaths from the U.S.
bombings. Apparently, the Bush administration has no problem with Muslims
expressing support for the war on terrorism. But when Muslims freely express
deep ambivalence or anger toward U.S. policy and the bombing campaign in
Afghanistan, they are met with suspicion, even scorn.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">In
the world of strait-jacketed Arab media, al-Jazeera has one of the only free
hands. Its talk shows can legitimately claim to showcase the full range of Arab
opinion—the good, the bad and the ugly—on global affairs. In terms of
candour and analysis, al-Jazeera’s featured debates put most of the sleepy
political talk shows in the U.S. to shame. The channel’s news reports are also
generally quite balanced. Al-Jazeera’s on-the-spot investigations of the
bombed Afghan villages handled Taliban estimates of civilian deaths with
caution. Is the U.S. for free press or not? Respecting Muslim public opinion
will mean listening to critical views.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">But
Washington continues to treat al-Jazeera as if it were the Taliban’s Ministry
of Information. Even though the channel’s critiques of U.S. policy largely
reflect what its viewers already think, the State Department lambasted
al-Jazeera for its “inflammatory rhetoric.” Secretary of State Colin Powell
went so far as to demand that the channel’s editorial chiefs “tone down”
its guest commentaries. In an attempt to counteract views in the region,
National Security Adviser Condoleezza Rice and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld
have both appeared on the channel recently.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal" style="mso-layout-grid-align:none;text-autospace:none">At
the same time, the U.S. Congress is currently working to initiate a
“Radio-Free Afghanistan” to broadcast American intentions toward the region.
But the plan has run into some problems. Even if the message arrives over the
constant ruckus of U.S. ultimatums about regional news sources, Afghan citizens
may not be able to hear the broadcasts over the noise of the falling bombs.</p>

<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I am a Muslim Palestinian. I believe in the unity of
God, which is the hallmark of Islam. There is no God but Allah (this is our
personalized Arabic name for God). This belief liberates my outlook, for I see
the whole universe belonging to the same Allah, God, that I belong to. My love
and care go unconfined to any sphere or group anywhere. This belief produces in
me the highest self-esteem for the person who believes in the greatness of Allah
(God), who never bows his or her head in homage to any of His creatures or who
stretches out his hand to anyone else in symbolic worship. Islam imparts to my
heart the consolation, the determination and the bravery to resist unjust
circumstances.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;This is the Islam I know and have comprehended from
the Qur’an and the authentic Islamic literature; I learned about equality from
Surat (chapter) Al-Hujurat:13 (verse): “O mankind, We’ve created you from a
male and a female and have made you nations and tribes that you may know and
interact with each other. The noblest of you in the sight of Allah (God) is the
best in conduct.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In the authentic Islamic literature, Prophet Mohammed
(may peace be upon him) gave us the basis for our relationship with others in
the Hadith (sayings of the Prophet), “You are not considered faithful in the
sight of Allah (God) unless you like for your brother what you like for
yourself.” These ideas are based on love and care.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Many people within the Islamic world speak in anger
toward the West and do not behave according to the dictates of our Qur’an.
Why? For the last century, the Islamic world has been suffering from repetitive
atrocities perpetrated by the West: colonization; mandated governments not fully
supportive of the rights of the indigenous people; Western-supported Arab
secular and religious dictatorships; and direct and indirect interference in the
internal affairs of the Islamic or Arab nations. The utmost of those
aforementioned atrocities is represented by the superpower’s open financial
and moral support of Zionism and the Israeli occupation in Palestine.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In reaction to such atrocities, few who follow Islam
have adapted their sentiments and beliefs to those that do not fit with the
lessons we were taught from the Qur’an or the other essential Islamic guide,
the Hadith.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Just as some Christians can find amazingly violent
justifications for perceived evils, but which we abhor today in the first five
books of the Bible, some Muslims can seek out and select teachings from the
Qur’an and Hadith that are easily taken out of context and used to advance
their own ideology. This use of our ancient, God-given literature to support
atrocities or to relate God’s will to what’s happening to us because of the
modern “isms”, such as communism, nationalism, Zionism, socialism and
capitalism, is not limited to East or West, Muslim or Christian. When the chips
are down, people look to God’s will for justification or for relief of pain.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;As an example that is relevant to our situation here
in Palestine, the father of Revisionist Zionism, Vladimir Jabotinsky, told those
he sought to influence in 1923, “Zionist colonization, even the most
restricted, must either be terminated or carried out in defiance of the will of
the native population. This colonization can continue or develop only under the
development of a force—an iron wall which the native population cannot break
through.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;It isn’t surprising that some Islamists reacted to
such a statement by throwing up a natural defense system. Perceiving people like
Jabotinsky to be the enemy of Islam and of Palestinian Arabs—Christian or
Muslim—they felt justified in fighting back.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;So, the name-calling began. Those seeking to protect
themselves in the name of God, the Almighty, began to say that, “It is America
who has become the mother of evil. America gives the Zionists military support
and finances immigration of Jews from all over the world to our land. It is
America who forced the United Nations to set aside our land, illegally, for the
State of Israel. It is America who consistently vetoed UN resolutions that
further reduced our potential for productive lives. Surely this is aggression
against the Arab and Islamic world.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Jews and Christians alike became Zionists and
Crusaders respectively in the eyes of some Islamists. Dreams about and real
accounts of the European Crusades became very real in some Muslim psyches. They
knew what jihad (Holy War) had meant to Richard the Third and his army of God,
so it didn’t take much to turn the tables and declare jihad against the West.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Just as Christian Crusaders left their Christian
values and their manners at home when they invaded the Middle East, particularly
Jerusalem, many Muslims find it easy to forget the ethics of Islam and Jihad.
After all, what we do in war is the result of human beings’ struggle for
survival, regardless of the religious or ethical rules we learn through
religious teachings.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;When any group, Muslim or Christian, declares war
against a people, they violate their respective religion’s doctrine of
personal responsibility. The Qur’an I read says it this way, in Surat
Al-Ana’am:164, “Every soul takes responsibility for his or her acts on none
but himself or herself. None of us are expected to bear the burden of
another.” This teaches us to be fair and not to lump a whole community as
being collectively guilty for the sins of one member of that community. If
someone commits a crime, it is he who has to pay for it, not anyone else from
his family or from his religious or national group.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I want to share with you our part of the story: 19
Septembers ago, in 1982, I was six years old. I came downstairs for breakfast
and found my parents holding the newspaper and weeping. Of course, I felt
concern. Why would Mom and Dad be so upset?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;“With the support and prodding of an Israeli
command, Lebanese Christian forces massacred thousands of Palestinian refugees
in Lebanon in the refugee camps of Sabra and Shatilla.” Father read this to
me, quietly and flatly, directly from the newspaper.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;I didn’t quite understand the implications of my
parents’ concerns on that sad morning. I really didn’t know what
“massacred” meant. The words Israelis, Palestinians, Christians and refugees
were not part of my vocabulary. All I knew at age six was that something really
horrible had happened and that my parents grieved about it. I have always
remembered that morning, although many more violent episodes have befallen us
closer to home since. I remember the tears; the “why” came much later.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">In September, an unspeakable horror struck the world again.
But this time it wasn’t our refugee camps. This time it was the great Twin
Towers World Trade Center and the proud American Pentagon that were targeted.
Again, terrorism claimed the lives of thousands of civilians.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;In contrast with the shock that overwhelmed the world
on 11 September, Sabra and Shatilla were tucked away and mentioned only in
hushed, although persistent, voices until the man who led the perpetration of
those evils became Prime Minister of Israel with the support, as usual, from the
United States. I ask you, has America voiced a willingness to allow Osama bin
Laden to survive so that one day he may become Prime Minister of his native
Saudi Arabia or his adopted country, Afghanistan? Do you see what we see when we
talk about duplicity and double standards? We were not powerful enough to react
at the time of Sabra and Shatilla, but we’ve held that moment in our hearts.
We cannot accept the premise that ‘might makes right’, especially in terms
of our Islamic gift of self-respect.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;We, Arabs and Muslims in the Middle East, watch in
pain and disbelief the double standards and the hypocrisy of the world. So does
it really surprise you that this region is a Petri dish of festering fanatics?</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;President George W. Bush tells us that the world must
be “With us or with the terrorists;” Bin Laden responds with the same
rationale: “With Islam or with America.” Bush speaks in a Godly manner about
the “Crusades”, “the infinite justice” and “leading the world to
victory.” Bin Laden responds, “I swear to God, America will not dream of
peace before it becomes a reality in Palestine.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Once again the warlords of the world, ours and yours,
are stirring the pot of hatred and splitting humanity into two. It will take all
of our religious leaders to finally stand up and show the world what God’s
Will really is, to act upon the idea that we must love our neighbours as we love
ourselves and become our brother’s keepers.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Pondering on this global horror, here in Palestine,
we feel the apprehension of the world’s fingers pointing at us. After all, we
lived with our cries for independence and freedom for more than 50 years. We
live in a place where wars, possession and repossession, taking and killing,
have existed for a long time. Of course, we’re terrified.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Over the last year, the world has witnessed another
flare-up of the Israeli/Palestinian violence, our chronic disease. Our
ever-oppressed people against the oppressors borne of determination to occupy
our land and take it for themselves through the methods Jabotinsky spelled out
in 1923. Never, however, in all these dark years of occupation, have we
Palestinians perceived our enemy to be Judaism or Christianity. We know that our
conflict isn’t about God; it is about modern imperialism, the arrogance of
taking another people’s land.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Israeli determination to endlessly expand occupation
leaves us in harm’s way caused by those who take and those of us who are taken
from. No matter what we do, we cannot stop the onslaught that kills us and
dehumanizes us. Our homes are demolished and our land confiscated while Zionists
brag to us that they have “22 other Arab countries to go to.” Now we live in
mass community prisons; we walk along an extension of the Via Dolorosa through
checkpoints, up and down ditches, round and about iron gates. We stare wide-eyed
as the Israeli’s justify their actions saying, “Good fences makes good
neighbours.” The lies of politics easily extend into the false view of the
lessons our religions teach.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;We Palestinians are Muslim, Christian and indigenous
Jews and other religions, too, Ba’hai or Druze, for example. We have arms and
legs and flesh and blood just like Americans and Israelis. Some of us have blond
hair or blue eyes. We’re not all darkly mysterious. We love our children and
each other and others who are not like us at all. We like planting our olive
trees and harvesting our oranges. We want life in our desert community, not
death. But as we face the aggression of occupation, what choices do we have?
Some of us are motivated by religion, others by nationalism, others by sheer
determination not to give up. One of the greatest incentives we face is the
world’s indifference to us. That brings out the most destructive motivations
of the fiercest few. So, while the resistance of occupation is a right for all,
Palestinians, Muslims or non-Muslims, we fall into a mode of “Jihad.”</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;We do not wish to take this all over the world. All
we want is the peace that Jerusalem is supposed to stand for. Just as Jesus of
Nazareth, may peace be upon him, used a whip on the merchants wrongly marketing
in his father’s house, God does not suggest that we Muslims fall prey to
aggression and not defend ourselves. The Qur’an calls for us to act peacefully
to gain justice, but to resist our oppressors. Allah, our God, tells us that we
must not take what does not belong to us.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;Let me say this as clearly as I can; Islam is not the
enemy in our human struggles; only Mankind can lower themselves to be each
other’s enemy. The Qur’an is written not specifically for those of Arab
heritage, and the Islamic teachings are very similar to the ethics and morality
spelled out for Jews and Christians in their Holy Books.</p>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;As missiles in Afghanistan often miss their mark,
unable to distinguish between terrorist and peace-loving citizen, as American
weapons are used around the world by those who defy the meaning of freedom and
democracy and yet kill children along with freedom fighters, I want to ask you
all something. If you had been able to actually see what was happening in the
First and Second World Wars as they were occurring, would you have tried to put
an end to the struggle sooner? Had that been the case, maybe the Holocaust would
not have happened and we wouldn’t be in the predicament we’re in today. Our
political wars are Godless and mindless, too. Let us work together to defend our
religions from our instincts—our human greed and political motivation—and
let our actions be our prayers.</p>

<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%"><span style="color:black">The
Jewish rabbinical authorities in some eastern pans of Europe could inflict
somewhat tougher punishments. These punishments, however, were less severe than
those that had been imposed in Spain. The heads of the Jewish community in
Prague decided in 1612 that all Jewish prostitutes had to leave the town by a
certain date or be branded after that date with a hot iron (Asaf, p. 114). The
prostitutes' main offence was that they were seen drinking non-­kosher wine
with some unnamed notables of the community. The most tolerant communities were
those in Italy who, as Asaf recorded, gave full encouragement to the
prostitutes, because they saved &quot;bachelors and fools from the worse sins-
of adultery or of cohabitation with non-Jewish women.&quot;<o:p>
</o:p>
</span></p>
<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%;
tab-stops:12.0pt 14.2pt">In his previously mentioned article, Rosen recorded
research of new Jewish historians showing that Italian Jews copied the
Renaissance custom according to which a husband or brother can kill his wife or
sister with impunity if he suspects her of adultery. To remove the resultant
blemish upon the honor of an insulted husband, Jews committed many of these
murders in the synagogue during prayer in order to obtain publicity. A Jew,
named Ovadia, from Spoleto, for instance, murdered his wife in the synagogue
and, after explaining his reasons, received no punishment. The Italian
authorities put Ovadia on trial and fined him, but the Jews did not believe he
had done anything wrong. Soon thereafter, he remarried another Jewish woman.
Brothers in other cases murdered suspected women. Referring to his research,
Rosen cited one such case in Ferrara in the mid-sixteenth century. The murderer
brother worked for a charity organization that was affiliated with the
congregation; he was able to continue in his job after the murder. Rosen
determined and reported that in such cases the rabbis usually did not react.</p>
<p class="p4" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%;
tab-stops:12.0pt 14.2pt">Jewish autonomy before the rise of the modern nation
state allowed rabbis to engage in a wide spectrum of persecution, of which
violence against women was but one category. The rabbis employed various types
of violence against Jews who committed religious or other sins. Jewish
fundamentalists, wanting to revive a situation that existed before the hated
modern influences allegedly corrupted the Jews, emphasized this violence. The
centrality of violence in the Halacha played an important role in the
development of Orthodox Judaism. Orthodox Judaism historically had a double
system of law. There was, on the one side, a more normal system of law, but
there was, on the other side, been a more arbitrary system of law employed in
emergencies. These emergency situations most often occurred when rabbis had
great communal power. The rabbis, alleging that heresy and infidelity were at
dangerously high levels, often suspended the normal system of laws, at least in
the area of guarding the beliefs of the community, and used emergency powers to
avert God's wrath. A relevant example for our study concerns the death penalty.
In the normal system of law, the halachic application of the death punishment
against a Jew was almost impossible to carry out, as opposed to its much easier
application against a non-Jew. Even inflicting less severe punishment against
Jews, such as thirty­ nine lashes, was difficult. The normal talmudic
alternative to the death penalty for Jews who killed other Jews was release of
the Jewish murderer without further punishment. The Talmud posits another
alternative. This alternative, as described by Maimonides in his commentary, <i>Laws
of the Murderer and </i>of <i>Taking Precautions, </i>chapter 4, rule 8, is that
Jewish murderers, absolved of the death punishment by a rabbinical court, could
be &quot;put into a small cell and given first only a small amount of bread and
water until their intestines narrowed and then [fed] barley so that their
bellies would burst because of the illness.&quot;</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;line-height:150%">Rabbinical
judges experienced difficulty in inflicting punishment when Jewish autonomy was
limited by secular authorities. Only those rabbinical judges who were appointed
by what was called “laying of hands,”<sup> </sup>for example, could at first
inflict flogging limited to thirty nine lashes. Rabbis later devised a new more
arbitrary way of inflicting punishment called &quot;stripes of rebellion.&quot;
The new method, which could be used by any rabbi, included harsher punishments.
The number of lashes, for example, was unlimited. The cutting of limbs and
unlimited imprisonment time were added. After the talmudic period and following
the declines of the Roman and Sassanid Empires and of the Muslim caliphates,
Jewish communities in many places became more autonomous and thus the
opportunities for rabbis to impose more severe punishments increased.</p>
<p class="p1" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%">The Jewish religious authorities perpetrated most of the
violence against Jews who were considered to be heretics or religious
dissenters. The punishments imposed had to be warranted by the Talmud, or at
least by interpretation of the Talmud. The Talmud was composed under the rule
and authority of two strong empires, the Roman and the Sassanid; both of these
empires lirnited the powers of Jewish autonomy much more than did subsequent
medieval regimes. Talmudic sages frequently complained that under the rule of
these two empires, they did not have the power to punish Jewish criminals with
death but rather only with flogging. The few cases in which talmudic sages
attempted to execute a Jewish criminal prompted strict official investigations.
One of these few cases, mentioned in the Palestinian Talmud, concerned a Jewish
prostitute in the third century who was finally executed. Apparently because
execution was so difficult to enforce, the Talmud does not order a death
punishment for Jewish heretics but does enjoin pious Jews to kill them by
employing subterfuges. The major halachic codes, although emphasizing that the
death punishment should be inflicted only if execution was possible, contain
such prescription. The paradigmatic expression of this command in the codes
comes ironically under the section devoted to saving life. The question is
posed: What is a pious Jew to do when he sees a human being drowning in the sea
or having fallen into a well? The talmudic answer, still accepted by traditional
Judaism, is that the answer is dependent upon the category to which the human
being belongs. If the person is either a pious Jew or one guilty of no more than</p>
<p class="p2" align="left" style="text-align:left;line-height:150%;tab-stops:36.0pt">ordinary
offences, he should be saved. If the person is a non-Jew or a Jew who is a
&quot;shepherd of sheep and goats,&quot; a category that lapsed after talmudic
times, he should neither be saved nor pushed into the sea or well. If, however,
the person is a Jewish heretic, he should either be pushed down into the well or
into the sea or; if the person is already in the well or sea, he should not be
rescued. This legal stipulation, although mutilated by censorship in certain
editions of the Talmud and even more in most translations, appears in <i>Tractate
Avoda Zara </i>(pp. 26a-b). Maimonides also explained this stipulation in three
places: In the <i>Laws of Murderer and Preservation of Life, </i>Maimonides
contrasted the fate of non-Jews with that of Jewish heretics. In the passages
from <i>Laws of Idolatry </i>Maimonides only discussed Jewish heretics. In <i>Laws
of Murderer and Preservation of Life </i>(chapter 4, rules 10-11), he wrote:</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%;tab-stops:11.0pt">The [Jewish] heretics are those [Jews] who
commit sins on purpose; even one who eats meat not ritually slaughtered or who
dresses in a sha'atnez clothes (made of linen and wool woven together) on
purpose is called a heretic [as are] those [Jews] who deny the Torah and
prophecy. They should be killed. If he [a Jew] has the power to kill them by the
sword, he should do so. But if he has not [the power to do so], he should behave
so deceitfully to them that death would ensue. How? If he [a Jew] sees one of
them who has fallen into a well and there is a ladder into the well, he [should]
take it away and say: &quot;I need it [the ladder] to take my son down from the
roof,&quot; or [he should say] similar things. Deaths of non-Jews with whom we
are not at war and Jewish shepherds of sheep and goats and similar people should
not be caused, although it is forbidden to save them if they are at the point of
death. If, for example, one of them is seen falling into the sea, he should not
be rescued. As it is written:</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:11.0pt;text-align:left;line-height:
150%;tab-stops:11.0pt">&quot;Neither shall you stand against the blood of your
fellow&quot; (Leviticus 19:16) but he [the non-Jew] is not your fellow.</p>
<p class="p2" align="left" style="text-align:left;line-height:150%;tab-stops:36.0pt">In
<i>Laws of Idolatry, </i>chapter 2, rule 5 Maimonides stated:</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%;tab-stops:11.0pt">Jews who worship idolatrously are considered
as non-Jews, in contrast to Jews who have committed [another] sin punishable by
stoning; if he [a Jew] converted to idolatry he is considered to be a denier of
the entire Torah. [Jewish] heretics are also not considered to be Jews in any
respect. Their repentance should never be accepted. As it is written: &quot;None
that go into her return again, neither [do] they hold the paths of life&quot; <i>(Proverbs
</i>2:19). [This verse is actually a reference to men who frequent &quot;a
strange woman,&quot; that is, a prostitute.] In regard to the heretics who
follow their own thoughts and speak foolishly, it is forbidden to talk with or
to answer them, as we have said above [in the first section of the work] so that
they may ultimately contravene maliciously and proudly the most important pans
of the Jewish religion and say there is no sin [in doing this]. As it is
written: &quot;Remove your way far from her and come not near the door of her
house.&quot; (Proverbs 5:8).</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%">The last verse refers again to men who &quot;frequent a
strange woman&quot;, that is, a prostitute. The commentators explained that this
passage meant that a truly repentant idolatrous Jew is accepted by the Jewish
community, but a heretic is not accepted. A heretic who wants to repent,
however, may do it alone. The main reason for this difference is seemingly that
an idolatrous Jew, including one who converts to Christianity, accepts another
religious discipline, while a heretic follows his own views and is thereby
considered to be more dangerous. In chapter 10, rule I of <i>Laws of Idolatry, </i>Maimonides,
after explaining the extermination of the ancient Canaanites and again asserting
that no Jews should be killed, said: &quot;All this applies to the seven
[Canaanite] nations, but Jewish informers and heretics should be exterminated by
one’s own hand and put into bell, because they cause trouble to Jews by
removing their hearts from being true to the Lord, like Tzadok, and Beitos [the
alleged founders of the Sadducean sect] and their pupils. Let the name of the
wicked perish.&quot; In his next rule Maimonides asserted that non-Jews should
not be healed by Jews except when danger of non-Jewish enmity exists. In his <i>Fundamental
Laws of Torah, </i>the first treatise of his codex, chapter 6, rule 8,
Maimonides, after explaining that Jews are forbidden to burn or otherwise to
destroy the holy script and that they may not even damage any Hebrew writing in
which one of the seven sacred names of God is written, ruled:</p>
<p class="p2" align="left" style="margin-left:11.0pt;text-align:left;line-height:
150%">If a Torah scroll was written by a Jewish heretic, it should be burned,
together with all its sacred names [of God], because the heretic does not
believe in the holiness of God and could not write it for God but must have
thought that it is like other books. Therefore, given this view, God is not
sanctified [by it] and it is a commandment to burn it [the scroll] so that no
memory is left of the heretics or to their deeds. But, a Torah scroll written by
a non-Jew should be put away with the other holy books that deteriorated or were
written by non-Jews.</p>
<p class="p3" align="left" style="margin-left:0cm;text-align:left;text-indent:0cm;
line-height:150%">Although he did not instruct Jews to burn heretical books,
Maimonides probably based the above passage upon many directives issued by
talmudic sages since about AD 100. These directives called for the burning of
books by heretics. Indeed, talmudic sages even boasted at times about burning
such books themselves. Halachic codes did not so instruct, but rabbinical
response frequently called for<i> </i>and Jewish history is replete with
examples of Jews burning Jewish books. Together with burial of books in
cemeteries, this reached a high point in the eighteenth century. Although
minimized in many apologetic histories of Jews, especially in works written in
English, the burning and the burial in cemeteries of books in the history of
Judaism was far more intense than in the histories of either Christianity or
Islam.</p>
