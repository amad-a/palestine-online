    <p ALIGN="LEFT">BEIRUT- Proudly greeting fans in liberated south Lebanon and foreign
    envoys coming to congratulate him, Sayed Hassan Nasrallah is the Arab world's newest hero,
    the man behind the guerrilla ''victory'' over the mighty Israeli Army.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">When he visited the liberation zone for the first time yesterday, tens of
    thousands of people came to hear him speak.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In a black turban signifying descendancy from the Prophet Muhammad, the
    stocky secretary general of Hezbollah takes credit for his ''resistance'' movement's role
    in driving the Israelis out of Lebanon. Typically, he leaves the world guessing about the
    guerrillas' plans for the last active war in the Mideast.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">''We do not have any intention of attacking civilians, but not all
    Israelis are civilians,'' Nasrallah told foreign journalists shortly after the occupation
    ended.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A strike planned by Palestinian teachers was canceled after the events of
    Nakba Day, but the struggle is far from over. They want higher wages and a freely elected
    union, but the Palestinian Authority wants them to forget all that in the name of
    'national unity'</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Where the persuasive efforts of the Palestinian political organizations,
    the pleas of the heads of the Palestinian education system, the (unaccepted) resignation
    of the director-general of the Education Ministry, the threats, arrests and venomous
    rumors failed, Nakba Day succeeded. On the day that marks &quot;the catastrophe,&quot;
    [the Palestinians' term for their experiences following the War of Independence], bloody
    confrontations between Palestinian demonstrators and the Israel Defense Forces left three
    killed by IDF gunfire and hundreds of young people injured. After the carnage, the Supreme
    Coordinating Committee of Palestinian teachers at state schools decided, in an urgent
    telephone conference, to stop the battle it has been waging since February. The general
    strike that the 17,935 teachers at all 1,069 government schools in the West Bank were to
    have held on May 16 was canceled, and all 412,190 students returned to the regular school
    schedule.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">JERUSALEM- Transport Minister Yitzhak Mordechai, one Israel's most
    prominent politicians, will be charged with sexual assault and harassment following
    complaints from three women, Israel's attorney general said Thursday.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">His adviser, Leor Horev, said Mordechai plans to resign on Sunday. He will
    remain in the parliament, but will waive his immunity and stand trial.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Mordechai, a former defense minister and highly decorated army officer,
    has maintained that he is innocent.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The initial charge came from a 23-year-old office worker who complained to
    police that on Feb. 25 Mordechai forced her onto a sofa and put his hand under her blouse.
    After the complaint was made public, two other women came forward.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">JERUSALEM--When then-Prime Minister Menachem Begin of Israel first sent
    troops to war in Lebanon, he assured his people that the mission would last 48 hours and
    would venture no deeper than &quot;40 kilometers&quot; into the neighboring country. </p>

    since. Until this week. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">On Thursday, Prime Minister Ehud Barak quoted the Bible as he contemplated
    how his nation became mired in the mud of Lebanon for more than two decades, and whether
    it was worth it. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;When we went in,&quot; he said, &quot;there were those who said,
    'And peace will reign in the land for 40 years.' But the fact is that our presence did not
    change the reality in south Lebanon and did not prevent Katyusha rockets from being
    fired&quot; at northern Israel.</p>

    clashes in the West Bank and Gaza and intensified fighting in southern Lebanon. </p>

    coalition, he was weighing a cancellation of his scheduled departure this weekend to the
    United States to confer with President Clinton and meet with Jewish American leaders. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the violence, back-channel peace talks continued in Sweden. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli, Palestinian and American officials have characterized them as a
    serious and constructive dialogue on the process itself and on the final status issues. </p>
