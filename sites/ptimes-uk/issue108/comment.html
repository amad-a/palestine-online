<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinians! Beware of what Arafat is doing</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is ample evidence that the autocratic Palestinian leadership is
embarking on a new grand treachery, the biggest of them all, one that would have a
profound effect on the Palestinian people and their enduring cause for many years to come.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to impeccable sources, Arafat&#146;s representative Ahmed Qrei
has been discussing a draft framework agreement for the final status settlement whereby
the three most fundamental issues of the Palestinian cause are virtually scrapped.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These include the Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza, East
Jerusalem and the paramount refugees&#146; right of return, all of which have already been
dealt with through relevant United Nations resolutions, in particular 242, 338 and 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the issue of the land and the Jewish settlements, dubbed the
&#147;border issue&#148;, it is reported that Qrei, who is Israel&#146;s most favourite
Palestinian negotiator next to Arafat, has accepted (at Arafat&#146;s instructions) an
Israeli map whereby the Zionist regime would retain control over a 10-mile-wide strip of
land extending along the River Jordan. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that border crossings from and to the West Bank, home of the
contemplated Palestinian mini-State, would be firmly under Israel&#146;s control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, Israel would still retain control over large mountainous
areas throughout the West Bank, including the bulk of the settlements as well as strips of
land truncating three Palestinian cantons, one in the north, a second around Ramallah and
a third in the south including Hebron and Bethlehem regions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reported PA acceptance of this map, rejected earlier by PA negotiator
Yasser Abed Rabbo, who resigned from the negotiating team in protest at the opening of a
secret channel in Stockholm, would be a serious departure from the erstwhile declared
position of the PA that insisted on full Israeli evacuation from all territories seized in
1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As regards East Jerusalem, which Arafat has been saying will be his
capital, it has been reported that the PA leadership effectively consented to what was
termed the Belen-Abu Mazen plan, whereby Israel would continue to have overall sovereignty
over all of Jerusalem, with the Palestinian population accorded &#147;internal
autonomy&#148; in some East Jerusalem neighbourhoods, along with a guaranteed &#147;safe
passage&#148; to the Haram al-Sharif (Muslims&#146; third holiest site).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, leaks from the Stockholm talks suggested that the refugee issue
was nearly &#147;finalized&#148; in line with the declared Israeli position which rejects
the implementation of UN resolution 194, which grants the refugees repatriation and
restitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, PA security official Muhammed Dahlan actually admitted that
the PA leadership &#147;was realizing that the return of some five million refugees to
Israel was unfeasible.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan reportedly told a refugees&#146; committee in Gaza that &#147;the
bulk of the refugees don&#146;t want to return anyway, and that many of them are Jordanian
citizens and are content with their present life.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in a threat reflecting the police-State mentality of the PA, he
reportedly told the audience that &#147;whoever opposes us, we&#146;ll break his
head.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, these statements, coupled with the increasingly diluted
and vague phraseology being used by the PA leadership when referring to the right of
return (such as substituting the right of return with phrases like &#147;just
solution&#148; and &#147;equitable settlement&#148;) suggest that Arafat and all his ilk
are actually kissing goodbye to the right of return, a grand treachery by all standards.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, it is understandable that many PA officials and propagandists will
vehemently deny that none of this is taking place and that the Palestinian stance on the
fundamental issues, the so-called national red lines, remains unchanged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, these and similar statements have been parroted for a very long
time, and they were always proven wrong, as Arafat and his mafia continue unabated on
their downward course.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the PA mouthpieces who routinely utter these denials either
don&#146;t know what is going on in Stockholm, as they didn&#146;t know what had been
going on in Oslo in 1993 until the scandalous scheme became public, or know but can&#146;t
face up to Arafat, the giver of jobs, money and privileges. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These stupid mouthpieces also realize quite well that all decisions
pertaining to the talks with the Zionists are taken by one man, Yasser Arafat, who
didn&#146;t, doesn&#146;t and won&#146;t bother to consult his aides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, Qrei is the speaker of the Palestinian Legislative Council,
and his job is essentially to monitor and hold to account the executive authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, given Qrei&#146;s suspicious role in the Stockholm talks, one is
prompted to wonder how can he be expected to put up any opposition to a prospective
sell-out of Palestinian rights by Arafat? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, it seems that the Legislative Council is an accomplice to the
brewing crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is likely that Arafat would seek in the next few months to obtain a
&#147;a ratification&#148; of the expected sell-out from the so-called PLO institutions,
including the Central Council, the Palestine National Council and the PLO Executive
Committee.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Would the Palestinian people come to terms with this grand treachery in
the name of peace?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answer is a clarion &#147;no&#148;, no matter how large the duress,
how inducing the bribery or how harsh the repression.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And should it reach the point of imposing the capitulatory deal by force,
Arafat and his groups would just be treated as quislings&#133;very much like the defunct
South Lebanese Army. </p>
