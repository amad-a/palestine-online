<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians warn Arafat against crossing red
lines</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - </b>Leaders of the refugees in the Gaza Strip have
issued a stern warning to Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat against tampering
with the refugees&#146; right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The warning was made during a heated debate in Gaza on 13 May during which
several refugee activists and political figures from Jabalya and other refugee camps in
Gaza told Palestinian Authority officials that &#147;the right of return is our ultimate
red line and that nobody, including Yasser Arafat, will be allowed to cross it.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to impeccable sources in Gaza, the leaders of the refugees
became extremely angry when the PA security chief in Gaza, Muhammed Dahlan, remarked,
rather extemporaneously, that the fulfilment of the refugees&#146; right of return was
unfeasible and that alternatives ought to be explored.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Upon hearing these remarks, there was an uproar in the hall where the
debate took place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan&#146;s remarks were scathingly attacked by virtually all the
attendants, who accused him of playing with fire and providing the Zionists, who are
striving to negate the right of return, with a great service.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One source intimated that Dahlan remarked that &#147;the remaining issue
with the Israeli government is the future of Jerusalem&#148; and that &#147;the refugee
issue is no longer a problem because the return of the estimated 5 million Palestinian
refugees from abroad is not feasible.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the source, Dahlan also remarked that &#147;Palestinian
refugees in Jordan will not leave Jordan since the huge majority are citizens and that
Palestinians are content in neighbouring Syria as well.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When participants from the Arab refugee committee challenged him to make
his views public, Dahlan reportedly became exasperated, telling the leaders of the
refugees to &#147;do whatever you like after a decision is made&#148; and &#147;we will
break the heads of all oppositionists.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Dahlan&#146;s remarks created an uproar in the PA itself.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A senior PA military officer, who reportedly obtained the text of
Dahlan&#146;s remarks, raised the matter during a Palestinian National Security meeting
which included the PA cabinet as well as the chiefs of the estimated 10 security agencies
answerable to Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Officer Omar Ashour complained to Arafat that Dahlan was making &#147;very
serious statements and that he should be stopped immediately.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat reportedly told Ashour that Dahlan was not authorized to say what
he said and that the PA stance on the question of the refugees remained unchanged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear yet if what Dahlan said was a slip of the tongue on his
part, or if he was acting as a mouthpiece for Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, most Palestinian observers believe that Dahlan couldn&#146;t have
said what he said without Arafat&#146;s tacit approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are several indicators corroborating this view.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, some observers argue, has been shunning emphatic references to
United Nations resolution 194, which grants the refugees repatriation and restitution. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, the PA leader has increasingly been using terms such as
&#147;just solution&#148;, &#147;acceptable solution&#148; and &#147;equitable
solution&#148; when talking about the refugees, but without stressing that these solutions
would have to be based on UN resolution 149.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That resolution, needless to say, remains the essence of international
legitimacy on this issue, and ignoring, diluting or blurring the said resolution would be
an act of striking political stupidity bordering on national treachery on the part of the
PA leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This view was voiced recently by Abdullah al-Hurani, one of the prominent
PA officials in charge of the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out on 21 May that &#147;nobody, including Yasser Arafat, is
authorized to concede on the refugees&#146; right of return.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The right of return,&#148; he said, &#147;is personal, inalienable
and absolute in nature.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;it would be unthinkable for us to concede on this
paramount right&#133;that would be like a national suicide.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hurani, like most Palestinians, recognized that the actual implementation
of the right of return was extremely difficult and might even be out of the question,
given the current Israeli attitudes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, he argued that inability to realize and embody that right now
must in no way lead us to concede on it or accept settling the refugees in the host
countries.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>That would be an act of national perfidy,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Dahlan himself, probably after sensing the angry reactions to his
reported remarks, effectively backed off from what was attributed to him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 22 May, his office issued a statement denying that he had ever
suggested that the right of return should be compromised.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He described reports to that effect as &#147;cynical attempts by
suspicious parties to distort the Palestinian stance on the matter.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the refugees&#146; right of return was &#147;a sacred right&#148;
and that &#147;the Palestinian Authority was still committed to resolving the refugee
issue in accordance with UN resolution 194.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, irrespective of the veracity or falsity of Dahlan&#146;s remarks
and subsequent clarification, one thing seems to be amply clear: the refugee issue defies
political manoeuvring and political wheeling and dealing. For peace and stability in the
region would mainly depend on the resolution of this enduring human tragedy in accordance
with pertinent UN resolutions, particularly resolution 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, if the refugees are not allowed to return to their
ancestral homeland, any peace arrangement between Israel and a prospective Palestinian
entity would be precarious at best.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the refugees are the root cause of the problem, and only through
treating that root cause, effectively and satisfactorily, can the problem be overcome. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sporadic clashes between heavily armed Israeli occupation soldiers and
Palestinian protestors erupted last month, with Palestinians hurling stones at the Zionist
soldiers and the latter responding with live ammunition, rubber-coated metal bullets,
tear-gas shells and stun grenades.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As of 22 May, at least five Palestinians have been killed by Israeli
bullets and as many as 1,500 people injured, mostly by rubber-coated bullets and gas
inhalation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two other Palestinian children from the northern town of Qalkilya were
killed on 16 May reportedly after being hit by a racing car driven by a Jewish settler.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, it was thought the incident was a normal traffic accident.
However, the investigation into the incident revealed that the settler ran over them
deliberately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The number of Palestinian casualties as a result of the current spate of
violence is expected to rise even further as many of the injured sustained serious wounds
in the upper parts of their bodies, especially in the area of the head and chest.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospital sources in the West Bank pointed out that at least five people
were in critical condition and that they were fighting for their lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, on 20 May another Palestinian succumbed to the serious wounds he
sustained the previous day in violent clashes with occupation soldiers in the Ramallah
region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As many as 20 Israeli army soldiers were injured in the clashes; one of
them, a high-ranking officer, reportedly sustained serious gunshot wounds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another soldier was also seriously wounded in the Gaza Strip on 19 May,
prompting the Zionist regime to lodge a strongly worded protest with the PA leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The violence escalated dramatically on 15 May (which marked the 51<sup>st</sup>
anniversary of the Palestinian Nakba&#150;the loss of Palestine to the Zionists and the
expulsion and displacement of the bulk of its Arab population when Israel was created in
1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And unlike the previous days, which witnessed a number of relatively
peaceful protests and rallies in solidarity with the prisoners, live ammunition was used
on many occasions, causing the high number of casualties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was probably the worst and the bloodiest since the 1996 clashes which
erupted following the opening of a subterranean tunnel beneath the Aqsa Mosque by the
Israeli government of Benyamin Netanyahu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, at one point the entire West Bank looked like a large battlefield,
with hospitals placed on an emergency footing to receive a seemingly unceasing influx of
injuries resulting from the widespread clashes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the four Palestinians killed was a policeman who was killed by
Israeli soldiers outside the West Bank of Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli army sources accused PA security personnel of taking part in the
clashes and of firing at Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA sources admitted that some policemen were indeed involved in the
clashes, but said they only fired in self-defence when they were fired upon by the
Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The 19<sup>th</sup> of May was declared a &#147;Palestinian Day of
Wrath,&#148; and violent clashes took place all over the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The clashes assumed the same pattern of Palestinian protestors hurling
stones at Zionist soldiers manning roadblocks and checkpoints, and the latter responding
with bullets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At least one Palestinian died and as many as 150 were injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At one point, the Israeli army threatened to bomb the PA headquarters in
Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli commander of the West Bank told journalists that at one point,
&#147;We thought we were going to order our Cobras to the air to destroy the PA
headquarters in Ramallah.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">U.S. envoy Dennis Ross ,who arrived on 19 May in Palestine in an effort to
extinguish the fire, did not make much of an impact on the protestors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the Palestinian anger, indignation and disenchantment seemed too
deep-rooted to be stemmed by an order from Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This seemed even more so with Israel refusing to release the prisoners or
even improve their internment conditions.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA aide rejects Israeli accusation</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA blamed Israel for the eruption of violence. Tayeb Abdul Rahim, a
senior aide to PA Chairman Yasser Arafat, rejected the Israeli accusation that the PA
organized the riots in order to extract political concessions from Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He argued that it was Israel who bore full responsibility for the
violence, adding that &#147;they are pushing us to the brink. The Israelis should realize
that our patience has limits,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody events were originally precipitated by a hunger strike declared
by the estimated 1,700 Palestinian prisoners locked in Israeli jails. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The strike, which began on 1 May, is continuing, with several
hunger-strikers having already been taken to hospital for urgent treatment. And there are
real fears that should any of the prisoners die as a result of the strike, violence could
erupt again and even increase in scope and intensity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the prisoners&#146; cause is commanding widespread support and
sympathy among all Palestinians irrespective of their political and ideological
affiliation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Without freeing the prisoners, there is no point in talking about
peace,&#148; said Marwan al-Barghouthi, head of Fatah&#146;s Supreme Council in the West
Bank. He hinted that the masses were no longer trusting the PA&#146;s handling of the
issue of the prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;All the agreements signed with the Israelis stipulated the release
of the prisoners, but Israel has deliberately refused to release them,&#148; said a
frustrated Barghouthi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has indeed refused to release prisoners, arguing that they have
&#147;Jewish blood&#148; on their hands, or they are affiliated with the Islamic
movements, such as Hamas and the Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians strongly denounce the Israeli rationale as bluntly racist
and often ask in frustration and bitterness about Israeli soldiers and settlers who have
Palestinian blood on their hands and whether Jewish blood is redder than Palestinian
blood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA leaders also question the Israeli logic of keeping the prisoners
behind bars at a time when Israel has been talking with the very PLO leaders who had given
the prisoners the orders to attack Israeli targets, for which they are being imprisoned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the real motive behind the continued incarceration of the
prisoners&#150;many of them having been in jail for up to a quarter of a century&#150;is
Israel&#146;s rapacious desire to use them as bargaining chips in future talks with the
PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The current Palestinian intifadah is aimed at pressing the Israeli
government to meet at least some of the prisoners&#146; demands, including an end to
punitive solitary confinement and midnight raids, and again allow family visits.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But it is also a symptom of deep Palestinian disenchantment with a peace
process that failed to achieve any of the Palestinian aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the violence could also convince Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak that he ought to give more serious thought to Palestinian demands concerning the
final status issues such as Jerusalem and the refugees, since ignoring these demands would
almost certainly trigger renewed violence on a very large scale. On the Palestinian side,
the bloody event is expected to bring some temporary relief to a Palestinian leadership
that is increasingly besieged by a host of domestic troubles ranging from an ongoing
strike by teachers over a pay raise to mounting criticisms over a chronically dismal
record of human rights and civil liberties violations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA must also hope that the latest events will enhance its
&#147;negotiating stance&#148; by demonstrating to the Israeli side that the Palestinians
are more than just Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in the words of an Israeli analyst, Arafat will now be able to tell
Barak that he, too, has domestic problems and that he can&#146;t accept a deal that would
be unacceptable to his people.</p>

regime is a form of prostitution</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interview by Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><em>Sakher Habash is widely considered one of the leading intellectual
godfathers of Fatah, the mainstream PLO faction and the political backbone of Yasser
Aafat&#146;s Palestinian Authority. At 62, Habash today leads the internal opposition
within Fatah to PA President Yasser Arafat&#146;s seemingly unbridled willingness to
conclude a deformed &#147;peace deal&#148; with the Zionist regime that would fall
seriously short of achieving the very minimum of the legitimate Palestinian rights,
including the sacred right of return for the refugees and the restoration of East
Jerusalem to Arab sovereignty. <b>Palestine Times</b> spoke with him at his office in
Ramallah. The following are excerpts of what he said.</em></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question</b>: Who is Sakher Habash?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer</b>: I am a Palestinian who was born in the village of Beit Dajan
in 1939. Beit Dajan was a Palestinian village near Jaffa with a population of about 4,000,
all of them Muslims. I am a member of a family that consisted of nine children&#150;five
boys and four girls&#150;and in terms of seniority, I was fourth. Two of my brothers
(Muhammed and Ahmed) were martyred&#150;Ahmed in a car wreck in Nablus in 1969 and
Muhammed was a known martyr who died while launching an attack with a rocket on the
settlement of Petah Tekva in 1971.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you remember how life was in Beit Dajan before the Nakba?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Beit Dajan was like a rallying point for the Mujahideen in the
region and fighters used to meet at the village to plan operations against Zionist
colonies like Rishon Letzion, Hazbun and Nisher. So we were in a sense a front-line
village. I remember that one day my father, who worked at a citrus orchard, I and a two
other villagers were riding in a car, and when we approached a Jewish roadblock, the
soldiers there opened fire at us, killing the woman who was sitting next to me and
injuring me slightly in the leg. That incident taught me that a man will not die before
his time comes. I was worried that my leg would be amputated, but I recuperated, thanks to
God, and returned to play soccer.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you remember how the inhabitants of Beit Dajan were expelled
from the village?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The people began to dig trenches around the village to repulse
Zionist attacks in light of the fact that Beit Dajan was located near an intersection
linking a number of Jewish settlements in the area. We were told then that the Arab legion
would hasten to our aid , but that aid never came. And at that time, the massacre of Deir
Yassin took place, and the villagers thought they would be slaughtered if they didn&#146;t
leave.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Was the conflict with the Jews religious in nature? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Most of the villagers were religious, and they fought behind the
Mufti of Jerusalem, Haj Amin al-Husseini. Among the field commanders was a man by the name
of Yahya Alnatur who always called for brotherhood between Christians and Muslims.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Was the Mufti a religious figure? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: He was a Palestinian nationalist.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did the village have political movements? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes. There was the Muslim Brotherhood, but the religious ideology
was not very much conspicuous.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Many of the Palestinian population did not flee, why didn&#146;t
you stay? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: There were two main reasons: First, there was a Jewish plan to
depopulate most of the Palestinian villages, especially those located in the Palestinian
heartland. Beit Dajan was supposed to be part of the &#147;Arab State&#148;, according to
the Partition Resolution, hence they decided to overtake it. Second, many people were
worried that the Zionists would rape their women and daughters, and there were indeed many
rumours to that effect, prompting people to flee to save their honour. The people of Beit
Dajan fled to the nearby village of Alsafriyyeh, but once we arrived there we found its
inhabitants had already fled the village.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Weren&#146;t the Arabs aware of the Zionist plan to depopulate the
villages? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, they weren&#146;t. There was a mass escape as early as
mid-April 1948, and we were supposed to find shelter in the village of Emous, near Lud,
but again we found it completely depopulated.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Was there the element of conspiracy in what happened? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Certainly. When King Abdullah of Jordan visited Ramallah, nobody
received him, as many people came to realize that our land was handed over to the enemy by
treacherous Arab leaders.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did you stay in Ramallah? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: We stayed in Ramallah for some time before we moved to the Nablus
area where we were temporarily sheltered at a refugee camp called Balata. It is still
there. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: How did you enter political life?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: My political activities began in 1952, and the political parties in
the Palestinian arena then were the Muslim Brotherhood, the Ba&#146;ath party and the
Liberation Party&#150;the first led by George Habash and the second by Sheikh Takkiy
al-Din al-Nabhani. I joined the Ba&#146;ath party but my brother had a religious
orientation.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: I understand you had a story with geology? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: When I used to play soccer at Khadouri (near Tulkarm), when I
looked westward I saw that the land was verdant and green but when I looked eastward the
land was barren and arid. I questioned why and was told that the Jews usurped and stole
our water. This made me decide to study geology and specialize in water, which I did at
the Ein Shams University in Cairo in 1958.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did you stay at Hizbul Ba&#146;ath? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, the party dissolved itself in that year after the declaration
of the Egyptian-Syrian unity.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: And then what happened to you?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I began to harbour new ideas, a mix of Palestinian nationalism,
Pan-Arab nationalism and Islam. This is what we today call Fatah.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did any of your family members join the Muslim Brotherhood? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, my brother Mahmoud was Ikhwanji (a brother).</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: At the university in Cairo, was Yasser Arafat your colleague? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, Arafat had just graduated when I entered college.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: When did you join Fatah? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: In 1962, when it was first formed by Arafat and a number of
Palestinian students.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Was Arafat a member of the Muslim Brothers? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, in reality he wasn&#146;t, but others were.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What was the idea of Fatah? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The idea was that the liberation of Palestine was a Palestinian,
Arab, Muslim and human duty, hence anybody could join the movement irrespective of their
faith or ideology.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is Islam Fatah&#146;s ideology? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, it isn&#146;t.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is the strife with the Zionists religious in nature? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, otherwise I would have joined the Ikhwan.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Does Fatah&#146;s secular nature allow a Jew to join it? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, and we did have a Jew with us by the name of Ahudia Reef.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you support the creation of an Islamic State in Palestine? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I don&#146;t demand this, I just demand the closure of the Casino
in Jericho. But when the people become prepared for an Islamic State, then I accept an
Islamic State. But in any case, I wouldn&#146;t like to see a State like that in
Afghanistan.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do you fight for Palestine or for God? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Fighting for Palestine is fighting for God.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What do you think about &#147;normalization&#148; with the
Zionists? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: This is not normalization, it is subservience. After all, we and
Israel are not normal, and you can&#146;t normalize between two abnormal entities.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: We often hear of &#147;normalization conferences&#148; in which
members of Fatah take part, what do you think about this?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The Peres Centre for Peace in Tel Aviv is one of the most dangerous
conspiracies being devised against the Palestinian people. And those people who go there
don&#146;t represent Fatah but rather themselves as their visits there are aimed at having
relations with Jewish prostitutes.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: This is a serious charge.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: I said this at the Central Council in front of Yasser Arafat.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What about political internees in PA jails? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: As a Palestinian and a poet, I don&#146;t believe in political
detention, and when an Islamist is arrested, I often try to ask Arafat to get him
released. The problem is that there are certain people around Arafat who continually seek
to push things to the crisis point.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Who are those? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: These are the Baramika (the fifth column).</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Does the U.S. play a part in the phenomenon of political
internment? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Of course, and Arafat knows that.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What is your view of the Oslo Accords? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The accords were reached behind my back&#133;.Even the closest
people to Arafat didn&#146;t know about the accords.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Why didn&#146;t you contest the election in 1996? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Because I didn&#146;t believe in Oslo.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What is the most important thing for you now? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The right of return.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: And if that right is denied? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: The conflict will remain.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What do you think about the &#147;martyrdom operations&#148;? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: This idea does not exist in Fatah.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did you take part in the battle of Karama? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, I was responsible for recruitment.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Did the late King Hussein of Jordan really put up a fight then? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, he used it when he found that it was inevitable.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: It is said that Arafat was offered a high-ranking job in Jordan in
1970.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, King Hussein himself asked Yasser Arafat to form the
government. He refused, saying I am not here to rule Jordan but to liberate Palestine.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Why did the PLO make all that trouble in Jordan? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: That was a tragedy. The American policy in that era saw that any
Arab regime hosting the Palestinian revolution must get rid of them or the U.S. would get
rid of that regime.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Were you the real rulers of Jordan? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: No, no. It was, in a sense, like here where the Israelis really
rule, not us. It is true that we had close coordination with the government of Jordan, but
we didn&#146;t rule Jordan.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: But Abu Ammar (Arafat) always used to say &#147;I ruled
Lebanon.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: He was saying that in the metaphorical sense only.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: The Palestinian High Court issued scores of rulings and decisions
to release political detainees, but we see no implementation, why?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Because the rule of law doesn&#146;t exist here. We are not free to
do anything; I am not free, you are not free and even Arafat can&#146;t leave Gaza without
Israeli consent.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Would you accept Abu Dis as the capital instead of Jerusalem? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Never.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What if Arafat accepted that? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Then the oppositionists would have to fight.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Will Oslo enable the refugees to return? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: It is supposed to.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: What are your red lines? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Our rights are guaranteed through United Nations resolutions 242
and 338 as well as resolution 194, which pertains to the refugees&#133;and also resolution
181.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Is Israel interested in creating chaos in the West Bank, Gaza?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, and the American ambassador to Israel, Martin Indyk, is
leading these efforts, and we had information that they planned to kill Arafat using a
laser to foment trouble and chaos.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q</b>: Do we have a safety valve? </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A</b>: Yes, it is Arafat and the &#147;understanding between Fatah and
Islamist forces.&#148;</p>

this summer?<br>
</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By&nbsp; Palestine Time's press time,&nbsp; the Zionist regime&nbsp; and
the self-rule<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Authority were about
to resume their &quot;secret&quot; talks in Stockholm amid<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>conflicting statements from both sides
on whether any progress was made in the crucial talks, seen by many as the last real
chance for reaching a framework agreement on the so-called final status issues which
include such knotty questions as the refugees, Jerusalem, and the borders of a prospective
Palestinian entity on the West Bank and Gaza Strip.<br>
The talks were publicly suspended on 21 May when Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak
summoned his delegates, Odid Eran and Egal Shahar, from the Swedish capital to show his
displeasure with the way the PA President Yasser Arafat&nbsp; handled the bloody
anti-Israeli protests that swept&nbsp; the self-rule enclaves in the first half of May and
left at least six protesters killed and up to a thousand others injured.<br>
However, it seemed that Barak, probably with a strong American urging, decided to resume
the talks, especially after Arafat took somewhat stringent action, including arbitrary
arrests, against &quot;the trouble makers,&quot; who led much of the
&quot;confrontations&quot; with the Israeli army.<br>
Indeed, Arafat instructed his security agencies to carry out a wave of arrests among
&quot;the fomenters&quot; of the disturbances, and even asked that public demonstrations
and rallies in solidarity with the estimated 1650 hunger-striking Palestinian prisoners be
toned down.<br>
Non the less the mere resumption of the talks doesn't seem to suggest that progress is in
the offing, or&nbsp;&nbsp; that both sides were beginning to narrow the inherently wide
gaps between their respective positions.<br>
&quot;Our&nbsp; position remains unchanged and is still based on UN Security council
resolutions 242 and 338 as well as resolution 194 pertaining to the refugees plight,&quot;
said Hasan Asfour, who along with Palestinian<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Legislative Council speaker Ahmed Qrei represent the PA in the talks,
&nbsp; in an interview with the Israeli state-run radio on 29 May.<br>
The same assertion was repeated by&nbsp; Arafat's deputy Mahmud Abbas (Abu<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Mazen)<br>
During a visit to Riyadh on 28 May.<br>
He pointed out that virtually &quot;nothing of substance&quot; had been&nbsp; achieved in
the two prolonged rounds of talks&nbsp; before 21 May.<br>
&quot;The ball&nbsp; is in Israel's court and what is needed is an Israeli decision to
come to terms with UN resolutions,&quot; he said.<br>
In contrast, however, Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Barak, continued to
insist that &quot;significant progress&quot; was being made and that<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>the two sides could begin to &quot;put
into writing&quot; a draft agreement containing the general features of a final status
settlement by mid July.<br>
Shlomo Ben Ami,&nbsp; Israel's&nbsp; Minister for Internal Security who heads the Israeli
delegation to the talks, said on 29 May that &quot;tangible progress&quot; was being made,
and that the two sides were demonstrating &quot;a great deal of seriousness in dealing
with the issues being discussed.&quot;<br>
However, Ben Ami added an extremely significant note.<br>
He said, in a warning fashion, that the Palestinians would have to choose either of two
things: making peace with Israel or insisting on their impossible demands of recovering
all the territories seized&nbsp; in 1967 and expediting the right of&nbsp; return for
&nbsp; the refugees.<br>
Ben Ami's remarks&nbsp; demonstrated that Barak didn't deviate from his so-called
&quot;set of red lines,&quot; which he made in a clarion fashion following his election
victory nearly a year ago.<br>
These include, inter alia:&nbsp; No return to the 1967 borders, Jerusalem remaining
Israel's &quot;eternal and undivided capital,&quot; and Israel wouldn't under any
circumstances accept the return of Palestinian refugees who fled or were expelled from
their towns in what is now Israel when the Jewish state was created in 1948.<br>
Now,&nbsp; if this is Israel's final position, and there is no indication that it is not,
&nbsp; and if&nbsp; the Palestinians ostensibly will not&nbsp; retreat from their own
declared&nbsp; red lines, then what is the point of holding&nbsp; secret talks&nbsp; in
Stockholm, or even public talks&nbsp; in Ramallah or Elat?<br>
The answer is&nbsp; clear. With the Clinton Administration becoming a &quot;lame
duck,&quot; and with Arafat vowing, seemingly seriously this time, to declare Palestinian
statehood in September, the two sides, particularly the vulnerable&nbsp;PA leadership, are
interested in demonstrating to the world at large, particularly to the US,&nbsp; that they
exhausted all efforts to reach an agreement and that the blame for not reaching one lies
squarely on the other side.<br>
So, the two sides are effectively waiting to see who will blink first?<br>
The Israelis are certainly hoping, even expecting,&nbsp;the PA will. On the other
hand,&nbsp;the Palestinians&nbsp;realize quite well&nbsp;that Israel won't, hence the most
they can hope for is that the PA won't.<br>
In fact, there is now a deep collective&nbsp; anxiety engulfing all segments of the
Palestinian people that the autocratic Palestinian leadership, which accepted to go
Stockholm&nbsp; without consulting even the PA's own cabinet, let alone other PLO
institutions,&nbsp; will eventually embark on&nbsp; far-reaching concessions to Israel,
compromising&nbsp; some of the fundamental Palestinian rights and aspirations, all in
return for a state with a form but without much of a substance.<br>
Such concessions would conceivably include accepting a truncated Palestinian mini-state on
60 % of the original West Bank&nbsp; (Israel doesn't recognize East Jerusalem and the
surrounded&nbsp; territory to be part of the West Bank), coming to terms with Israeli
&quot;sovereignty&quot; over East Jerusalem and &quot;forgetting&quot; about the refugees'
right of return.<br>
Needless to say, a deal bearing these features, even if decorated with certain gimmicks
and supplemented with green dollars from the United States to make it look &quot;not so
bad&quot; for the Palestinians, would be viewed as an utter&nbsp; sell-out, even a grand
treason, by the bulk of the Palestinian people, including much of Fatah, Yaser Arafat's
own political backbone.<br>
Only the&nbsp;hardcore &quot;Arafatists&quot; controlling&nbsp;the PA security and
intelligence apparatus would accept such a deal.<br>
Indeed, this is what Yasser Abed Rabbo, the former chief of the Palestinian team to the
final status talks with Israel, exactly sensed&nbsp;when he resigned in anger on 15 May
following the revelation about the secret talks in Stockholm.<br>
He described the&nbsp;Stockholm&nbsp;talks as &quot;an Israeli conspiracy aimed at
extracting fundamental concessions from us.&quot;<br>
Abed Rabbo also alluded that there were &quot;some people&quot; within the Palestinian
leadership who &quot;are willing to concede.&quot;<br>
He, of course, didn't say who&nbsp;these &quot;some people&quot; were, but it was amply<br>
clear that his accusing finger was pointed at&nbsp; no other than his own boss, Yasser
Arafat.<br>
Abed Rabbo's resignation was by no means the only manifestation of indignation&nbsp; at
the Stockholm talks.<br>
Marwan al Barghouthi, head of the Supreme Fatah Council in the West Bank, warned Arafat,
&nbsp; again&nbsp; without mentioning him by name,&nbsp; against &quot;deviating from our
red lines.&quot;<br>
&quot;No Palestinian, leader or otherwise, will dare or be able to compromise the
Palestinian national constants.and in case he does, Fatah and the Palestinian people will
&nbsp; stand against him,&quot; said Barghouthi during an acrimonious debate on the Qatari
satellite television, al Jazira on 26 May.<br>
An even more audacious statement came from Sakher Habash, who is widely considered the
intellectual godfather of Fatah.<br>
He said in an interview with the Palestinian weekly, the Hebron Times, to be published on
31 May, that&nbsp; any concessions to Israel beyond UN resolutions 242 and 338 would be
viewed by Fatah as a form of treason.<br>
&quot;Then the opposition would be justified in carrying arms in the face of whoever
signed the sell-out deal,&quot; he said.<br>
The unusually hard-line statements made by these and other erstwhile Arafat<br>
lieutenants are not bouts of passing anger.<br>
For some time now, there have been sporadic but definite signals that the hardcore of the
PA leadership,&nbsp; which include Arafat and his closest friends&nbsp; (like Abu Mazen,
Nabil Amre, and Muhammed Dahlan) would be willing to strike a deal with Israel
compromising the declared Palestinian position.<br>
For example,&nbsp;Arafat's main security chief in Gaza Muhammed Dahlan reportedly told a
refugee committee in Gaza on 8 May that the only remaining unresolved problem with Israel
was the future of Jerusalem.<br>
When asked about the refugees, he reportedly said &quot;the refugees' issue is no longer a
problem,&quot; adding that &quot;Repatriating&nbsp;five million refugees to Palestine is
unfeasible&quot; and that &quot;many refugees are content with their living
conditions.&quot;<br>
A PA&nbsp;official, Omar Ashur,&nbsp;reportedly complained to Arafat about Dahlan's
remarks. However, the Palestinian leader refused to take any action against
Dahlan,&nbsp;saying that the PA position on this matter remained unchanged.<br>
<br>
<b><u>Palestinians reject Arafat&#146;s autocracy </u><br>
</b>Most Palestinians, however, are increasingly refusing to give Arafat and his aides the
benefit of the doubt, and are speaking out, in an unprecedented&nbsp; openness , against
Arafat's autocracy and despotism, especially in the way he has been handling the talks
with Israel.<br>
And, as always,&nbsp; Arafat's response, or rather reaction, to the mounting verbal
protests has been in line with his characteristic style , namely sending his Preventive
Security and Mukhabarat agents to arrest outspoken critics in the quiet hours before dawn,
very much like the Israelis were (and are still) doing.<br>
On 28,&nbsp; PA police arrested Fathi Barqawi, the chief news editor at the PA run radio,
the Voice of Palestine, reportedly for publicly criticizing the Stockholm talks.<br>
Several other people, most of them affiliated with People's Party and the Popular Front
for the Liberation of Palestine,&nbsp; were also arrested for the same reason.<br>
Even Abu Ali Mustafa, the apparent successor of PFLP leader George Habash (who resigned
earlier this month)&nbsp; was reportedly told to tone down his criticisms of the PA
leadership or else he would face arrest.<br>
These arrests, and the increasing intolerance on the part of PA security agencies of
public dissent,&nbsp; could be ominous signs for things to come, especially if Arafat came
to realize that&nbsp; even the inducement of statehood would be insufficient to mollify
the people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Washington-</b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>The
Zionist lobby in the US has expressed deep concern over the possible downfall of Israeli
premier Ehud Barak as a result of the scandalous withdrawal of Israeli troops from South
Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They described the defeat as<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> &#147;</font>an escape from a bunch of terrorists (Hizbullah) and added that

Likud leader Ariel Sharon, who strongly opposed peace with Syria.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon also rejects any withdrawal from the West Bank, Jerusalem and
