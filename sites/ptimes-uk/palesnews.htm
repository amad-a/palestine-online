<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas-PA relations troubled again</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It seems that Hamas relations with the Palestinian Authority
are destined to face another troublesome episode following what was described
as &quot;the conspiratorial hand-over&quot; on 13 November of two members
of the military wing of Hamas to the Israeli authorities. The two individuals,
Jamal al Hoor and Abdul Rahman Ghuneimat (both members of the reputed Surif
cell, which Israel alleges was responsible for the killing of 10 Israeli
soldiers and civilians), were &quot;abducted&quot; under vague circumstances
by a special IDF unit on the outskirts of Nablus while being transferred
from Hebron to Nablus aboard a Preventive Security car.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to informed Palestinian sources, an Israeli agent
planted inside the PS informed the Israelis of the planned transfer of the
Islamist guerrillas, enabling an IDF undercover unit to snatch al Hoor and
Ghuneimat just outside area (A) within which the PA has (or is supposed
to have) exclusive control. The head of the Israeli army central command
alluded to tacit cooperation with the PS in &quot;capturing the two terrorists.&quot;
In a prompt news conference, Major General Uzi Dayan said an undercover
unit known as Duvedevan captured the two wanted Palestinians after receiving
&igrave;information from a very special source.&icirc; Dayan refused to
elaborate further, but observers here surmise that he may have meant a top
Palestinian security official.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When the news of the incident broke Friday morning, 14
November, Hamas immediately accused the PS of &quot;delivering our two fighters
to the hands of our enemy,&quot; adding rather ominously that &quot;you
will pay dearly for your treachery.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas' senior spokesman in Gaza, Abdul Aziz al Rantisi,
held the PA &quot;fully responsible for this disgraceful act of perfidy.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Whether it was an act of connivance, a manifest hand-over,
a tacit deal, or a criminal negligence resulting from Israeli informers
penetrating the PS, the PA is responsible and must pay for that,&quot; he
said in a telephone interview on 15 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Rantisi refused to say explicitly that the PA
did deliver the two Islamist guerrillas into the hands of the Shabak.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The relatively mild reactions from Gaza apparently were
not sufficient to calm down the fury of the Islamist leaders in the West
Bank, particularly Hebron. And for the first time, Hamas founder Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin was criticized, though not harshly, for being &quot;too conciliatory
toward the PA.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We will not agree to sacrifice our own brothers for
the sake of an illusive national unity,&quot; said a furious relative of
Ibrahim Ghuneimat, during an angry demonstration in Hebron on 16 November
against the alleged hand-over. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demonstrators, who came mainly from the village of
Surif to which the two guerrillas belong, lashed out at the PA as never
before, shouting slogans like &quot;Arafat is (Israeli) collaborator,&quot;
&quot;Jebril (PS chief Jebril Rajoub) is jasus (spy), and sulta (PA) is
an Israeli puppet.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We want to know exactly what happened and who was
involved in this treacherous act...was it a practical translation of security
cooperation between Rajoub and the Shabak,&quot; said Ahmed al Hoor, a relative
of Jamal al Hoor, before a crowd of more than 1,000 demonstrators, along
with hundreds of PA security personnel who were lookon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that &quot;we warned him (Rajoub) against transferring
our brothers to Nablus because the Israelis were after them, but he arrogantly
refused to listen to us.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, hundreds of Surif villagers sought to force their
way into the PA headquarters in Hebron, demanding the &quot;release of Ibrahim
Ghuneimat (a third cell member still in PA detention in Hebron) and the
immediate resignation of Jebril Rajoub.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 18 November, the Hamas military wing, Ezzidin al Qassam
Squads, distributed a leaflet in parts of the West Bank, vowing to &quot;respond
sooner rather than later to Rajoub's disgraceful act.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Our response will be human bombs against the Zionist
enemy,&quot; said the leaflet.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet also said &quot;the delivery of our brave fighters
to the enemy's hands was in implementation of security coordination and
cooperation with Israel...and a clear proof that the heads of PA security
agencies are merely representatives of the Israeli intelligence within the
autonomous enclaves.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the leaflet reiterated earlier charges that &quot;Rajoub
went ahead with the &quot;planned hand-over&quot; despite unmistakable warnings
from the two activists themselves, their families, and Islamist leaders
in the West Bank.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Clearly embarrassed by the affair, PA officials sought
to turn the heat on the Israeli government &quot;which doesn't always respect
agreements.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This act of piracy and thievery is indicative of
the entire behaviour of the Israeli government,&quot; said chief Palestinian
negotiator Saeb Ereikat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For his part, PS chief Jebril Rajoub remained reticent
on the matter. On 16 November, following repeated requests for his reaction
to charges of a tacit hand-over of the two Hamas members, Rajoub instructed
his secretary to issue a laconic statement describing &quot;the charges
and rumors of a hand-over as silly and laughable.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement likened &quot;the act of piracy&quot; to
the Mossad&iacute;s bungled assassination attempt on the life of Hamas chief
Khalid Misha'al in Amman last September. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the statement recognized that &quot;there may
have been a crack within our rank and file, enabling the Israelis to locate
the car and abduct the two detainees.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub has been lately exposed to mounting criticisms from
fellow Fatah members who accused him of displaying &quot;scornful behaviour
toward PA officials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, his membership in Fatah's higher council, was
frozen for 45 days following the disclosure of a letter he had sent to fellow
member, Sakhre Habash, in which he reportedly called him &quot;a male prostitute.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The letter, say Fatah insiders, was only the latest in
a series of scandalous incidents in which he displayed &quot;bullying behaviours,
brutality and utter lack of civility&quot; towards junior and even some
senior PA officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, Palestinians continued to protest the continued
detention by Israel of Islamic Jihad activist Itaf Alliyan who was arrested
by Israeli soldiers at a roadblock while travelling from Bethlehem to Abu
Dis near Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Alliyan has been on a hunger strike ever since her detention
end-October, and Palestinian sources said her health &quot;is in real danger.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 11 November, Israeli soldiers protecting a Jewish religious
celebration outside the Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque (known by Jews as Rachel's
Tomb) shot and seriously wounded a 7-year-old child who was returning home
from school.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to witnesses, Ali al Jawarish, a first-grader,
waved his hand to an Israeli soldier whom he thought was photographing him.
The soldier, apparently a sniper, shot him in the head, causing irreparable
damage to his brain. Jawarish, who had been in a deep coma, died on 15 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli army spokesman said Israeli soldiers were trying
to quell Palestinian rioters when the child crossed into the line of fire.
The IDF statement was another shameless attempt to escape blame for killing
an innocent child on the grounds that &quot;it was the child who hit the
bullet not the other way around.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Jawarish family decided to donate their dead son's
organs for transplantation. His father, Muhammad Jawarish, said he didn't
care whether the organs would go to an Arab or a Jew.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Who are the real terrorists?</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli soldiers kill 7-year-old child in
Bethlehem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Bethlehem- by Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He was returning from school, eager to show mummy and daddy
the good marks his teacher gave him that day. But, he never made it to his
home, which is &quot;just around the corner&quot; because a hateful bullet
fired by an Israeli soldier, a beast in the shape of a human being, promptly
ended his life. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The little hands of Ali al Jawarish, a first-grader, didn't
throw stones at or on or toward anybody. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He could barely carry his school bag, after all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Surely, he didn't endanger the lives of any of the trigger-happy
Israeli soldiers on the rooftops. Nor did he pose any risk to War Minister
Yitzhak Mordechai and other Jewish dignitaries who came to celebrate a religious
holiday outside the arrogated Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque in Bethlehem on that
fateful day last month. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Little Ali, apparently, didn't know what was going on.
He raised his hand, as kids everywhere do, thinking the Israeli sniper who
was actually pointing his gun towards him was holding a camera and about
to photograph him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the soldier, who had been taught and indoctrinated
to believe that Arabs, young and old, are expendable, pulled the trigger,
hitting innocent Ali in the head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The bullet pierced Ali's head, causing irreversible brain
damage. Six days later in hospital, Ali was pronounced &quot;clinically
dead&quot; and succumbed to his wound.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ali is not the first Palestinian child killed callously
and unnecessarily (How can one ever justify killing a child?) by Israeli
soldiers. According to human rights organizations, over 350 children below
the age of 13 have been killed by the Israeli army since 1987. The real
total of injuries among children may be ten- or twenty-fold as many.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The death of Ali is not going to make big headlines in
the Washington Post or the New York Times. CNN anchormen and chief broadcasters
are not going to bombard Benyamin Netanyahu and Yitzhak Mordechai with questions
about Ali's death. And indeed, the community of &quot;civilized&quot; nations,
chief among which is the United States, will not call for an urgent conference
to discuss Israeli terrorism, as was the case at Sharm al Sheikh in Egypt
in the Spring of 1996.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For Ali is a Palestinian, a third-worlder, &quot;a child
of a lesser God,&quot; or as many Israelis are brought up to believe, &quot;expendable.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What a hypocritical world?</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Al-Aqsa killer goes free</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In what is a clear proof that Israeli legal &quot;justice&quot;
is based on the national and ethnic origin of the person, American-born
Alan Goodman was released from prison and sent on his way to the U.S. This
is the same man who shot his way into Al-Aqsa Mosque in April 1982, killing
two Moslem worshippers and injuring nine more. Goodman was taken to Ben
Gurion Airport last month after serving 16 years in prison and put on a
flight to the U.S. The killer reportedly never showed any remorse for his
actions and was seen last year trying to reenter Al-Haram Al-Sharif, the
third holiest site in Islam, during one of his weekend releases from prison.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Goodman was suspected of being part of the Jewish underground
that waged a war of terrorism and violence in the West Bank from 1978-1984.
The underground was made up of soldiers and West Bank settlers who placed
bombs in markets, attacked and killed innocent students at the Hebron University,
bombed the cars of West Bank mayors, booby-trapped mosques and churches,
and generally used whatever forms of violence available against innocent
Arabs as part of their effort to ensure Israel did not make peace with its
neighbours. Most of the underground were religious Jews who believed that
the Messiah could not come from Heaven without first rebuilding the Jewish
Temple on the site where Al-Aqsa and the Dome of the Rock now stand as the
centre-piece to Jerusalem. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Goodman said then that his assault on Al-Aqsa was an effort
to &quot;return&quot; the walled enclave to the Jewish people. His machine-gun
attack sparked large demonstrations in the West Bank that left several Palestinians
dead and many more injured. Other attacks by the Jewish underground on Al-Haram
Al-Sharif continued until the arrests of 40 members in 1984. Even today,
there are daily acts of provocation and violence by militant Jews around
Al-Aqsa who are seeking to remove the Islamic sites for the sake of rebuilding
the Temple.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In an interview with the Yediot Ahronot newspaper, Goodman,
53, was quoted as saying he did not regret the killings but hoped &quot;to
live the rest of my life in quiet and peace.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, the two elderly men, who Goodman killed
cold-bloodedly, do not have this same chance to live in peace and quite.
It is also ironic that Israel, which still holds 5,000 Palestinian political
prisoners, many of whom have been imprisoned without charges or trial, can
release a man who not only murdered innocent people, but also shows no remorse
for his actions. A Palestinian youth can throw a stone at a soldier occupying
his homeland and suffer a much worse fate than the murdering Goodman. His
release is further proof that in Israeli courts and legal system, there
is one set of rules for Palestinians and another for Jews. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Islamists Condemn Egypt Tourist
Carnage</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Islamists have strongly condemned the 17 November
massacre of foreign tourists in Egypt, which claimed 67 victims, saying
the carnage &quot;was absolutely incompatible with the sublime teachings
of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas founder and principal leader, Sheikh Ahmed Yassin,
issued a statement denouncing the &quot;terrible killing as absolutely incompatible
with the sublime teachings of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement, released by the Hamas information office
in Gaza on 18 November, said, &quot;it was highly possible that suspicious
and strange hands were behind such crimes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the statement said Hamas rejected in the past
and rejects now attacks on foreigners visiting Muslim countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Hamed al Beitawi, widely considered the second-most
prominent Palestinian Islamist figure after Yassin, also condemned the incident
in strong terms.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This carnage contradicts diametrically Islamic ethics
and laws which prohibits the killing of innocent people.&quot; Al Beitawi
quoted a Quranic verse to that effect: &quot;Thou shall not kill...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Beitawi, who is a high-ranking judge, said &quot;these
repugnant actions are un-Islamic and distort the image of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub strongly denounced the carnage,
saying, &quot;these actions are totally unacceptable, first because they
are incompatible with the Sharia (Islamic law), and second because they
besmirch the image of Islam.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And like other Islamist leaders, Rajoub voiced doubts that
&quot;hostile elements may well be behind these actions.&quot; Rajoub, say
his friends, is a very influential Islamic leader in the southern part of
the West Bank, and his words carry a definite weight.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Gaza, Sayyed Abu Musamih, a top Hamas leader, said Muslims
in Palestine as everywhere &quot;view with repugnance and disbelief the
killing of innocent people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He said Hamas wanted to see &quot;a stable, strong and
prosperous Egypt because that would be beneficial for the collective interests
of Muslims.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Jihad movement also condemned the slaughter.
The movement&iacute;s spokesman, Abdullah al Shami, said the killing of
tourists contradicted the Islamic and humanist principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic movement in Palestine, which is part of the
worldwide Muslim Brotherhood, generally rejects the use of violence to topple
secular regimes throughout the Muslim world. The rationale behind this stance
is that violence could result in more harm than good unto Muslims.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA sources: Israeli army escalated encroachment
on area &quot;A&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem &shy;PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli army has escalated raids and forays into PA-held
towns in the West Bank in blunt violation of the Oslo Accords, Palestinian
sources said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron Police Chief Tareq Zeid said Israeli penetration
(by soldiers and settlers) of (H-1), those parts of Hebron administered
by the PA, has become a recurrent and &quot;almost a daily phenomenon.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This week alone (first week of November), Israeli
soldiers and settlers encroached on our area three times for the clear purpose
of provoking Palestinians into throwing stones at them, forcing the Israeli
soldiers in turn to re-invade the area under our control,&quot; said Zeid.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 8 November, hundreds of Jewish settlers rioted along
Shallala Street, referred to half-jokingly by local Palestinians as the
&quot;armistice line,&quot; shouting anti-Arab slogans and demanding the
Israeli government &quot;to retake Hebron, the city of our forefathers.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settlers, who demonstrated and went on a rampage in
full view of regular Israeli army soldiers, also shouted, &quot;We don't
want to be confined to a ghetto.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the heavily armed settlers
attacked a Palestpoliceman with stones, causing him a grave injury in the
head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The recurrent penetration of settlers and undercover Israeli
soldiers is being met with mounting Palestinian exasperation with what one
Palestinian called &quot;the utter futility and nonsense of the (H-1) &shy;
(H-2) division.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Look, they are making mockery of our 'sovereignty'
within our area...they (Israeli soldiers and settlers) violate the agreement
almost on a daily basis and we still claim that Hebron is liberated,&quot;
marvelled a downtown Hebron shopkeeper who opted for anonymity. Zeid concurred,
though with an ameliorated tone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These encroachments are not happening incidentally.
They are manifestations of a deliberate Israeli policy aimed at dismantling
the Hebron agreement and reoccupying the town,&quot; said Zeid, recalling
a recent statement by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu not ruling
out the possibility of the IDF retaking Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Hebron police chief added that &quot;in order for these
provocative acts to stop, a political decision from the Israeli government
is needed.&quot; When asked if he saw that decision forthcoming, he didn't
hesitate to say &quot;not at all.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron, is not the only place where encroachments on PA-administered
territory are carried out by the Israeli army and its under-cover units.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources point out that Israeli soldiers, disguising
themselves as Arabs, have been carrying out nightly raids on homes of Islamic
activists in many localities where the PA is supposed to be in full or partial
control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three months ago, an Israeli army under-cover unit raided
the PA-controlled town of Tulkarm, abducting an Islamic Jihad activist in
full daylight. Similar incidents also took place in Bethlehem, Nablus, Bani
Naeim and Dura.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two years ago, when PA Chairman Yasser Arafat arrived in
the West Bank, he declared each town that was handed over to the PA &quot;liberated,
liberated, liberated.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, in light of the recurrent Israeli army and settlers'
forced re-entry into these towns, many Palestinians have come to view Arafat's
proclamations merely as &quot;lamentable rhetorical overindulgence.&quot;</FONT></P>

call for their release</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Relatives of Jordanian
prisoners in Israeli jails on 22 November staged a sit-in, mostly women
and children, carried placards and pictures of their relatives imprisoned
in Israel and urged the Jordan government to exercise pressure on the Jewish
state to release their relatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Plainclothes and anti-riot police surrounded the participants
and detained one of them, but only to release him after 15 minutes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Five representatives of the protesters were allowed to
meet with Deputy Prime Minister Dr. Abdulla Ensour to brief him on the plight
of Jordanian prisoners who remain in Israeli jails.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdulla Atiya, head of the committee for the release of
prisoners, said that they have a list of 17 Jordanian prisoners in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Atiya, who was speaking to reporters following his
meeting with Dr. Ensour, said that they received a pledge from the government
that additional efforts will be exerted to secure the release of their relatives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jordanian minister of state for information affairs Samir
Mutawi said on 22 November that the Jordanian government will exercise &quot;maximum
efforts to release Jordanian detainees in Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;There must be some reasons behind Israel's delay
to release Jordanian prisoners. We will enquire about these reasons and
work hard to overcome all hurdles that prevent their release,&quot; Dr.
Mutawi said.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Burned boy gets treatment in U.S.</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Special to Palestine Times</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amar Emeera is too young to remember the night his home
in the village of Jama'een near Nablus was attacked by a mob of Israeli
settlers. His father remembers, however, because he lost two sons. &quot;It
was the start of the Intifadah and there was great tension between the Arabs
and the Jews. We live across from the Ariel settlement and our home is on
the edge of the village near the main road. There must have been some kind
of incident, because they were looking for any Arabs to attack. They attacked
my home and burned two of my sons to death. Amar was lucky to live.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amar may be lucky to be alive, but he was left with horrible
scars for the rest of his life. For six years Amar was left untreated, as
there are no quality burn centres in Palestine. Once the Israeli hospital
stabilized the boy, he was sent to a Palestinian hospital. He was not given
great care there and returned home to heal his horrible scars. Amar may
be lucky to be alive, but he lost his eyelids and could not close his eyes
to sleep at night. He also developed contractures at both elbows preventing
him from extending his arms; he lost two fingers on his left hand and a
damaged thumb on his right hand; he lost both of his ears, severely burned
his scalp and a received a terrible burn on his neck where his skin was
attached from his mouth to his chest and from his shoulder to his ear. The
boy's appearance was so disfigured that other kids in the village made fun
of him. Women screamed when they saw him. He did not go to school. Instead,
his grandmother taught him in the home, away from the stares and name-calling.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This is a classic example of what happens to a burn
victim when they are left untreated,&quot; says Dr. Michael Peters, a plastic
surgeon in San Diego. &quot;He should have been managed from day one where
the skin would not have contracted and left him with such horrible scar
tissue.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last year, Dr. Peters was approached by the Palestine Children's
Relief Fund to help treat Amar. The P.C.R.F. had received notice of Amar's
case from Dr. Riyad El-Zannoun, the Palestinian Health Minister in Gaza,
who saw that no physician in Palestine could provide Amar with the reconstructive
plastic surgery that he so badly needed. The P.C.R.F. began seeking free
treatment for Amar in an area where the Arab community has shown great support.
&quot;We could not arrange treatment for Amar in an area where we don't
have great community support,&quot; explains the P.C.R.F. social worker
Huda Al-Masri. &quot;Amar's case is a special case. You need to ensure that
whoever houses him is able to overcome his physical appearance and able
to deal with Amar as a suffering child. We have such people in San Diego.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fortunately, the P.C.R.F. has a strong Arab community in
San Diego who have been active in helping send injured Arab kids to other
areas of the U.S. for treatment. The P.C.R.F. chapter there expressed a
willingness to help with Amar's case. &quot;I showed my children Amar's
photos at first and prepared them for his arrival,&quot; explains Gabrielle
Tayem, who, along with her husband Mohammed, is one of the two host families
caring for Amar in San Diego. &quot;It took some time, but when he arrived,
everything worked out.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, Tareq Tayem, Gabrielle's 10-year-old son, and Khaldoon
Khaireddin, 11, who is the son of Marwan and Hiam Khaireddin, the other
host family for Amar, quickly befriended the burned boy. &quot;I don't have
any friends in Palestine,&quot; Amar told a reporter who saw him the first
day. &quot;Kids just call me names.&quot; He loves America because here
he has friends, he says. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 17 February, the Arab community in San Diego, led by
the P.C.R.F. chapter, organized a reception for Amar and for his doctors
and others who have helped the non-profit organization treat other kids
like him for the past 5 years. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 21 February, Amar was admitted to Mercy Hospital in
San Diego and had a six-hour operation under the care of Dr. Michael Peters
and Dr. Doug Arbon, an anesthesiologist. Both doctors treated Amar for free.
Mercy Hospital provided him the room for free as well. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The P.C.R.F. is the only organization that is arranging
for free medical care in the U.S. for injured Arab children who cannot be
treated in their homeland,&quot; explains Sue Nasir, the P.C.R.F. Vice-president
in Los Angeles. &quot;In addition to Amar, we have here Rim Zaim, a beautiful
little girl from Syria who we have arranged for free treatment at the Shriners
Hospital in L.A. We are also bringing children from Lebanon and Jordan who
need medical care they cannot get at home. We arrange for them for free
here.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amar's case was published in American newspapers in San
Diego and later the main television stations came and did nightly stories
on the brave boy with his host families and doctors. &quot;Every night each
station would do something on Amar. It was an incredible event because as
Arabs, we are not used to getting such overwhelming positive exposure like
that,&quot; says Hiam Khaireddin, who began the P.C.R.F. chapter in San
Diego. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American community in San Diego began to respond to
Amar's case by calling the hospital to wish him well and send him flowers.
Tareq Tayem's classmates all sent him get-well cards. The P.C.R.F. chapter
there arranged for the boy to have Arab-speaking members of the community
that take turns sitting with him in the hospital. It is this type of activity
that sets San Diego's Arab community apart from the others. It is not just
giving money, but being an active part in a humanitarian project that helps
suffering children.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amar himself is an exceptional boy. Despite his pain and
suffering over the years, he is not ashamed of his appearance and is so
happy to have new friends and families who love him and are treating him
like their own. He went into his surgery without any fear. All he wants
is to get better and to have a chance at a new life. Thanks to the P.C.R.F.,
the Arab community, Mercy Hospital and Dr. Peters and Dr. Arbon, Amar is
realizing this dream. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But Amar is not the only boy in need of care unavailable
at home. The P.C.R.F. has dozens more Palestinian, Lebanese and Syrian children
in need of medical care that is not available to them at home. The P.C.R.F.
arranges that care for free, but needs help with plane tickets, housing
and other social help from the Arab community in the U.S. Let the hard work
and great success of the San Diego community be a model for others to follow.

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Islamic Waqf protests Israeli confiscation
of Palestinian House in Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- The head
of the Islamic Waqf (Endowments) office in the Occupied Jerusalem assailed
the Israeli occupation authorities for confiscating a Palestinian house
in the Old City following the 20 November murder of a Jewish settler in
the Old City of Occupied Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Mr. Adnan Husseini said the Israeli government is using
security as a pretext to reinforce Jewish settlement in Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This measure will be counterproductive, because it
will encourage the settlers to new provocations,&quot; said Mr. Husseini.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli police have seized the house near the place where
the settler was killed and set up a guard post on the roof.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settler activist who was killed, Gabriel Hirshberg,
26, was a student at a religious school run by the rightist terrorist group
Ateret Cohanim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian-owned home was confiscated by Israel &quot;for
security reasons&quot; in 1969. It was taken over by Ateret Cohanim students
who live in a neighbouring house in 1991.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the settlers were forced to evacuate the house in 1994
following legal action by its Palestinian owners. It has remained empty
since then because the court asked the owners to rent it to Ateret Cohanim,
a request they rejected.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel illegally occupied Arab east Jerusalem in 1967 and
has moved in around 160,000 Jewish settlers.</FONT></P>

Lawyer</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Jews' holiest
place, the Wailing Wall, does not legally belong to the Jewish state, an
Israeli lawyer and expert on Jerusalem's holy sites said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Shmuel Berkovits said in a research paper published by
the Jerusalem Institute for Israel Studies that the wall is legally owned
by the Islamic Waqf Authority, custodian of Muslim shrines overlooking the
wall in the Occupied Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In June 1967, Israel illegally occupied East Jerusalem
and confiscated the area around the wall to be used by the Jewish worshippers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;But the government decided not to expropriate the
wall itself so as not to revive the battle over the rights to the wall,&quot;
said Berkovits.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the Israeli government also feared that the
confiscation of the wall would be seen as relinquishing its claim to the
nearby Al Aqsa Shrine, known by the Jews as Temple Mount.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sheikh Ekrima Sabri, the Mufti of Jerusalem, said the wall
was part of the Al Aqsa Shrine. &quot;We don't recognise whether Israel
confiscated it or not and it does not change the reality,&quot; he said
adding that any Islamic Waqf remains so until doomsday.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli army closes off Mosque to Muslims;
kills youth</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- PT</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops shot and killed a Palestinian
Christian on 22 November at an Israeli military roadblock just outside Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said Israeli &quot;Border Police&quot;
soldiers opened fire with automatic rifles at a car driven by Subhi Michael
Kanawati at the Israeli military roadblock just north of Bethlehem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kanawati, the son of a prominent Christian-Arab clan, was
killed instantly, as Israeli bullets penetrated the back of his head.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Family sources in Bethlehem said Kanawati was carrying
bread supplies to nearby grocery stores when his car came under a hail of
bullets from the Israeli garrison guarding the roadblock.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kanawati carried a Salvadorian passport, like many Palestinian
Christian-Arabs who seek foreign passports as a means to ward off Israeli
persecution and harassment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli army spokesman said in a statement that Kanawati
&quot;may have tried to run over an Israeli soldier manning the roadblock.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement said &quot;soldiers opened fire at the vehicles'
tires, but one random bullet hit Kanawati in the head.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The statement ended with the routine phrase &quot;the incident
is being investigated.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the fatal shooting of Kanawati, clashes between
stone-throwing Palestinians, many of whom are schoolchildren, and heavily
armed Israeli soldiers erupted in the vicinity of Bilal Ibn Rabah Mosque
(which Jews call Rachel's Tomb).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israelis used rubber bullets (actually metal bullets
with thin rubber coverings), and tear-gas to quell Palestinian demonstrations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to eyewitnesses, several schoolchildren suffered
suffocation from gas-inhalation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In an unrelated development, a Palestinian youth died in
vague circumstances in the village of Rafat near Kalkilya when an explosion
ripped off his room on 21 November.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Local sources identified the man as Badran Awadh Abu Asbeh,
25, who is a teacher and a graduate student at the Najah National University.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not clear yet what caused the explosion, but locals
surmise it was either an Israeli-executed assassination or an accidental
detonation of an explosive device he was preparing.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the explosion, Israeli troops cordoned off the
village and cut it off from the outside world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Islamist sources pointed out that it was &quot;highly likely
that the Israeli intelligence was behind the incident.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If true, this would portend the beginning of a new round
of bloody violence between Hamas and Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In another development, the occupation authorities closed
off the Ibrahimi mosque in Hebron to Muslim worshippers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The closure of the Mosque to Muslims by the Israeli occupation
authorities has assumed an increasingly recurrent pace, which raises serious
questions about Israeli intentions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 21 November, hundreds of Jewish settlers converged on
Hebron to celebrate a Jewish holiday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Arab sources, many of the settlers chanted
anti-Arab and anti-Muslim slogans, and some of them attacked Arab property
in the Hebron Old Town.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are as many as 200 troublesome and fanatic settlers
living under round-the-clock military protection in the heart of Hebron
in the midst of 170,000 Palestinians. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians say that very often, townspeople are held
hostage to the whims and &quot;security&quot; of the settlers, and are denied
freedom of movement within the city. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 12 November, Solidarity International for Human Rights
said the Nafha desert jail Israeli authorities sprayed the Palestinian detainees
with gas before assaulting them. A statement by the human rights organization
said the detainees were attacked by gas while they were protesting against
the electricity and water failure in the jail and against the suspension
of their usual hour-long break. Several prisoners fainted and lost consciousness,
the statement added. Some prisoners suffered fractures in different parts
of their bodies. More than 640 Palestinians are detained in Nafha jail south
of occupied Palestine. Solidarity International expressed concern over the
conditions of the Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli jails because of
the inhumane treatment they receive, which contradicts the international
laws and conventions.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus, (Quds Press)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Amnesty
International expressed concern for the life of Ashraf Nasrallah, a Palestinian
prisoner, who has been tortured by Israeli interrogators in Ashkelon jail
since the beginning of November. A report issued by Amnesty said Nasrallah
was forced to sit on a small chair 30 centimetres tall for long periods
while his hands and legs were tied to the chair while a sack covered his
head. He was also forced to listen to loud music. The combination of these
torture techniques has resulted in the deterioration of his health. Ashraf's
lawyer said he submitted several petitions to the Israeli Supreme Court
to order the Israeli internal security service, Shin Bet, to stop using
violence against his client under interrogation. But the petitions were
rejected every time because the Israeli prosecutor produced assertions that
he did not allow interrogators to use violence.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>behind the increase of university tuition</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>London (Quds Press):</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The Palestinian
Minister of Higher Education, Dr. Hanan Ashrawi, attributed the increase
of tuition at the Palestinian universities to the Israeli closure, which,
she said, created hard economic circumstances for the Palestinian Authority,
and to the reduction of European contributions. Dr. Ashrawi told the BBC
that the continuous Israeli closures imposed on the Palestinian territories
and the difficult economic circumstances of the Palestinian people caused
a sharp reduction in their incomes. She added that the university students
pay only 25%-30% of the total costs of their education. The Palestinian
Minister pointed out that the European Union's assistance to the Palestinian
universities has been reduced from 15 million ECU (European currency units)
to 8 million ECU over the past three years and is expected to be reduced
to only 4 million ECU by next year. Students and employees of the Palestinian
universities staged strikes protesting the tuition increase of 1 Jordanian
dinar (JD) per credit hour for the senior students and of JD 3 per credit
hour for the freshman students, while the employees protested their not
receiving their salaries for a long period.</FONT></P>
