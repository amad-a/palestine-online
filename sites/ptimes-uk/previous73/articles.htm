<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Corruption Prevails in PA Institutions</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A few weeks after the Israeli &quot;Haartz&quot; newspaper
revealed the fact that Chairman Yasser Arafat had secret accounts in some
Israeli banks in Tel Aviv, reports on corruption in Palestinian Authority
ministries and institutions began to be publicly announced. The Israeli
newspaper mentioned an amount of $150 million in these accounts, while other
sources emphasized that the figures were larger. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These funds are not under the control of the PA's Ministry
of Finance and many PA officials were kept in the dark about the secret
accounts. More corruption was revealed in the annual report of the PA's
Control Board. The report spoke about serious financial and administrative
violations by most of the PA's ministries and establishments. The report
estimated losses of up to $326 million as a result of those violations.
The report accused a number of Palestinian ministers, under-secretaries
and director-generals of misappropriation of funds and rejecting reports
by the Control Board which frequently requested them to stop wasting public
money and to be more cautious in spending. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the Palestinian officials went on opening private accounts
in banks without notifying the finance ministry. They were also charged
with receiving foreign contributions and not including them in their ministries'
budgets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the past year, the Control Board prepared 634 reports,
and 50 studies. It received 205 complaints against the PA's ministries and
officials concerning financial and administration violations.. The final
report which was submitted to the Legislative Council in June consisted
of 600 pages covering 22 ministries, 295 establishments and 435 municipalities.
But surprisingly, the report did not cover the financial and administrative
violations committed by the Legislative Council and the security and military
services which the Board claimed were out of its control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One of the most important violations revealed in the report
was the large amount of money the PA's ministries and establishments spent
on telephone calls. A telephone bill submitted by one of the Palestinian
senior officials amounted to $6,500 in one month. Most of the calls made
by that official had nothing to do with his official work. They were purely
personal calls. The report said more than 5,000 mobile telephones were distributed
to PA officials noting that the costs of calls made through these phones
are very expensive compared to ordinary phones.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Public money was also wasted on cars and fuel used by PA
officials. The cars are usually given to ministers and under-secretaries
but in many cases they were given to junior officials as well. Some ministers
were given more than one car each. Dr. Nabil Shaath, Minister of Planning
and International Cooperation, and Jamil Tarifi, Minister of Civil Affairs,
for example, were given four cars each.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report pointed out that the rentals of some ministry
buildings are more expensive than the already bought buildings. Dr. Shaath's
ministry, for example, pays $440,000 a year in rent for its different buildings
although only 300 employees are working in that ministry. Dr. Sa'adi Kuronz,
head of the financial committee at the Legislative Council said in a press
conference that the amount of money spent on rentals for buildings used
by ministries forms 36.5% of the total operational costs. He added that
four years' worth of rents for these buildings would be enough to build
permanent complexes for the PA's ministries and establishments.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Kuronz pointed out that no restrictions are imposed
by the PA on the usage of mobile telephones by Palestinian officials. But
he said his committee recommended every ministry to use 3 telephones only
one each for the minister, under-secretary, and the director-general. It
also recommended that each telephone bill should not exceed $150 per month.
In certain cases, the PA paid the bills of the private telephones of the
ministers and senior officials, Dr. Kuronz said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Despite the decision made by the Legislative Council which
prohibited the ministries from publishing advertisements of a social nature,
such as congratulations or condolences, the ministries paid no heed to this
decision and continued to waste money on such advertisements, the Palestinian
official said. One ministry, for instance, published 30 of these advertisements
in one month which cost about $4,500, Dr. Kuronz said.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>No Internal Structure in Ministries</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There is no internal organizational structure in all the
PA's ministries. Therefore most of the new recruitments are not made in
accordance with the actual needs of every ministry or establishment. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Figures in the report show that the number of director-generals
employed in the PA's civil service bodies (1,200 director-generals in 25
ministries!) are more than the number in the United States. These officials
are appointed regardless of their poor qualifications or of the actual needs
of the ministry. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In one ministry, for example, there were between 50 and
60 director-generals. Most of them were appointed because of favouritism
and/or their blood kinship with ministers and senior officials.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Monopolies</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The famous article by David Hirst published in the &quot;Guardian&quot;
on 21 April entitled &quot;Shameless in Gaza&quot; and the extensive report
published in the Israeli &quot;Haartz&quot; newspaper on 4 April entitled
&quot;The Man Who Swallowed Gaza&quot; shed light on the spread of corruption
throughout the various bodies of the self-rule authority. David Hirst talked
of the misappropriation of funds by a number of PA officials such as Mahmoud
Abbas and Abu Mazen, who signed the Oslo Accords for the PLO. According
to Hirst, Abu Mazen built a villa in Gaza which cost $2 million! One wonders
where did this man, who spent the last 32 years of his life as a PLO freedom
fighter, get the money from! The answer, written plainly on the villa's
wall by a Palestinian boy, reads &quot;This is your reward for selling Palestine.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Nabil Shaath has a number of monopolies and enjoys
good relations with the Israelis. When Dr. Shaath got married last year,
he held four reception parties: one in Cairo, another in Gaza and two in
Jerusalem- one of them specifically for his Israeli friends.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli newspaper revealed that the secret accounts
in the Israeli banks are run by Arafat's economic adviser, Khalid Salam,
who is considered one of the PA's most prominent men. He also controls several
monopolies, namely the Bahar (Sea), which monopolizes the PA's imports and
exports. The Gazans, as David Hirst says, make fun of the name describing
it as &quot;ocean&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Budgets of Security Bodies and Arafat's
Office</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was no reason for the Control Board's report not
mentioning the public funds spent by Chairman Arafat's office and the various
security and military bodies. Reliable Palestinian sources estimated the
annual expenditure of Arafat's office at more than $80 million and that
of the security bodies at $248 million.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>To avoid angry reactions from the Palestinian street, Chairman
Arafat set up a committee to investigate the violations listed in the Control
Board's report. Besides that, the only other action taken by Arafat was
his decision to appoint a new director-general for the Income Tax Authority.
He also transferred two directors from the same Authority to other establishments.
The PA Chairman also signed a decision changing the Bahar company into a
government one! But these actions did not, by any means, affect the Palestinian
senior officials who are directly involved in the financial misappropriation.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hebron May Set Pace for a New Intifada</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Khalil (Hebron)- Intermittent clashes between Palestinian
demonstrators and Israeli occupation soldiers in down-town Hebron continued
unabatedly last month. The clashes, which started on 13 June, generally
assumed a monotonous pattern whereby Palestinian youngsters would hurl stones
toward rather than at or on Israeli soldiers taking positions along the
&quot;partitioning line,&quot; with the latter responding rather harshly
with &quot;rubber bullets&quot; containing a lethal iron nucleus, tear gas,
stun grenades, and eventually live ammunition. According to hospital sources
in Hebron, around 150 mostly teenaged protesters sustained gun-shot wounds.
At least 10 people were reportedly in critical condition, including a 12-year-old,
Murad Jamjum, whose head was hit by an Israeli sniper bullet causing his
brain to hemorrhage, and a 13-year-old, Lina Rashid Misk, who sustained
a serious wound in the belly, forcing doctors to sever 40 centimetres of
her damaged intestines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian medical sources said many of the inflicted
injuries were meant to kill or cause irreversible damage, e.g. paralysis
or permanent disability. &quot;We have seen many of the injured were hit
by bullets in the upper part of their bodies, particularly the head, the
chest, and the spinal cord,&quot; said Yousef al Sharawi, Chief Physician
at the Amira Alya hospital in Hebron. Sharawi dismissed Israeli allegations
that rubber bullets don't kill as &quot;rubbish talk.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;These bullets are quite lethal as they can pierce
into the body several inches often causing irreparable damage.&quot; Al
Sharawi cited a case of a 75-year-old man from Halhul who was seriously
wounded in the latest clashes and remained in critical condition at al Ahli
hospital. He said a rubber bullet penetrated the elderly man's head, destroying
some of the vital blood vessels. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Deep Frustration</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian protests in Hebron were ostensibly fuelled
by U.S. House of Representatives' decision to recognize Jerusalem as &quot;Israel's
united and undivided capital.&quot; Indeed, the American decision drew indignant
reactions from most Palestinians and was viewed as another proof, if proof
was needed, of flagrant American hostility to Arab and Muslim causes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nevertheless, the underlying reason behind the current
wave of unrest seems to have more to do with the dying or already-dead peace
process than with the American decision. Observers note that most Palestinians
have come to feel cheated and betrayed by a peace process that further narrowed
their horizons and made them ever more vulnerable to Israeli insolence and
hegemony. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Manifestations of the Palestinians' collective ordeal are
everywhere. Settlements are spreading out in all directions, closing in
on Palestinian towns, villages and hamlets, turning them into &quot;shut-in
ghettos&quot; deprived of any prospects of future growth or demographic
expansion. The Judaization of Jerusalem, meanwhile, is continuing on a frenzied
pace, and concerted efforts are being made to achieve demographic &quot;Jewish&quot;
continuity between the Holy City and Jericho, thus cutting the West Bank
into two halves.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority seems
to be completely naked, powerless, and demoralized. To illustrate its dismal
state of affairs, some PA officials are beginning to speak of reverting
to the previous status quo, a return to the direct Israeli occupation of
Palestinian towns now under exclusive PA control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One week before this report, a leading Fateh leader in
the West Bank, Abbas Zaki, recognized that &quot;the boat could be rocked
altogether in the occupied territories.&quot; Speaking at the PA Ministry
of Information office in Hebron on 19 June, Zaki pointed out that the Palestinian
people are increasingly fed up with the peace process and with what he called
the PA's &quot;futile treatment of the current crisis.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This situation can't be sustained for much longer.
Either we advance forward or return to confrontation, and should we be forced
to revert to violence, it wouldn't be confined to us; there would be a regional
conflagration with unpredictable ramifications.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Anger in Nablus</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Zaki's predictions do not seem to be far-fetched. On 21
June, as many as 10,000 townspeople took to the streets to protest the House
of Representatives decision on Jerusalem and America's sinister alliance
with the Zionist entity. The huge mass of humanity shouted in unison &quot;with
soul and blood, we shall protect Jerusalem&quot; and &quot;we are willing
to die so that Jerusalem may live.&quot; The rally, the first joint Islamist-Nationalist
endeavour of its kind, was addressed by several speakers representing Hamas,
the PA, Fateh and leftist groups. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>PA Corruption: The Other Side of Patriotism</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By M. Sadiq</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The city of Al-Khalil (Hebron) is once again raging. Its
stone-armed youths take to the streets every day from dawn to dusk. Their
daily mission is to engage the Israeli troops that have been, by virtue
of the Hebron agreement between the Palestinian Authority (PA) and Israel,
deployed in the heart of the city to protect several hundred Zionist Jews
whose illegal occupation of the old quarters was legitimized by the said
agreement. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Khalilis (citizens of Al-Khalil) feel more than anybody
else in the 1967 occupied Palestinian territory the betrayal of their National
Authority. Elsewhere in the West Bank, and especially in East Jerusalem
which is shrinking day after day, the situation resembles a boiling volcano
that is likely to erupt at any time. Few people remain who have not yet
been disillusioned with the so-called peace process. Very few of them still
imagine that one day Palestinians and Israelis will live side by side in
harmony and peace. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At the same time, the Palestinian community in the Gaza
Strip and the West Bank is much more acquainted with the nature of the PA
and its officials -- a Mafia that neither belongs to the people nor cares
for them. All its members are interested in is to seize this golden opportunity,
that is of having been contracted by the Israelis to shield them from martyrdom-loving
fanatics, so as to increase their wealth and fulfil their lustful desires.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So much has been said and written about the corruption
of the PA and about its human rights violations that PA leader Yasser Arafat
has been sending emissaries to explain that Israelis fabricate these stories,
or at least exaggerate them, in order to pressure him to concede more to
them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Such an argument, recently defended through Saudi-owned
media in London (Al-Hayat newspaper and MBC television), an Arafat envoy,
is not convincing for those who know well that not much is left to concede.
Umm Jihad (Intisar Al-Wazir), PA minister of social affairs -- who visited
London between 16 and 21 June, defended her administration by claiming that
hostile circles and foreign media have been deliberately exaggerating isolated
cases of corruption and violations of human rights, which in her opinion
exist normally in any administration. A recent live debate on the Qatari
Al-Jazeera satellite TV between Arafat's spokesperson Nabil Amr and Hamas
Political Bureau member Muhammad Nazzal in the beginning of June has uncovered
a deep crisis within the ranks of the PA over its image and the failure
of its PR operation. It is rumoured that Amr was chastised by Arafat and
condemned by other PA officials for having lost the debate.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, the real dilemma for the PA is what to do about
its image, not as a corrupt or oppressive administration -- for in this
it is not unique in the Arab region -- but about collapse, seemingly beyond
redemption, of its peace treaty with Israel. PA official may get away with
corruption, at least for a while, and may be able to defend their appalling
record of human rights, but they have no excuse, or let us say explanation,
for the continuing expropriation of land and expansion of Jewish settlements
by Israel. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a face-saving ploy, the PA reportedly has been embroiled
in the liquidation of alleged Palestinian land brokers suspected of selling
Arab land to Israelis. The ex-judicial killings have been condemned by Israel
and the United States of America, clearly not out of sympathy with the victims
or in support of the rule of law, but as unequivocally stated by officials
from both sides because the PA has no right to forbid the selling of Arab
land to Jews. The U.S. Congress has gone as far as considering the ban anti-Semitic.
Among the Palestinians who under normal circumstances would welcome the
punishment of traitors of all sorts -- informers, land sellers and brokers
-- the response to the ex-judicial killings has been one of skepticism.
People ask: &quot;If a person deserves to be executed for selling a piece
or more of land, what about those who have sold the entire country?&quot;
This is in reference to the peace deal which recognizes Israel as a legitimate
state, and thus concedes more than 90% of the Palestinian territory. Some
joke: &quot;The executed brokers incurred the punishment not because selling
the land is a crime, but because they undertook to do what happens to be
the sole prerogative of Yasser Arafat and his men. No one has the right
to sell land or concede Palestinian rights except the 'sole legitimate representative
of the Palestinian people'.&quot; But more serious critics explain that
the PA had to do something to show to the people that it is opposed to the
Israeli expansion of settlements. Naturally it could not stop the Israelis;
it neither had the jurisdiction nor the power. According to the Oslo agreement,
the PA's sole jurisdiction is over the Palestinian population. It has no
jurisdiction over the land, not even over what grows on it or what exists
within it. So, from the point of view of the Israelis, what they do is perfectly
legal and legitimate. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>By executing a number of alleged land brokers, the PA has
hoped to restore its patriotic image at a time when the public has had nothing
to talk about except the scandals of PA senior officials, some of whom have
been associated with rape, drugs, lavish lifestyles, and the spread of pubs
and nightclubs along Gaza beach. This is, of course, not to mention the
disclosure in Israel, as a result of a parliamentary investigation, the
hundreds of millions of dollars deposited in a Tel Aviv bank account belonging
to Yasser Arafat, and the numerous stories told in the Palestinian street
about the extravagance of his wife, who allegedly prefers to do her shopping
in Paris. Interestingly, the chief editor of the London-based Al-Hayat in
his daily column rallied to the help of the Arafat &quot;dynasty&quot; by
stressing that Suha Arafat is the poorest wife of an Arab president. She
might well be the poorest among them, but that does not in any way mean
she does not already sit on a huge fortune, much of which it is alleged
came from the 5% deducted from the salaries of Palestinians working in the
Gulf to support the struggle for the liberation of their country as well
as from the millions of dollars donated by Gulf governments to the PLO.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Last Call For Jerusalem</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lately, we have seen the reality and the truth of America's
stance on Israel as it has unfolded its rosy petals to show us the ugly,
dark truth. We see that the American government does not care to come into
the light and let the world see its &quot;blood&quot; relation to Israel---
their parent-child relationship. They are so confident in their power that
they believe no one can stop what has been put into play. One day, their
arrogance may be their downfall. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>America has boldly announced its movement of the American
embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem. This shows us that America no longer
sees Jerusalem as an international city for Muslims, Christians and Jews,
but now it recognizes it as the sole capital of Israel. What will happen
to the Arabs living there? People who were born in Jerusalem are already
being kicked out. Imagine how freely the Israelis will behave with Americans
nearby to protect them. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American government stated that it would spend 100
million dollars to build their new embassy. Why is so much American tax
dollars going to be wasted? Are they planning to build in half of the city,
or do they think they will need to pay for large numbers of troops and weapons
to protect themselves and the Israelis? </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The American government has been an indirect enemy to the
Palestinian people for years as they have sent 10 billion dollars a year
in foreign aid and weapons to Israel as well as their undying support. Now
their presence in a sacred city--- sacred to all Muslims and Christians---
will show an open change in their policy. They will become the direct enemy
to the Palestinians. The American government never asked its people if they
wanted to get involved in a war or to waste their tax money in this region.
If the American embassy moves to Jerusalem, it cannot bring peace; all I
see is a future of war. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How can this be reversed? How can we try to halt, or at
least delay, their construction? The only solution I see is to &quot;fight
fire with fire&quot; by fighting them in the territory that they know. We
must meet them on the Congressional ground. The Israelis found this out
long ago. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli lobby is the largest and most powerful lobby
in the US, and it has influenced many governmental decisions. There are
enough Muslims (between 6 to 10 million), Arab-Americans and other interested
parties who could make such a stance if they would unite and mobilize as
the Israeli lobby does. All that the Congressmen understand is power, money
and position. I recommend that anyone who wants to see lobbying methods,
to take some examples, should read the ex-Congressman Paul Findley's book
They Dare to Speak Out. However, some of the methods used by the Israeli
lobby, we would not want to stoop so low to use. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We should make sure the supporters of Jerusalem and the
Palestinians are registered to vote. Then, petitions and letters could be
mailed and phone calls could be made to US Congressmen. Also, rallies and
demonstrations could be held. We must try this method. If it fails, then
we must remember Jamal Abdul-Nasser's words &quot;What is taken by force,
must be returned by force.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians Castigate Congress Decision</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The recent
decision by the U.S. Congress to recognize Jerusalem as &quot;Israel's united
and undivided capital&quot; has drawn indignant reactions from Palestinians
at all levels in the occupied territories and in pre-1967 Palestine. On
Friday, 13 June, the Juma'a speaker at al Masjidul Aqsa (Aqsa Mosque) launched
a vitriolic attack at the decision by Congress describing it as &quot;provocative,
obscene and diabolical.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This sinister decision is new proof, if proof is
needed, of the contempt with which the United States treats the Arab-Muslim
world, masses and regimes,&quot; said the speaker. However, he blamed Arab
and Muslim leaders and peoples for giving &quot;this Satanic force&quot;
sufficient reason &quot;to treat us lightly and not to take us seriously.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We have only ourselves to blame because we willingly
accepted to be subservient to the Americans in ways resembling the subservience
of the tail to the body,&quot; said the speaker, alluding to the close ties
between the United States and many Arab regimes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Hebron, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub argued that al Quds (Jerusalem)
represents the heart of the Muslim Umma (nation) &quot;and its conscience,
its dignity, present and future&quot;, adding that &quot;should the Umma,
God forbid, continue to allow Israel to retain Jerusalem, then death would
be better than life for Muslims.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub, an eloquent and quotable preacher in the Hebron
area, pointed out, however, that the United States wouldn't have dared embarked
on such &quot;insult to the Muslim world,&quot; had it not been for Arab
subservience to the White House. Rajoub turned on the Palestinian Authority,
saying that it is time this &quot;absurd show of the peace process is terminated.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Haven't you realized by now that the peace process
is a sheer illusion and the so-called sole sponsor of the process is a viscious
enemy of Muslims,&quot; Rajoub said before several thousand worshippers.
For its part, the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas, strongly condemned
the decision by Congress saying it represented a new provocation against
Muslims the world over. Moreover, the Islamist Movement warned American
decision makers that Muslims would not keep silent indefinitely in the face
of American insolence and hegemony. &quot;Jerusalem, East and West, and
the whole of Palestine is Muslim. The American decision is therefore null
and void as far as Muslims are concerned.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Condemnation of the Congress decision also came from Muslim
leaders in Israel. Sheikh Raed Salah, Mayor of Um Al Fahem, sent a telegram
to the U.S. Ambassador to Israel, Martin Endyk, expressing total rejection
of the decision. Sheikh Salah described the decision as one amounting to
&quot;a declaration of war against the Muslim Umma.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Congress decision on Jerusalem coincided with the near
collapse of the peace process and with determined Israeli efforts to impose
the fait accompli on the Palestinian Authority. Hence, it would be reasonably
safe to expect tense and potentially violent days and weeks ahead.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>PT interviews the leader of the Islamic Action Front
in Jordan </FONT></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Al-Farhan: Public freedoms in Jordan in decline
</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman - By Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leader of the Islamic Action Front (IAF) in Jordan
Dr. Isaaq Al-Farhan expressed his party's views on how democracy can be
improved and why political parties in general should play a more vital role
in the formation of the ideal democratic society. The interview with the
Islamic leader went as follows:</FONT></P>

<P>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you assess the position of your party on the
Jordanian political map?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The Islamic Action Front
(IAF) is a party that was established in 1992 following the resumption of
democratic life in Jordan in 1989. The IAF is different than other political
parties in Jordan because it's creation depended upon the achievements of
the Islamic Movement over the last five decades. Therefore, it is considered
an extension of the Islamic Movement and of the Muslim Brotherhood (MB)
in particular. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The majority of the IAF members are from the Muslim Brotherhood.
IAF is the only political Islamic party working in Jordan and it is open
to all Muslims who are free to join without restrictions. This is different
than the leftist and the national political parties which are numerous in
Jordan. In addition, IAF is the largest party in Jordan and has the largest
number of representatives in the Lower House of Parliament. There are 15
deputies in Parliament. Our deputies also made up about one quarter of the
Parliament in the 1989 elections. The party leads the 11 opposition parties
in Jordan and its secretary-general is the secretary-general of the Popular
Conference for the Protection of Homeland and Anti-Normalization (the normalization
of ties with Israel), which includes more than 1,000 Jordanian political
and public figures.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you assess the situation of democracy, the
public and individual freedoms in Jordan?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> In order not to be misunderstood,
we want democracy in its technical term which means the people's participation
in vital issues that affect their lives. However, the Western democratic
system, as understood by us, contains many gaps and negative aspects. We
take from democracy what goes in line with the Islamic Shura (consultative)
values. Democracy in Jordan is not in an ideal condition but there are some
forms of democracy. Therefore, we were keen on enhancing the democratic
conduct in the country. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The democratic aspects that exist in Jordan are far from
the ideal democratic system. The conduct of the consequent governments and
their different institutions are still martial. The Interior Ministry, for
example, examines the lists of people who pay contributions to the political
parties which puts the public in a state of fear and makes them refrain
from assisting the parties. Many members of these parties have been denied
access to public jobs, scholarships and facilities that the government usually
provides for ordinary people. The government's suspicious and negative view
of the parties keeps the general public away from these parties. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, the prime ministers have not put the leaders
of the Jordanian parties in the political picture. In ordinary democracies,
if an important or serious event occurred, the prime minister would call
the leaders of the pro-government or the opposition parties for a meeting
to inform them of the developments in order that the parties' policies and
attitudes towards these developments would be based on facts and not affected
by rumours. If government wants to enhance democracy, it should consider
the parties as national institutions and should meet with the parties' leaders
regularly. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>We also felt that the government has deformed the picture
of democracy. Democracy is based on different institutions such as the parliament,
political parties, media and the professional syndicates. The government
began marginalizing the role of the political parties and the parliament
by issuing temporary laws without being passed by the parliament. For instance,
it issued the new elections law, &quot;One man, one vote&quot;, which has
no equal to it anywhere in the world. In other countries that adopt similar
laws, each constituency is represented in the parliament by one member.
However, in Jordan, it is represented by two, three or more members and
the elector is allowed to elect only one candidate. This means that each
elector is given a one-half vote, one-third or one-quarter and so on. This
system violates the Constitution and we insist that the &quot;One man, one
vote&quot; law is unconstitutional. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, the government surprised us with issuing the recent
temporary law of press and censorship which abuses the freedom of press
and expression. This law imposes unacceptable fines on any journalist convicted
by the court. The fine reaches 15,000 Jordanian dinars (JD) (about $20,000),
which translates into approximately the total amount of his earnings during
his career life! The government can wait until the parliamentary session
is convened to study and vote on these laws. The issuing of such temporary
laws by the government is an abuse of democracy. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In short, I have concerns over the democratic situation
in Jordan. It is unsatisfactory. Yes, there is a margin of democracy, but
it is narrowing. The level of public and individual freedoms is declining.
Unless the government reconsiders its attitude towards this issue, I am
afraid the course of democracy will continue to collapse.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. You personally participated in previous governments
in the 1970s, and a number of Muslim Brothers participated in a former Jordanian
government. What did you achieve from such participation?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I do not understand the
concept of a political party not participating in the executive or legislative
authorities. From my personal experience in the government, except for the
big decisions concerning the future of the country, any minister can undertake
big authorities inside his ministry. My participation in three or four previous
cabinets as minister of Awqaf and later as minister of education was positive
and constructive regarding the development of the cadres and programmes
of the two ministries. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When I was minister of Awqaf and Islamic Affairs, we took
the initiative to organize &quot;preaching camps&quot; in different areas
of Jordan. The preachers were asked to tour and visit people in their residences
and farms. The governor of al Karak, south of Jordan, told me that the rates
of crime in that area were reduced after the regular visits of the preachers.
The minister can play an effective role in developing his ministry and serving
his people, especially if he has a programme to carry out. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As for the experience of the five Islamist ministers who
joined Mr. Mudar Badran's cabinet in 1991, it is difficult to evaluate their
participation because they were in office for only five months including
three months during the Gulf War. But our participation in both the government
and the parliament led, in general, to many significant achievements at
the time. We succeeded, for instance, to cancel Martial Law and to re-appoint
all public servants who were dismissed from their jobs for political reasons
during the Martial period. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I remember that Dr. Abdulla Akaila (deputy for IAF), who
was the education minister in 1991, issued a decision on his first day in
the ministry returning all teachers and ministry's employees who were dismissed
for their political affiliation in the 1970s and the 1980s. There were thousands
and some of them were communists or belonged to the Baath Party. Our minister
of Social Development, Mr. Yousef Al Azem, had also approved a decision
to establish 20 charitable organizations which were forbidden, for security
reasons, from being developed. We also persisted and succeeded to return
more than 20,000 passports to their owners after being confiscated by the
government during the Martial phase. Therefore, all political parties should
take part in the government. </FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Do you have any restrictions on participation in
the government?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> There are certain restrictions
regarding our participation. We did not participate in the governments that
were involved in peace talks with Israel or those which signed the peace
agreements with Israel. We shall continue our opposition to the peace treaty.
Even if we participate in any future government, we shall maintain this
opposing attitude. It is wise for the regime to call for the Islamists to
form a government that does not abandon its principles and that can cease
the normalization of ties with Israel in the light of the stalemate of the
peace process. (Israeli Prime Minister) Netanyahu has adopted stiff positions
pertaining to the implementation of the peace agreements, Jewish settlements,
Jerusalem and the establishment of the Palestinian State.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. In a previous interview with the Islamist thinker,
Dr. Abdulla Nafisi, he said in his comment to Mr. Erbakan's participation
in the Turkish government that the Islamic movements and parties are not
prepared to form a government but only to be in the opposition. Do you agree?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I somehow disagree with
him. But because the nature of the opposition only requires raising a voice
against the unacceptable policies adopted by our governments, the opposition
does raise its voice against such policies. The role of the Islamists is
one of strength because they stick to their principles. But strategically,
the Islamic movement should establish a stand and confront the realities
and practice the &quot;art of possibilities&quot; -the politics. They should
ascend the stairs step by step beginning with reality and ending with the
last step which is the principles and the strategic aims. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is early to evaluate Mr. Erbakan's participation in
government. But in general, I think the positive aspects outweigh the negatives.
He took the ministries of services which made his party very close to the
people and gained more popularity. I even think that his decision to increase
the salaries of the army soldiers had positive reactions among the various
ranks of the army.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What is the relation between the IAF and the Muslim
Brotherhood?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> It is a strong relation.
The MB refused to register their organization as a political party because
their arena of activity covers more than just politics. They have their
own religious, educational, cultural, charitable and political programmes.
But when the Law of Parties was issued, the MB found that they should be
involved in the political activity with a new mechanism and means. Therefore,
a decision was made to establish a political party. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Anyone from the MB is free and not forced to join this
party which is the IAF. Also the Islamists and the common people can join
this party. Even the Christians can join our party provided they believe
in the Islamic Shariah (Law) as the authority and the law that should be
implemented. Therefore, the IAF is open for the Muslim Brothers and for
the ordinary people although the majority of members of the party are from
the MB. According to the Law, any political party should be administratively,
politically, and financially independent from any other organization. Therefore,
our party is independent from the MB. But this does not prevent the two
from coordinating with each other. They also have policies and programmes
that conform with each other. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>A Jew who killed a non-Jew was exempt from
human judgment </FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Israel Shahak</FONT></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(Part 2 of 2)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Elbaum says that &quot;the Judea and Samaria rabbis are
not satisfied with being vested with spiritual power only. They even began
developing their own extensive intelligence network, using information gathered
from religious or otherwise sympathetic officers from the army's high command,
General Moshe Bar Khuchba (a member of the General staff) who recently died
after retiring from the army, was named by the Judea and Samaria rabbis
as one of their major informants. He is said to have been informing the
rabbis regularly in advance about plans for army operations in the Territories.
Upon learning about him, other offices followed in his footsteps, proffering
information of their own.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Nadav Shargai (Haaretz, 18 February, 1994),
G.E. rabbis conceive of religious settlements as established &quot;not only
to create facts on the ground , but also to affect the hearts and minds
of Jewish people..&quot; Shargai quotes rabbi Azriel Ariel, the son of rabbi
Yakov Ariel, who also eulogized Goldstein at his death, as saying that &quot;for
a majority of Jews, the settlements have failed in restoring the sacred
linkage between the Jews and Erez Yisrael.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even more articulate is rabbi Yair Dreyfus. He argues that
Israel is about to commit &quot; a spiritual apostasy the day the agreement
with the PLO takes effect. That day will mark the end of the Jewish-Zionist
era in the sacred history of the land of Israel. Historian will record that
the Jewish-Zionist era lasted from 1948 to 1993. It ended when most Jews
turned into Canaanites. Hence 1993 marks the beginning of the Canaanite
era...In that era of sin, Jewish political thought, cultural-educational
thought included, will be polluted by-as he terms it-speedy Arabization.'
The Jewish left will continue its treacherous practice of dismissing Jews
from key posts and replacing them with Arabs. This will be done in the government,
the Broadcasting Authority, the Land Authority, editorial boards of the
newspapers, boards of directors of the universities. Every important position
will be filled by an Arab.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Let me proceed to a discussion of political consequences
of the Gush Emunim theology. Although the interaction of that theology and
politics has been discussed by the Hebrew press extensively, for the convenience
of the readers I will rely as much as I can on two English language books
mentioned above, those of Lustick and Harkabi. Let me begin with the fundamental
tenet of Gush Emunim, namely the assumption that the Jewish people are &quot;peculiar
(pp.74-76) discusses this tenet in terms of G.E.'s denial of the classical
Zionist claim that &quot;Jewish life had been distorted on both the individual
and the collective levels by the abnormality of Diaspora existence.&quot;
and that only by undergoing &quot;a process of normalization&quot; by emigrating
to Palestine and forming a Jewish state there, could Jews become like any
other nation. Indeed, all secular Zionists were united in wanting the Jews
to thus become &quot;normal.&quot; Lustick maintains that for G.E. this
&quot;was the original delusion of the secular Zionists.&quot; G.E.'s argument
is that the secular Zionist leaders measured that &quot;normality&quot;
by applying non-Jewish standards. They took into account certain nations
which they considered not only &quot;normal&quot; but advanced and treated
them as models for Jews to emulate for the sake of becoming both normal
and advanced. But according to G.E., &quot;Jews are not and cannot be a
normal people&quot; because &quot;their eternal uniqueness&quot; is &quot;the
result of the covenant God made with them at Mount Sinai.&quot; Therefore,
as explains rabbi Aviner, a G.E. leader quoted by Lustick, &quot;while God
requires other normal nations to abide by abstract codes of 'justice and
righteousness,&quot; such laws do not apply to Jews.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Harkabi discusses issues which Lustick fails to mention,
for example the Halachic teachings on murder. The murder of a Jew, particularly
when committed by a non-Jew is considered by Jewish orthodoxy the most venal
crime possible. but Harkabi quotes a G.E. leader, Rabbi Israel Ariel, who,
relying on the code of &quot;Maimonides&quot; and on the strict canon of
the Halacha, says that &quot;A JEW WHO KILLED A NON-JEW WAS EXEMPT FROM
HUMAN JUDGMENT, AND HAS NOT VIOLATED THE PROHIBITION OF MURDER.&quot; (p.
50). This, as Harkabi notes on the next page, should be borne in mind when
&quot;the is voiced that all non-Jewish residents of the Jewish state be
dealt with according to Halachic regulations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The G.E. rabbis have quite often reiterated that the Jews
who had killed Arabs should be free from all punishment. This is why the
religious settlers and their sympathizers dwell so much upon &quot;shedding
Jewish blood&quot;, while never showing a slightest concern about Arabs
killed by the Jews. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A practical consequence of G.E.'s theology is its impact
on the conduct of the Israeli authorities in the Territories and on wide
segments of Jewish society, in Israel and the Diaspora alike. G.E. encourages
them to behave in a manner which is increasingly immoral and cruel. This
subject is dealt with honestly by Harkabi, who extensively quotes rabbi
Shlomo Aviner, rabbi T.Y. Kook and Rabbi Ariel. All three define all the
Arabs living in Palestine as &quot;thieves because, since the land was once
Jewish, all property to be found on that land REALLY belongs to the Jews
(pp. 145-46). The doctrine has other horrifying applications which I don't
need to list, because Harkabi has listed them in the following sections
of the already referred to chapter of his book&quot; &quot;From Expulsion
to Annihilation&quot; (pp. 147-50); &quot;The status of Non Jews under Israeli
Rule: 'Resident Alien' &quot;, (pp.151-6); &quot;Idolaters&quot; (pp.156-9),
&quot; 'When Israel is Stronger than the Nations' &quot;, (pp.159-63). Let
me, however, quote one comment of Harkabi which I find particularly prescient
(p. 162): &quot;Proponents of this view (that due to God's help Israel is
stronger than all other nations) hold that Israel need have no fear of further
wars, and can even provoke them at will. Rabbi Shlomo Aviner had written:
&quot;We must live in this land even at the price of war. Moreover, even
if there is peace, we must instigate wars of liberation in order to conquer
it' &quot;. It must be borne in mind that for G.E. Sinai and Lebanon (and
much else besides) have yet to be &quot;liberated.&quot; Suppose Gush Emunim
is able to use Israeli nuclear power. It is not difficult to guess what
purpose would it be used for. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some pertinent details omitted by Lustick, have to be retrieved
from Harkabi, who quotes the views of &quot;Mordechai Nisan, a lecturer
on the Middle East at the Hebrew University in Jerusalem&quot; published
in Kivunim, &quot;an official publication of the World Zionist Organization
(August, 1984).&quot; According to Dr. Nisan, who quotes a passage from
Maimonides, frequently referred to by E.E. as an authoritative source, a
Gentile, permitted to reside in the Land of Israel &quot;must accept to
pay taxes and to suffer the humiliation of servitude.&quot; Furthermore,
Nisan demands that such a Gentile &quot;be held down and not raise his head
against Jews. Non-Jews must not be appointed to any office or position of
power over Jews. If they refuse to live a life of inferiority, then this
will signify rebellion and the unavoidable necessity of Jewish warfare against
their very presence in the land of Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In short, &quot;an official publication of the World Zionist
Organization&quot; has been publishing proposals no different than anything
written before the Holocaust by Hitler about the Jews. It can be surmised
that, just as in the case of Hitler, the doctrine of Jewish inferiority
led inevitably to the extermination of the Jews when the opportunity arose,
so the doctrine of the inferiority of the Gentiles living in the land of
Israel will lead inevitably to the extermination of the Palestinians if
Gush Emunim seizes power in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes things even worse is that inferiority of the
Non-Jews, even if in versions milder than that of G.E., is an important
of Jewish orthodoxy (accepted in the U.S. also by the Conservative Jews).
The same belief is still affecting many secular Jews, and is a major feature
of Israeli policies towards the Arabs, especially in the Territories, even
if it is somewhat extenuated by pragmatic considerations. A case in point
is a story reported by Uzi Benziman in Haaretz, January 10, 1991.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Benziman notes that &quot;according to a law force in the
territories, a hostile action entitling its victim to claim a compensation
from the government is defined as an Arab riotous action against the Jews,
but not vice versa&quot;. Such open racism, whose examples could be cited
again and again, surpasses anything ever contemplated by South Africa racism,
but it can be compared to the Nazi Nuremberg laws against the Jews. Hence
Harkabi's comment on Nisan is very much to the point. &quot;I do not know
how many Jews share his &quot;Nisan's) belief, but the publication of the
article in a leading Zionist periodical is a cause for grave concern.&quot;
Actually, there exists a cause for a concern graver still. An overwhelming
majority of Western intellectuals have refused to pay any heed to a Nazilike
ideology only because it is Jewish, while discussing Islamic fundamentalism
incessantly.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Outside Israel, where in contrast to apologetics and propaganda
on Jewish themes, real knowledge of Jewish history and religion is sorely
lacking, the very possibility of such a civil war appears awfully far-fetched.
But in Israel, where Jewish history is taught in schools an seriously studied
by many adults, and where the real nature of the Jewish religion can be
directly experienced, the prospect of such a civil war between Jews sounds
eminently reasonable. After all, much of Jewish history is filled with civil
wars, or with rebellions accompanied by civil wars.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Conclusion</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Inspite of its solid evidence much discussed in Israel
itself, and even published in English by Jewish scholars of impeccable reputation
like Lustick and Harkabi, many readers may find the conclusions of this
article astounding. It is the Western Media and a large majority of writers
whom Edward Said termed &quot;the orientalists&quot;, who must bear the
responsibility for the fact that while Islamic fundamentalism is widely
discussed, the discussion of the Jewish one is virtually banned. This applies
to run-of-the-mill radical publications even more than to conservative ones.
This ban on discussion of Jewish fundamentalists is but an extension of
the more all-inclusive ban on discussing Jewish racism and chauvinism. It
is an offense against freedom of speech, so often avowed by Western media
when convenient. But the ban also makes it impossible to know anything about
Middle Eastern politics. It is because Jewish racism and chauvinism in general,
and the Gush Emunim ideology in particular, have become that politics' central
issues. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Dakemseh, Abu-Dayyah and Illusion of Justice</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Erik Paul</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is not as if two wrongs make a right, but it is interesting
to note different conceptions of justice. At present, the Jordanian soldier,
Ahmad Dakemseh is standing trial for the shooting and killing of seven Israeli
school girls while they were on an outing at Baqoura, which is in the north
of Jordan. Though there have been countless Israeli atrocities committed
against not only all civilian Palestinians, but several Arab populations
in general, there is still no valid excuse for shooting unarmed school girls
even though they did provoke the soldier by making fun of him while he was
praying.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>How will justice be served when Dakamseh's sentence is
passed? There is no doubt that Dakamseh will receive some form of meted
punishment, but it is not clear at this time, just what that punishment
will be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Just beyond the border that divides Israel and Jordan,
the ruthless killing of Palestinian civilians goes on. But it is not just
the murders that are disturbing. It is the whole way of life that the indigenous
people of the Holy Land are forced to endure. Their land has been, and still
is being confiscated from them inch by inch and acre by acre. The Palestinians
are</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>separated into what is more like two huge concentration
camps, which includes the West Bank and Gaza, with little or no intercommunication
between the two. Continuous closures of these two concentration camps is
just another day of hard reality for the inhabitants of the two imprisoned
areas. The economy in both camps is lower than ever before and many of the
able-bodied Palestinian work force are without jobs and hence any source
of income. Many of the young have been deprived of any form of regular schooling
and this in itself has greatly affected the make-up of the people. And now
to make matters worse, there is the double occupation of the Holy land by
the Israelis and their cohorts, the PNA, that the Palestinians are forced
to endure. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On May 4, Khalid Abu Dayyah was murdered in cold blood
in an Israeli hospital where he had been sent for treatment due to the severe
beatings he suffered from in an Israeli prison. Provoked by verbal and obscene
attacks by Israeli policemen on Islam and the Prophet Mohammed, Khalid screamed,
&quot;Stop, stop!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>All at once, police and sentries leapt on Khalid and beat
him savagely until he died. How ironic that the very people who should have
saved Khalid's life were the cause of his death. There are thousands of
Khalids. Their plight is endless and drags on day by day. But no one will
be sentenced and tried for the blood of this innocent man who was arrested
without cause. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the PA Attorney General, Mr. Al Kidrah, has
been fired because he was suspected of accepting bribes. But there is another
side to Al Kidrah. he is notorious for the torture and sometimes death of
Palestinians held in PA prisons. And it was Al Kidrah who on several occasions
arrested Dr. Sarraj, a renowned Palestinian psychiatrist because he raised
human rights issues. Dr. Sarraj was beaten and kicked and held without trial
for allegedly assaulting an armed Palestinian policeman. What punishment
will Al Kidrah receive if any?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There are some non-Palestinian Arabs who hold the view
that Israelis only torture and abuse Palestinians. But this is not true,
for Israelis don't really care which nationality Arabs happen to have. Their
main interest is serving Zionism and ridding Palestine and the surrounding
areas of Arab inhabitants.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And who will punish those responsible for the Israeli attack
on a U.N. compound in South Lebanon at Qana where 100 Lebanese civilians
including women and children who had sought refuge at the compound were
deliberately killed in the April 1996 shelling?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is certain that the killers of Khalid Abu Dayyah will
never be brought to trial. In fact, they might have even been commended
for the murder of a helpless man. After all, one less Palestinian will pave
the way for 1000 more Jewish settlers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Justice must be served. But it must be served on all counts.
The sanctity of life has to be preserved. It matters not who that life belongs
to, whether Israeli, Palestinian, Jordanian, or other. What matters is that
there can never be peace in the Middle East as long as there are double
standards and as long as Israelis adopt the view that only they are entitled
to live in peace and well being.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmad Dakamseh might be executed for his deed though he
over-reacted to the fact that people were ridiculing his religion. The killers
of Khalid Abu-Dayyah will go unpunished and in the meantime, Arabs will
sit back complacently thinking that, after all, it is only the Palestinians
that the Israelis are killing and not members of other Arab countries. But
we have proof that as far as the Israelis are concerned the only sanctified
life is that of a Jew. Who knows after the whole of Palestine is consumed,
what Arab nation and people will become the next Palestine? As long as the
rest of the Arab and Muslim world sits back and watches apathetically the
destruction of a people, a land and the Holy places as well, it won't be
long before the insatiable appetite of the cruel and ruthless oppressors
will look outward for more land and resources to build the Greater Israel
at the expense of the Arab people. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Colonial Bulldozers Uproot Palestinian Existence</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It does not take a genius to realize what the current Israeli
government is planning to do regarding the final status negotiations. It
has been forming a new 'de facto' situation to be the basis for the final
talks in which a final agreement is to be reached regarding the refugees,
occupied Jerusalem, Jewish settlements and the borders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Concerning the new map being drawn by the Israeli procedures
and practices, signs show beyond any doubt that 60% of the Palestinian land
in the West Bank will stay under Israeli occupation. Benjamin Netanyahu,
the Israeli premier, has allocated about $350 million for constructing new
Jewish settlements and fattening the already existing ones, despite the
fact that over 25% of the houses built in the settlements are vacant, according
to a recent U.S. government report.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the period from June 1967 to September 1996, the
Israeli occupation authorities confiscated over 73% of the land in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip. While making it easier for the settlers to build
houses, the Palestinians - the original owners of the land- had to face
a wide range of Israeli procedures and policies which in many cases obstructed
their housing rights and the right to build and spread out. They had to
face house demolitions and confiscation of land and real estate, under the
allegation of the absence of their owners from the occupied territories,
as well as the construction of the so-called bypass roads, fattening the
Jewish settlements in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, and the levying of high
taxes, fees and fines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the current government came into office, colonial
policies flourished in fulfilment of the Prime Minister&iacute;s promises
to his electors. Jerusalem was the main core in implementing such policies.
The recent construction on Jabal Abu Ghneim was just one example of the
Israeli government&iacute;s insistence on &quot;changing the ethnic and
demographic distribution in the city&quot; according to Shlomo Gazeen.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the belief that Jerusalem is the eternal united capital
of Israel, consecutive Israeli governments have worked hard at evacuating
Palestinian residents from the Holy City, or at least reducing their numbers
to the minimum level possible.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a result of these unjust policies, the Arabs who were
a majority in the city in 1967 are now a minority forming only 30% of the
total population of Jerusalem, although population growth among Arabs is
4.5% compared with only 1.3% among Jews. The Israeli authorities were not
satisfied with the 10 settlements in Jerusalem, but went on building new
settlements, in addition to fattening those already existing by adding 20,000
new housing units. As if that were not enough to minimize Arab existence
in the Holy City, the Israeli authorities began dealing with the Palestinian
citizens of Jerusalem with a set of procedures which included: confiscation
of their identity cards, cancellation of residential permits of any of those
living abroad or even those living outside the district of the Jerusalem
municipality, and denying the registration of newly born babies on any of
the parents' identity cards if born outside the occupied territories or
beyond the municipal borders of Jerusalem. The Israeli authorities also
refuse to renew travel permits for those who work outside the city or are
studying in foreign countries.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In addition, Jerusalem municipality is demolishing Arab
houses built without licences without prior warning. In the last six months,
more than 1,000 houses were built without licences by Palestinians in East
Jerusalem after failing to obtain official licences from the Israeli municipal
authorities. Israel also imposes very high licence fees which Palestinians
cannot afford. The Israeli Mayor of Jerusalem, Ehude Olmert, has promised
to demolish these houses. He considers them a &quot;cancer threatening Israeli
sovereignty in Jerusalem, and damaging the infrastructure needed for living
in a united city.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Pouring oil on troubled waters or adding
salt to the wound</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Probably one of the ironies of the colonial process now
taking place in Palestine is the role played by the land brokers. Some Palestinian
land brokers facilitate selling land to Israelis. They use fraud and forgery
or even violence to force Palestinians into selling their land. Because
of the dangerous role these brokers are playing, the Palestinian Authority
set a law prohibiting the selling of land to Israelis, ignoring the big
fuss the Israeli government is making over the law. Needless to say that
such a law could also lead to disastrous consequences upon the Palestinian
society if recklessly used.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al-Qastal Before 1948The village stood on top of a high,
rounded hill, overlooking wide expanses in all four directions. It overlooked
the Jerusalem-Jaffa highway to the north and northeast, to which it was
linked by a secondary road. Its position over the highway accorded al-Qastal
a strategic significance. The village name was derived from the Latin castellum,
the term for the Roman castle that was built on the site. The old Roman
castle was renovated or rebuilt and named Belveer des Croises during the
Crusader period. [Thompson, Goncalves, and van Cangh 1988:78] In the late
nineteenth century, al-Qastal was located on a rocky hilltop. There were
several springs outside the village to the east. [SWP (1881) III:18] Classified
as a hamlet by the British Mandate government's Palestine Index Gazetteer,
the village had a semicircular plan, and its houses were built of stone.
More recent construction extended along the eastern slopes of the region
around the al-Qastal hill. The village residents, who were predominantly
Muslim, maintained a shrine for a local sage, one Shaykh Karaki, on the
western edge of the village. The villagers relied on the neighboring city
of Jerusalem for many of their needs. They cultivated rainfed grain, vegetables,
and fruit and olive trees. Their agricultural lands were concentrated in
a rectangular strip southwest of the village. In 1944/45 a total of 42 dunums
was planted in cereals; 169 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards,
of which 50 were planted with olive trees.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The occupation of al-Qastal took place before the official
start of Operation Nachshon (see Bayt Naqquba, Jerusalem District). Israeli
historian Benny Morris claims, improbably, that it was &quot;the first Arab
village during the 1948 war to be taken by the Haganah with the aim of permanent
conquest and occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palmach's Fourth Battalion attacked and occupied the
village on 3 April. A spearhead unit of commandos stormed the village before
dawn; it was soon followed by the main force, which fought off counterattacks
into the night. The New York Times correspondent reported that there were
battles around the village over the following few days. According to Palmach
documents, the initial attack was unopposed and the village's defenders
and the inhabitants had left beforehand. But Palestinian historian 'Arif
al-'Arif states that it was defended by fifty of the village militiamen,
who only withdrew when their ammunition ran out. A report in the Palestinian
newspaper Filastin confirms that the villagers had evacuated after an attack
in mid-March but says that a number of the village's men remained to defend
it. The paper said that the defenders broke through the siege laid by the
Haganah forces and retreated to a nearby village. On 5 April, the Haganah
occupiers built a barbed-wire fence around their positions and two days
later used training planes to drop bombs on Palestinian forces surrounding
al-Qastal, according to the New York Times. The village was retaken by Palestinian
guerrillas in a battle on 8 April during which their leader, Jerusalem commander
'Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, was killed. The Haganah account states that a
number of Jewish commanders also were killed while retreating. Several days
of heavy fighting had preceded the final Palestinian counterattack, which
was launched at 1:30 P.M. under cover of mortar and machinegun fire. The
New York Times correspondent wrote, &quot;They swarmed up the steep boulder-covered
slopes shouting their battle cries.&quot; By 3:00 P.M., a force drawn from
a number of Palestinian guerrilla groups had broken into the village.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Palmach forces reoccupied it in an assault which
began on the night of 8-9 April. When they approached the village this time,
the brigade was surprised to find it deserted; on 9 April, most of the men
who had recaptured it were participating in the funeral of their slain commander,
which was being held at the mosque of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.
The Palmach forces surrounded the village with a number of armored vehicles
to prevent reinforcements from arriving and proceeded to overrun it. The
attack occurred at the same time as the massacre at Dayr Yasin, less than
5 km away. The History of the Haganah states that &quot;el Qastal returned
once again and forever into Jewish hands.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As soon as they had reoccupied it, the Palmach units started
to destroy its houses, thus setting a precedent for all the villages taken
during Operation Nachshon. The reason given for the levelling of the village
was that it would make the site easier to defend and prevent it from falling
back into Arab hands. Palestinian historian al-'Arif states that all buildings
in the village, including the shrine/mosque, were destroyed by Zionist forces.
A New York Times story confirms that the village mosque was destroyed, but
states that this had occurred in the previous month, during the night of
16 March. The newspaper article quoted 'Abd al-Qadir al-Husayni, who was
later to lose his life fighting for the village, as saying that the demolition
was a &quot;shameful act&quot; and that the mosque &quot;has never been
used for anything but worship.&quot; [F:18/3/48, 4/4/48; M:111-12; NYT:18/3/48,
4/4/48, 5/4/48, 6/4/48, 7/4/48, 8/ 4/48, 9/ 4/48, 10/4/48; Q:43; R:156-65;

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The settlement of Maioz Tziyyon (164133) was established
in 1951 on village lands. It was later joined with Mevasseret Yerushalayim
(165134), founded in 1956 on the lands of Qalunya (165133), to form the
Jerusalem neighborhood known as Mevasseret Tziyyon (164134). [P:116, 217,
269; Thompson, Goncalves, and van Cangh 1988:76-78, 104-9]</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Village Today</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The southern, northern, and eastern slopes of the site
are covered with stone rubble and the ruins of stone terraces, half-concealed
by wild grass. The ruins of the old castle lie on the mountain top. An underground
shelter has been built on the site, southwest of the fortress. Military
trenches can be seen north and east of the fortress. Olive, carob, and fig
trees grow on the north and west sides of the site, and cactuses grow on
the southern side The entire site, including parts of the fortress, serves
as an Israeli tourist attraction.<BR>
