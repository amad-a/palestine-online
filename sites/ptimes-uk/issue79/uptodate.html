<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> Israel admits Hamas didn't plan bomb attacks</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (2 February) </FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli authorities have admitted that earlier Israeli
reports  alleging the arrest of two Hamas fighters on their way to carry
out a bomb attack in Israel were &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;lacking
credibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, the Israeli Hebrew press reported that General
Security Service (GSS) officials criticized Internal Security Minister Avigdor
Kahlani for &quot;blowing up the issue out of proportion by channeling false
information to the international media.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Hebrew daily <I>Yedeot Ahranot</I>, GSS
officials rebuked Kahlani for &quot;contributing to weakening GSS credibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yedeot also reported one GSS official as saying that &quot;this
issue ought to teach Kahlani a lesson in how to keep his mouth shut.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, news agencies and leading television networks
quoted Israeli officials as saying that &quot;two would-be Hamas suicidal
bombers were arrested while on their way to carry out a suicide bomb-attack
inside Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli radio, often a mouthpiece of the GSS, even
pointed out that large amounts of TNT were found in the two suspects' cars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and
other Israeli officials used the report to justify Israeli refusal to implement
the long overdue Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 30 January, the people of the Bedouin village of Ksefeh
in the Negev demonstrated against Kahlani, calling on him to resign and
apologize for &quot;the libelous and malicious accusations he made against
the people of our village.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Knesset member Talab al Sanei, a Bedouin, said Kahalani
should have known what he was talking about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;He should have waited to know the truth before rushing
to tell Reuters that two Hamas bombers had been detained.&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a similar incident, Israeli police yesterday released
three Palestinian university students who had been arrested two weeks earlier
for &quot;aiding Hamas.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police sources said the charges were false.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The students, Fuaz Abu Ghosh and Yazid Yaghmour, both of
Beit Hanina neighborhood near Jerusalem, were reportedly placed in solitary
confinement for two weeks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two also told relatives their hands were tied and they
were forced to sit on low stools with their hands and legs fettered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli troops arrested on Sunday
six Najah University students while on their way to school.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops routinely erect roadblocks and
checkpoints on all roads and routs from and to Palestinian towns under Yasser
Arafat's PA administration.<BR>
