<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A peace agreement will become possible when Israel's leaders
finally  accept the truth that granting Palestinian freedom and political
 independence is not a matter of Israeli altruism but an essential  precondition
for Israel's security. That is the truth which Yitzhak  Rabin came to understand
and which made possible the Oslo accords. Absent such understanding, even
the smallest compromise is seen as a  gratuitous gift to an undeserving
adversary. That is an attitude that  will not prevent the emergence of a
Palestinian state but will further  damage Israel's security interests.

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On the day Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai launched
his first  official visit to Ankara earlier this month, Turkey was being
harshly  criticized by its supposed Muslim brothers at a summit meeting
of  Islamic nations in Tehran. The criticism, which focused on Ankara's
ties  to the United States and Israel, prompted Turkish President Suleyman
Demirel to leave the conference early.The Turkish military, the most powerful
institution in the country, was  unperturbed by the rebuff. Turkey was the
first Islamic nation in the  world to recognize Israel in 1949 and has maintained
more or less  friendly relations with Israel ever since. <B>The Washington
Post,  December 23, 1997</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There's no denying that Turkey has a serious human-rights
problem. But  the European Union was less than convincing when it cited
Turkey's  shortcomings in this area as justification for not considering
it for  future membership. Turkey is correct when it complains that ethnic,
 religious and cultural bias played a key role in the EU's shortsighted
 decision. For all its problems, Turkey deserves to be treated better. As
a  reliable member of NATO, it stood firmly with the West against the  Soviet
Union throughout the Cold War. At the same time, it has been a  faithful
U.S. ally in the volatile Middle East. <B>The Chicago Tribune, December
22, 1997</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>THE United States will be the ultimate arbiter in decisions
over which Islamist militants should be detained or freed as part of moves
to put the Middle East peace process back on track according to Israeli
news reports yesterday. The agreement, worked out by Palestinian, Israeli
and US security officials, is aimed at assuaging fears that Yasser Arafat's
Palestinian Authority rounds up extremists after major atrocities and then
quietly releases them... The Yediot Aharonot daily newspaper claimed that
an agreement among the parties stipulates that the Palestinians will give
the US Central Intelligence Agency's representative in Israel advance notice
of the names of detainees they plan to release. The CIA will then inform
Israel of impending releases and Israel will be given an opportunity to
voice objections. In the end, the Palestinian Authority can release detainees
only with US approval, Yediot said. <B>The Guardian,  December 20, 1997</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> After two decades of hostility, leaders in Iran and the
U.S. are engaged  in a wary courtship, each signaling the other in recent
days that an  improvement in relations is no longer unthinkable. President
Clinton said Tuesday he hopes to establish an &quot;honest dialogue  with
Iran,&quot; indicating he welcomed conciliatory comments over the  weekend
by Iranian President Mohammed Khatami, who has worked to lessen  tension
with the U.S. since his landslide election last spring. <B>The Chicago Tribune,

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Farrakhan's foray into the Holy Land left no doubt where
he stands on  U.S.-mediated peacemaking in the region. He sent a strong
message of  solidarity with Palestinians as part of what he says is a 52-nation
 tour, which includes planned stops in several countries at odds with  U.S.
policy, including Libya, Iran, Iraq, North Korea and Cuba. Arriving in the
Jordanian capital of Amman, he said at a news conference  that he had dropped
his plans to pray at Jerusalem's Al-Aqsa Mosque,  Islam's third-holiest
shrine, after reports he would be greeted by  protesters. <B>The Chicago
Tribune,  December 16, 1997</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The United States has voted against these resolutions (UN
resolutions condemning Jewish settlements)  in the General  Assembly, vetoed
proposed resolutions in the Security Council, and  refused to press Israel
to adhere to resolutions that the United States  has supported. However,
when in 1990 Iraq refused to heed UN demands to  withdraw from Kuwait, the
United States waited only six months before  using force to free Kuwait
and protect its oil supplies. No wonder Arabs  charge that US policy in
the Middle East reeks of hypocrisy. <B>The Boston Globe, December 15,1997<BR>
