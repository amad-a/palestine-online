<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel: The only country that uses torture
openly</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In November, 1996, the Israeli Supreme Court lifted an
injunction against the use of &quot;moderate physical force&quot; in the
interrogation of  Palestinian detainees.  The injunction was in place since
the death of Abd Samad Harizat, who was beaten to death during interrogation
in April 1995. This past May, a United Nations committee on torture, an
Israeli High Court ruling and another torture death of a Palestinian prisoner
rekindled the issue of torture in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>       Israel is one of 102 nations that have agreed to
outlaw torture by signing the non-binding Convention on Torture in 1987.
 Since the intifada  began late that same year, over 20 Palestinian political
prisoners have  been tortured to death in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>   &quot;Israel is the only Western country that openly
uses torture,&quot; said  Lea Tsemel, a veteran defense lawyer and a founder
of the Public  Committee Against Torture in Israel. &quot;This is not some
brute in the secret  services beating up a prisoner. It's done in the open.
There is a quiet  legitimization by a high-ranking commission and government
ministers.&quot;    </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In early May, a United Nations human rights committee
determined that Israel's interrogation practices, such as shaking prisoners
and subjecting  them to long periods of loud music, cold air and being tied
up, amounted to torture and should be halted immediately.  The Committee
Against Torture also denounced the use of death threats, beatings and other
interrogation methods used by Israelis against Palestinian prisoners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;This conclusion is particularly evident where
such methods of interrogation are combined, which appears to be the standard
case,&quot; committee member Peter Thomas Burns said.   Burns, the United
Nations committee member specializing in Israel, said the standards of the
 Convention Against Torture were absolute while Israel seems to think that
treatment of detainees could be modified to fit the circumstances. He said
the international agreement prohibits &quot;exceptional circumstances&quot;
as excuses for torture and questioned how Israel could define prolonged
 interrogation, shaking, sleep deprivation and awkward and painful sitting
positions as anything but torture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Two weeks after the special United Nations Committee
denounced Israel for torture, the Israeli High Court rejected a petition
filed by a Palestinian human rights group to stop the torture of Omar Ghneimat,
who claimed he had been tortured during 47 days of interrogation.  Ghneimat
said Israeli interrogators had forced him to lie on the ground while handcuffed
and jumped on his body, kicked and beat him, dragged his body on the floor
while handcuffed, tied him into painful positions so that he</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>could not sit or stand, forced him to stand in a squatting
position for long periods of time, and put him in tight handcuffs which
caused his fingers, arms and legs to swell.  The petition to stop his torture
was brought to the Israeli High Court by The Palestinian Society for the
Protection of Human Rights and the Environment (LAW).     </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Omar Ghneimat was arrested in March as part of a crackdown
on  suspected Hamas members shortly after his brother Moussa died while
carrying out a bombing attack on a Tel Aviv cafe that killed three Israelis.
 Another brother was also arrested, along with others from the West Bank
village of Serif.  They are suspected of being responsible for kidnapping
and killing an Israeli soldier last September. In the High Court decision,
the  police were ordered to investigate the causes of Ghneimat's bruises
and cuts since there were inconsistencies between Ghneimat's and the interrogator's
testimonies. The Court decided to reject LAW's petition since the state
attorney notified the Court that &quot;at this stage&quot; no more physical
pressure was being used against Ghneimat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     LAW'S attorney argued that &quot;physical pressure&quot;
was an ambiguous term which the Court could not rely upon and did not include
the  psychological torture typically utilized by the Shabak including sleep
 deprivation. She also argued that the state attorney had made no  commitment
to refrain from torturing Ghneimat in the future and that it was upon the
Court to enforce the international prohibition against torture and order
the Shabak to refrain from any future torture especially in the light of
Ghneimat's bruises and cuts.  The President of the High Court, Aaron Barak,
rejected this argument and told LAW's attorney that she could always come
back to the Court if the Shabak continues to torture Ghneimat.   </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Pictures of Ghneimat's bruised arms were printed in
both Israeli and Arabic newspapers and caused an embarrassment to the Israeli
security services.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     On 16 May, shortly after the High Court ruling, Khaled
Abu Daiyya  was arrested while with his wife in Jerusalem. The father of
three children from the Jerusalem village of Beit Safafa was taken to the
Russian Compound jail and there, according to witness Mahmoud Abu Ter, was
severely beaten. Abu Ter heard beatings on at least two occasions, and saw
 Abu Daiyya's bloodied body.     </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Police transferred Abu Daiyya to the Givat Sha'ul
Psychiatric hospital, a move which he resisted. Abu Daiyya was then beaten
again on his hands, wrists and neck. He complained of throat pains and on
21 May was taken to Sharei Zedek hospital in Jerusalem. There he was tied
by his feet and hands and, when again he tried to resist, was beaten until
he died.  The exact time of death has been difficult to establish as the
hospital and police reports differ.  The autopsy, conducted by Dr. Jalal
Jabri, the General Director of the Autopsy Department of the Palestinian
Authority confirmed that the body was subjected to severe beating; the body
sustained blows with heavy instruments; the hands and feet had been bound;
there were fractures in various parts of the body; the bones of the right
side of the face, on an area spanning 15-20 centimetres, had been broken
by a dull, heavy instrument; there were deep lacerations on the right shoulder;
the 5th, 6th, 11th and 12th ribs were broken; and  there was severe internal
hemorrhaging.  Thousands of Palestinian political prisoners have been tortured
in Israeli prisons over the past few years.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Despite the international effort as well as a movement
in Israel to abolish the use of physical force against detainees, Israel
continues to insist on employing such measures during interrogations.  As
Palestinians step up their resistance to Netanyahu's increased confiscation
of West Bank lands, there is little doubt that many more Palestinians will
suffer the same brutal fate as Ghneimat and Abu Daiyya.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Ethnic Cleansing Continues in Palestine</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Robert W. McGee</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The government of occupied Palestine continues its ethnic
cleansing policy. After declaring a temporary moratorium on demolishing
Palestinian homes to keep the peace process alive, the Israeli military
bulldozed nineteen more homes in the village of Bir Naballa in the West
Bank.  The homes were located near a settler bypass road.  Forty-seven Palestinians,
mostly children under 12 years old, were made homeless in this latest human
rights abuse. The families could not remove their belongings before the
demolitions and the soldiers prevented their neighbors from helping them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This ethnic cleansing is only the latest in a series of
concerted efforts to destroy whole Palestinian neighborhoods that lie near
illegal Jewish settlements. According to the Israeli defense minister, 860
homes have been targeted for demolition. More than 2500 buildings in East
Jerusalem are also vulnerable to destruction, according to some reports.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This policy of demolishing Palestinian homes and building
settler homes and apartments on Palestinian land constitutes a major human
rights abuse. Most of the world's nations have condemned this policy.  Yet
the United States continues to ignore these abuses, taking the position
that the problem must be worked out between the Israelis and the Palestinians
without outside interference. Yet the USA does not hesitate to interfere
in every other part of the world where it declares itself to have a strategic
interest. U.S. taxpayers are being forced by the pro-Zionist Clinton administration
to pour billions of dollars into this corrupt regime to support these human
rights abuses.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>If the USA were really interested in seeing a resolution
to this concerted policy of nazi-like ethnic cleansing, it would cut off
aid to Israel and demand that the millions of Palestinians who have been
driven out of their own country be allowed to return to their homeland and
vote in elections. The U.S. government does not hesitate to supervise elections
in other countries. Why not offer to supervise an election in occupied Palestine
that includes Palestinians as well as Israelis? The U.S. government pays
lip service to democratic principles, but when it comes to actually protecting
human rights, it falls short.</FONT></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestine Times interviews Hamas' spokesman in Hebron</FONT></I></B></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> Natshi: Hamas is one movement, one policy</FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> Palestinians are convinced that resistance
is the sole option</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Interviewed by Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The spokesman of the Islamic Resistance Movement, Hamas,
in occupied Al Khalil (Hebron), Mr. Mohammed Jamal Natshi, stressed the
popularity of his Movement among the Palestinians which is increasing day
by day. He added that the Palestinians, including many of the Palestinian
Authority officials, are convinced that the Islamic solution is the only
means to restore the Palestinian rights. Mr. Natshi was one of the 400 Hamas
leaders and activists deported by the Israeli Occupation authorities to
Marjel Zuhour in South of Lebanon in the early 1990s. The following interview
was conducted with Mr. Natshi by telephone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What are the latest developments in Hebron?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Hebron is the centre of
the struggle. There are daily clashes and friction with the Occupation soldiers
and Jewish settlers, especially because they occupy Hebron's heart. Hebron
itself is surrounded by the Jewish settlers from all side. The Jewish settlement
in the Old Town's centre makes Hebron similar to Jerusalem regarding the
struggle over the religious places. The Jewish settlers in Hebron and round
it are the worst kind.  Because the downtown is over-populated by Hebronites,
the confrontations and clashes with the 400 settlers among them and with
the Israeli soldiers who protect them have become inevitable. The city has
witnessed in recent years several massacres against Hebronites, most notably
the one committed by the terrorist Baruch Goldstein, who killed 29 worshippers
in Hebron in February 1994. There are continuous shootings by the settlers
at the Palestinians who shop in the old market. The most recent infamous
incident was the distribution of blasphemous anti-Islamic drawings which
insulted Prophet Mohammed (peace be upon him) and the Virgin Mary. All these
issues make Hebron different than other cities of the West Bank concerning
the struggle against Occupation.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Many analysts attribute the escalation of clashes
and confrontations in Hebron to the strong presence of Hamas in the city.
Do you agree?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> Yes. There is no doubt that
the Islamic Movement in general and Hamas in particular enjoy a strong and
distinguished presence in Hebron. Elections in any institution or student
council are guaranteed to be in favour of the Islamic Movement. The rally
that was organized on 19 July, for instance, was attended by more than 25,000
citizens and reflected the real popularity and position of the Islamic Movement
among the Hebronites. It also proved that the common Muslims in the city
are aware of the reality that the input to the (peace) agreements did not
ease the people's lives but made them worse and more difficult. They understand
that the agreements did not bring any dividends at the security and economic
levels. Added to this are the continuous confiscation of land, harassment
by settlers against the citizens and the surrounding of Hebron's entrances
and exits by the Occupation soldiers. It is also known that the Islamic
awakening in Hebron has been deep-rooted and strong for a long time. Therefore,
Hamas' markedly strong presence in the city also has deep roots.  The continuous
struggle with the Occupation soldiers and settlers made the Hebronites see
the verses of the Holy Qur'an realized and coming true, especially those
which describe the Israelis, their allegations, and their misconduct. All
the aforesaid issues made the people strongly believe that the Islamic solution
is the only solution to their cause and to the Palestinian question in general.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. Concerning the recent intifadah in Hebron, circles
close to the self-rule authority allege that the authority's supporters
ignited the new uprising and that Hamas' supporters were involved as of
late..</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> In fact, Hamas was the first
to call for the intifadah (uprising) and the first to start it in Hebron
and Gaza Strip. This fact cannot be ignored. The first strike and different
activities of escalation were staged by Hamas.  But as for the clashes in
the heart of Hebron, Hamas has a different viewpoint which is supported
by all the citizens of the city: we support the escalation of clashes and
confrontations against the occupation and settlers away from the city's
centre. However, the centre of the Old Town should be full of life and normal
life activities shown through the ordinary movement of citizens in order
to siege the Jewish settlement there.  Otherwise, the occupation authorities
may use any escalation of clashes as a pretext to close the roads and markets
in the old city. All Hebronites support the Hamas attitude that this place
in particular is not suitable for resistance works. The citizens should
carry on with their normal life in that part of the city because the Jewish
settlers wish for it to become vacant in order to expand their settlement
in the heart of Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you assess the relation between Hamas and
the Palestinian Authority in the light of the recent incidents that followed
the Tel Aviv suicide bombing?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The facts have proved the
reliability and credibility of the Islamic Movement's attitude. Many people
who were supporting the self-rule authority and the peace process have become
convinced of our views and opinions which oppose the Oslo agreements. Therefore,
the PA is no longer able to defend its position and market these agreements
among the Palestinians in the forums, public meetings and even the dialogues
because every time the Occupation authorities do something, it reconfirms
the Islamic perspective and refutes the allegations of the PA.  No one accepts
the accusations made by the PA that the Islamists' activities and work destroy
the Palestinians' dreams and national interests. We have also many brothers
in the occupation jails.  There is security coordination between the PA
and Israel. The PA's security men and informers watch and follow the movements
of the Islamists. However, there is no direct harassment against the Islamists
because the PA itself is no longer able to make harassment-like arrests,
to deter Islamic establishments, or to prevent political activities like
rallies and lectures.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. What is your view concerning the national dialogue
in the light of the recent developments in the peace process?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> It is clear that the PA
by such dialogues wanted to show that it controlled the situation and that
it was able to gather the different factions and powers. The dialogues were
ceremonious. They were not serious. I think any Palestinian-Palestinian
dialogue has become subject to the ceiling of the Oslo Accords between Israel
and the PLO which will never make any political agreement among Palestinians
a success. For example, Hamas representatives in the national dialogue held
in Cairo in 1995 reached an agreement with the PLO representatives on certain
points, at the top of which were the public freedoms. But when Hamas representatives
returned to the West Bank and Gaza they were arrested by the PA. Even the
participants in the dialogues were not safe from arrest!  The reason is
that the (peace) accords oblige the PA to impose mass punishment when our
freedom fighters attack the settlers or the occupation soldiers. Therefore,
I do not see that such a dialogue would be useful or that it would achieve
serious objectives.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. If you are invited to a dialogue now, do you think
it will enhance the PA's position ?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> If a serious dialogue is
held now, it will foster the Islamic Movement's position because the common
people are convinced that the Oslo Accords are a complete failure and that
they added to our woes. Therefore, they want an alternative. Many of the
PA officials agree with the Islamic view that the resistance is the only
option. They believe that the negotiation process according to their fragile
perspective does not achieve even their simple objective which is the restoration
of 17% of Palestine. They have become sure that even this little objective
will never be achieved without force or resistance. All this makes the dialogue
in every meeting, forum or gathering in the Islamic Movement's favour.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you view the future of the PA after Chairman
Arafat?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I think that the source
of 70%  of the PA's dictatorship is Mr. Arafat's person. There is no doubt
that some dictatorship will remain because of the mentality that dominates
the largest faction of the PLO - Fateh. The same autocratic mentality will
continue but on a smaller scale.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. So you are optimistic of the future, although many
analysts expect internal disputes and struggles among the PA's security
bodies.</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I think the long struggle
'refines' the people. The Palestinian People experienced a long period of
continuous struggle which made them love freedom and hate oppression and
jails. Therefore, we hear loud shouts against autocracy, individualism and
dictatorship. I hope the future will carry freedom and openness with it.
I think Arafat's person is that which clings to autocracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. When we talk about the relation inside Hamas, we
come to the relation between its leaders in the occupied territories and
in diaspora. There is also some kind of distinction between the political
stands of Hamas leaders in the West Bank and of those in Gaza. What is the
reality of this relation?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A. </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>Disparity exists in the
viewpoints but without divisions in the leadership. This disparity is an
old-present phenomena in any intellectual or political movement. I do not
see any special difference between our leaders in the occupied territories
and in diaspora. The different views available here existed there outside
the occupied territories. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the media usually wants to make a fuss from nothing
depending on a certain statement here or somewhat different statement there.
There is one Movement and one policy. The decision is made after taking
the views of all members of the leadership in and outside the occupied territories.
Because the majority of the Palestinian People are living in diaspora, they
should play a role in drawing the policy of the Islamic Movement. In short,
the relation between the Hamas leaders inside and outside, in jails and
out of jails, is integrated.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q. How do you see the end of the final status talks
between Israel and the PLO? What will be your response?</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A.</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> I do not think the final
solution will be very different than the present one.  The offered solution
is autonomy.  The Occupation troops may redeploy in the residential areas
of the West Bank classified as areas B and C because the Zionists are not
concerned with the people. They want the land, the borders, the river and
the settlements. The people will be surrounded by Jewish settlements. The
final settlement on the serious issues like Occupied Jerusalem, the refugees
and the settlements will be dead and decided in Israel's favour.  As for
the response, I think the Islamic Movement will have its usual response.
It will enhance its resistance. The struggle against the Zionists will end
up to be dogmatic and God's promise will come true.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The rising star of Hamas</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Khalid Amayreh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem </FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>-  With
the peace process looking increasingly precarious, the Islamic Resistance
Movement (Hamas) has been reasserting its strength and popularity in the
occupied territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In the last few weeks, the Movement was able to mobilize
tens of thousands of Palestinians throughout the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip to reassert the &quot;Islam-is-the-solution&quot; slogan  and also
to renew Islamists' rejection of Israeli colonialism and American connivance
with it.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     On 20 July, as many as 20,000 Palestinians, mostly
young people, took part in a spectacular march in downtown Hebron. Carrying
green banners and large signs affirming the &quot;Islamic choice,&quot;
the huge multitude swore allegiance to the Prophet Muhammed and warned Jewish
settlers and other enemies not to play with fire, an obvious reference to
the blasphemous anti-Islamic posters pasted up by a Jewish female settler
on Arab storefronts in Hebron last month.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Sheikh Nayef Rajoub, a charismatic Islamist leader
from Dura, addressed the massive rally, stressing the &quot;ideological
nature of Jewish-Islamic enmity.&quot; Rajoub said it was within the normal
order of things that the Jews chose to attack the Prophet of Islam because
he, as did Jesus before him,  exposed their morbid mentality and hostility
to God.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Rajoub attacked the peace process, describing it as
&quot;explicitly futile&quot; and calling on the Palestinian people, Arabs
and Muslims all over the world to wash their hands of it once and for all.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     &quot;Under the rubric of this repugnant process,
Israel seized more land, destroyed more homes and consolidated its occupation
of our land,&quot; said Rajoub amid cheering approval from the huge audience.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Dr. Azzam Salhab of the Hebron University also castigated
the peace process, saying that it was ironic that while Israel is doing
everything conceivable to destroy it and eviscerate it of substance, the
Palestinian Authority is holding fast to it.  Moreover, Salhab called on
the PA to disregard American and Israeli blackmail and to adopt Islam, respect
human rights, political pluralism and freedom of the press and expression.
 </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In Tulkarm, thousands of townspeople took part in
a rally organized by the Islamic Movement on Monday, 22 July. The rally,
which coincided with the Prophet Muhammed's birthday anniversary, was addressed
by several Islamic speakers including Dr. Naji Subeiheh who urged Palestinians
to &quot;hold fast to the robe of God because if we don't then He won't
grant us victory.&quot;  Moreover, Subeiheh urged all Palestinians to be
united because &quot;disunity breeds division and division breeds defeat.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In Jabalya refugee camp in the Gaza Strip, the Islamic
Movement organized a massive rally under the slogan &quot;Allegiance to
the Prophet&quot; with the participation of thousands. Addressing the rally,
Dr. Nezar Rayyan said the profane posters in Hebron were merely a &quot;balloon
test&quot; by Jewish elements to see how Mulims would react if and when
the Jews attack the Al Aqsa Mosque.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Speaking on behalf of Hamas, Ayman Taha said Jewish
settlers would not have dared pasted the profane posters had it not been
for the Arab regimes which themselves adopt anti-Islamic policies.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Ismael Hanniya, a prominent Hamas leader and co-founder,
said it was imperative that Hamas increase its strength, adding that &quot;this
is a precondition for preventing the Palestinian arena from deteriorating
further.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Also addressing the rally was Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi,
former spokesman of the Islamist deportees in Marj al Zuhur, who said that
the Oslo agreement was already dead despite all artificial attempts to keep
it alive.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Al Rantisi denied &quot;hostile rumours&quot; that
Hamas was being divided against itself, saying the Movement was as united
as ever. </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Position Vindicated</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Observers notice that more and more Palestinians are
finding out that the views that Hamas has held all along vis-a-vis the peace
process have now been vindicated.  Ordinary Palestinians, who are not necessarily
affiliated with any political group, now readily point to the &quot;critical
situation&quot; in the occupied territories where Israeli occupation and
domination have grown more sinister than ever, though indirectly and vicariously.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, there are many Palestinians today who openly lament
the days of the &quot;direct occupation&quot; when the Palestinian cause
was still very much alive in the consciousness and conscience of the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Moreover, there are many Palestinians, and their number
is increasing, who have come to believe that the establishment of Yasser
Arafat's autonomous Authority was part of an American-led international
conspiracy to liquidate the Palestinian cause. Those who advocate this viewpoint
that the United States, Israel and the donor countries are well aware of
the extremely &quot;morbid and corrupt nature&quot; of the Palestinian Authority,
adamantly refuse to do anything that might hurt the Chairman. This, they
contend, shows that &quot;the whole thing amounts to a grand conspiracy
to liquidate the Palestinian cause by perpetuating the Israeli occupation
in connivance with the Palestinian Authority itself.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Part 1</FONT></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Introduction</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The topic covered in this paper is finding an audience,
not only among academicians and politicians, but also among everyday Americans
who have maintained an interest in the processes of  democracy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Increasingly the American public is becoming sensitive
to the power that money is exacting over American ideals, as well as to
special interest dominance over the collective American interest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The authors of this paper break new and thought provoking
ground. We are all hesitant, (and rightly so) to identify phenomena by racial,
class, or gender definitions but these authors have done exactly that, identifying
AIPAC and the Near East Policy Institute as the guardians and protectors
of Israeli interest in both the United States and Israel. The authors speak
to the enormous impact that these institutions have on American  domestic
and foreign policy. They were not intimidated by the fear of being labeled
'anti-Semitic' and did a good job of handling delicate issues tastefully
and honestly. Perhaps their courage will embolden others to do the same.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It should not be considered anti-Semitic or racist to subject
AIPAC and the Near East Policy Institute to scrutiny, or to have and share
an opinion as to how their activities are affecting America. The very existence
of the term anti-Semitic suggest the serious nature of the political phenomenon
that these authors seek to explore. Racism, which refers to the act of hating,
discriminating against, or targeting an individual or group based on racial
background or ethnicity, seems a sufficient word to identify the experience
of any individual or group that may find itself subjected to such treatment.
No form of racism need be accepted as more serious than any other, and neither
should any type of racism be ignored. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is important to point out that these institutions are
not the focus of these authors  analysis because they are Jewish,  nor because
their activities seem to be directed exclusively toward the good of Israel,
even sometimes at American expense. These institutions are the subjects
of analysis because they are effective. They are good at what they do. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  <B>The Effect on American Policy</B></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Domestic politics in the United States can be seen as a
continuous process of varying constituencies competing to persuade the formal
institutions to reflect their interests and objectives in the policies of
the nation. Lobbying organizations are often described as informal political
institutions, because although they are not mentioned in the Constitution
as official bodies, therefore their activities have profound affects on
the lives of American citizens and others. An understanding of their role
in the system is essential for the proper appreciation of policy making.
Political lobbies are organized attempts to influence government policy.
Their role, and particularly that of the leaders of the most important ones,
continues to be an issue of intense debate among political scientists who
seek to examine where power lies in the American system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This subject is of special interest to those who wish to
study U.S. foreign policy in the Middle East. Lobbying efforts in this area
are overwhelmingly Jewish-based and pro-Israeli in orientation. Is this
a problem? To some, it undoubtedly is not, but to others who see a grave
danger in forming American Middle East policy so exclusively towards a particular
objective, namely Israel right or wrong, this is most certainly a time of
serious problems. This paper details a few of the obstacles faced by our
government concerning its policy toward the Middle East and in particular
toward the world's Islamic revival.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before setting forth on this topic, it is important to
note that anti-Semitic attitudes, statements, or literature can only be
seen as wrong, pure and simple. Hatred of peoples, or discrimination against
them on the basis of nationality, ethnicity, gender, race, or religion must
be scorned, yet at the same time we must not shy away from the realities
of the world in which we live. As Americans or individuals living legally
in America, we have rights. One of those rights is the right of representation.
When a country reaches a point where a small minority population with an
iron solid stance has secured a hold on government policy, that country
restricts itself to one of two outcomes. The first is the oppression, misrepresentation,
or silencing  of different peoples within that country who might disagree
with them. The other outcome can, once recognized, evolve from the first.
This outcome is the revolt or lashing out of the various other peoples in
the country. America is currently deep within the first outcome.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The most powerful officially listed lobby on Capitol Hill
is the A.I.P.A.C. (America-Israel Public Affairs Committee). Its parallel
effort, directed at the executive branch of government and the Washington
policy elite, is at the Washington Institute for Near East Policy. The Washington
Institute, as it is often called, is a pro-Israeli institution that is something
between a think tank and a sophisticated propaganda apparatus. Its most
important function by far is its role as an elite influence apparatus for
Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Washington Institute grew directly out of AIPAC, having
been established initially as the organization's research branch. Since
its early origins, the influence of the Washington Institute for Near East
Policy has burgeoned uncontrollably, forming in essence what has become
a training ground and revolving door for pro-Israeli figures to obtain some
of the most powerful policy making positions in the national security apparatus
of the United States government. Just as the AIPAC has managed to place
its most extreme advocates in leading positions on congressional and senatorial
committees responsible for foreign affairs and appropriations, so has its
executive branch parallel, the Washington Institute, managed to propel,
essentially overnight, its own officers - and other staunch advocates for
whom Israel is top-priority into key positions in the Clinton Administration's
foreign, defense, and intelligence sectors, especially offices with Middle
East responsibilities. This influence at the executive level was virtually
unknown before the advent of President Clinton's first administration. Now
that it has been well-established, however, it will probably have to be
taken for granted as a permanent fixture on the Washington political landscape.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It was Clinton, whom Israelis laud as their best friend
ever to occupy the White House, who upon taking office appointed the head
of the Washington Institute, Dr. Martin Indyk, to be the Director of Middle
East Affairs at the National Security Council. Since Dr. Indyk, who is Jewish,
was not a citizen of the United States, but rather was of Australian nationality,
the citizenship process was speeded through so he could assume this post
in time for the inauguration. As it turned out, Martin Indyk became a citizen
of the United States of America a mere twelve days before taking office.
And it is he who is responsible for formulating the doctrine of dual containment
toward Iraq and Iran, with the more recent indirect additions of Libya and
Sudan, and by extension, Islamist movements such as Hamas and the Islamist
trend in general. Dual containment, although now coming under increasing
criticism from the Europeans and from some of the non-Israeli sectors of
the American foreign policy elite, remains official Clinton Administration
Mideast policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Next to Martin Indyk, who has since been removed from his
post and sent to Tel Aviv as Israel's U.S. Ambassador, is Dennis Ross, who
is equal in power to what Indyk was before. Bypassing the normal State Department
structure and its career officials, who were deemed not sufficiently committed
to Israel's interests, the Administration appointed Ross, who is also Jewish,
as the responsible official for America's entire involvement in the Middle
East peace process. And despite repeated accusations by his Palestinian
interlocutors that he is not an impartial mediator, he has remained in this
important position. The impartiality of his deputy, Aaron Miller, who is
also Jewish, is equally compromised when it comes to matters involving Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Although it is true that Ross was held over from the Bush
Administration, he was not the primary actor dealing with the Arab-Israeli
negotiations; that honor fell to James Baker, the Secretary of State, who
was normally responsible for all areas of American foreign policy. Baker
was an impartial mediator, which is precisely why he was detested by the
Israelis. Between administrations, before the appointment of Ross to head
up Clinton's Middle East peace process team, Ross had been slated to take
over as the head of the Washington Institute for Near East Policy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other friends of Israel in the Clinton Administration,
some of whom are more extreme in their pro-Israeli views than others, have
included Sandy Berger, a left-of-Labor type who is now the National Security
Adviser, as well as the two previous CIA directors, James Woolsey and especially
John Deutch, whose views are thought to be more extreme and who is thought
to have close relatives in Israel. Now we have Madeleine Albright, the new
Secretary of State, who has turned out to be also of Jewish origin and whose
views are probably the most extreme of the three. It remains to be seen
whether she will be taking over any major portion of the Middle East policy-setting
responsibilities previously exercised almost exclusively by Dennis Ross.
Also it is likely that Martin Indyk might be brought back from Tel Aviv
to take up a new post as Assistant Secretary of State, probably with Middle
East responsibilities.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Defending Our Honour</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Lena Winfrey Sayyed</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	America, Europe, Middle Eastern and other countries need
to reevaluate the friendliness and treaties they have with Israel in light
of how the Israelis have recently insulted their religions.  How can you
be friends with someone who ridicules your religion?  Doesn't it make you
angry?  Where's our sense of honor for the love of God?  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Recently in the West Bank city of Hebron, the Jewish soldiers
have closed the city and they and the Jewish settlers have not only been
fighting the Palestinians, but also they have issued leaflets to insult
both Islam and Christianity.  One was of a pig wearing a hata (scarf-like
hat) with the name &quot;Muhammad&quot; written under it, and it is sitting
across a book representing the Qur'an. They also took the representation
of Mary, the Mother of Jesus, and placed her head onto the body of a cow.
 Then, they entered a building and ripped up copies of the Qur'an as well
as painting insulting graffiti on the city's walls.  Not only Palestinians
should be angry, but also every Muslim and Christian throughout the whole
world.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Muslims received a double-slap because we also respect
the Virgin Mary.  Muslims consider her one of the five most pious and best
women to have ever lived.  Muslims also highly respect Jesus.  One chapter
in the Qur'an is named &quot;Maryam&quot;.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The  Qur'an  says  about Mary:   &quot;And (remember) her
(Mary) who guarded her chastity:  We breathed into her of Our spirit, and
We made her and her son a sign for all peoples&quot; (21:91).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Qur'an also says:  &quot;And Mary the daughter of
 'Imran, who guarded her chastity; and We breathed into (her body) of Our
spirit; and she testified to the truth of the words of her Lord and of his
Revelations, and was one of the devout (servants)&quot; (66:12).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Qur'an says of Jesus that when he was a baby he spoke
from the cradle to defend his mother and he said:  &quot;I am indeed a servant
of Allah,  He hath given me Revelation and made me a prophet&quot; (19:30).
 The Qur'an also tells us that Jesus cured the blind and lepers through
Allah's help and Allah's power as a sign to the people. Christians should
see that Muslims share a commonality with them.  Both Muslims and Christians
are supposed to be lovers of righteousness and morality.  We must work together
to protect our honor.  The Qur'an goes on to say that Jesus' followers would
have compassion and mercy in their hearts (57:27).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The Muslims and the Christians share qualities of compassion
and mercy. What about the Israelis?  One has to wonder where their mercy
and compassion for human lives are.  In  Palestine, the Israeli soldiers
and settlers have inflicted so many tortures and inhumane acts upon the
Palestinian population, even against UN resolutions.  If UN resolutions
are left unheeded, then who will stop the injustices?   The religion Allah
sent the Jews (in the Torah) told them to have compassion and to help people,
but the Israelis seem to have rejected Allah's covenant in light of the
situation in Palestine.  If they don't respect other people's religions,
then what about their own?     </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	  Many Israelis migrated from Eastern Europe or Russia,
where they were under Communist rule, and they were taught not to believe
in God.  So, when they went to Israel how have they fit in with others who
believe in God?  Well, they seem to ridicule all religions, and it must
have been easy for them to ridicule the religions of the people they hate--the
Palestinians.   Some of these settlers rely exclusively on their Zionist
creed to lead their lives.  This creed is dangerous because it is exclusive
and racist.  Golda Meir, former prime minister of Israel, stated once that
&quot;One Jewish fingernail is worth more than four million Arabs.&quot;
 With this kind of thinking, how can there ever be peace in this region?
         </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Where has the peace process flown away to?  It has become
mist and may never be recaptured.  These games must stop.  If the Israelis
truly wanted peace, then why are they trying to start a war?  They have
broken the peace treaty.  How can they be trusted again?    </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Muslims and Christians need to watch carefully to see
what the Israeli state will do next.  We must protect ourselves and our
honor.  Allah said in the Qur'an, &quot;Nearest among them in love to the
Believers (Muslims) wilt thou find those who say, &quot;We are Christians&quot;
: because amongst these are men devoted to learning and men who have renounced
the world and they are not arrogant&quot;  (5:85).  Muslims and Christians
must remain trustful of one another and see our common bonds.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The whole world must rethink its support for Israel. 
How can we support injustice and the mockers of our religions?  Now, in
Hebron, the Israelis are aiming at people's heads when they shoot.  They
are using bullets that explode in the body.  How can the world sit by and
watch this happen?  Especially, a world of Muslims and Christians who consider
themselves believers in God?  Believers in God love righteousness, justice,
and truth, and they are against oppression, cruelty and torture.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	I beseech  all Muslims and Christians, men and women,
to do all they can in the fight for Allah's cause--- for justice.  We need
to defend our religions and our honor.  We need to establish justice.  We
need to make jihad (struggle) in all possible ways:  speeches, letters,
writing, or combat.  If all peaceful means fail, then all that is left is
combat.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Oh, fellow Muslims, jihad is not a thing of the past.
 Allah has issued it until the Day of Judgment.  The one who struggles for
Allah gets the greatest reward.  We can only be successful if we obey Allah.
 Allah states in the  Qur'an:  &quot;Fight in the cause of Allah those who
fight you, but do not transgress limits; for Allah loveth not transgressors.
 And slay them wherever ye catch them, and turn them out from where they
have turned you out; for tumult and oppression are worse than slaughter;
but fight them not at the Sacred Mosque, unless they (first) fight you there;
but if they fight you,  slay them.  Such is the reward of those who suppress
faith.  But if they cease, Allah is oft-forgiving, Most Merciful.  And fight
them on until there is no more tumult or oppression, and there prevail justice
and faith in Allah; but if they cease, let there  be no hostility except
to those who practise oppression&quot; (2: 190--193).  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	So, fighting still must remain an option.  Allah has made
it a duty to defend ourselves and our religion.  If peaceful means fail,
then we may have to fight.  Sometimes to put justice in place, one must
use force so the other side will desist.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	When the Israelis insult our religions, they are not only
insulting us, but also our prophets and Allah.  How can we allow them to
insult Allah and do nothing?  If they feared us, they would not do so. 
Most of all, if they feared and believed in God then they would not insult
Him.  Let us ponder this point as our leaders  cater to all Israeli demands
without making any of our own conditions to stop the injustices as well
as when they  treat them as their kindred.   They should be cautious of
their &quot;relations.&quot;  </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Last Request</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By E.Yaghi</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nadene didn't look like a heroine.  She didn't even look
like she possessed  strong personality.  She hadn't much courage nor did
she own a drop of malice.  She was slight of figure and her hazel eyes were
enchanting and soothing, her face comforting and attractive.  But she certainly
did not fit the role of a typical heroine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What makes then, a man, woman, or even a child a hero?
 True, at that certain moment that demands courage, adrenaline is pumped
into the bloodstream in increased amounts, pushing a person to the limits
of physical and/or mental capacity.  But what sort of outside factors force
an ordinary kind of person to dare the impossible?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As a young girl, Nadene had been timid and gentle.  Her
older brothers exercised their authority over her and she accepted any abuses
with only a</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>shrug or smile and went about her work.  She was compassionate
to her younger brothers and sisters and was never known to speak a cruel
work to anyone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The obedient daughter and sister went on to become an obedient
wife and had four handsome boys who symbolized her purpose of existence.
 Her sons grew older and then the Intifada began.  One black night, Nadene's
husband left without a word of good-bye and stole away to join a guerrilla
group. Later, Nadene rec- eived word that he had been captured and was enchained
in a dreaded underground Israeli prison.  She never heard from him again
and spent many silent nights fretting and wondering if he was even alive.
She was forced to face life without a husband a father to guide her growing
boys. To add to her heavy burden, two of her younger sons were killed by
rubber bullets as they threw rocks at heavily armed Israeli soldiers.  She
now had only two out of her five males left.  The meaning of courage had
become branded in her heart.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One day, while she was sitting in her parents' house with
her father, she said, &quot;Papa, do you remember the time during an Israeli
search when I was, so afraid of the soldiers that I hid in the chicken coop?&quot;
 She smiled faintly and waited for his reaction.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Yes, how could I forget, you were still a teenager
then and tried to cram yourself into a place that a  smaller child would
not have thought of fitting into.  No one would have believed it possible
that you could be there, but when we went looking for you, that's where
we found you.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He broke out in laughter and his gray eyes twinkled.  She
bathed in his mirth and for a few minutes they both forgot the present.
 But soon she remembered her missing husband and her two dead sons and her
laughter died too.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Her father's warm eyes seemed to look deep into hers and
penetrate her heart to comprehend her feelings.  &quot;Nadene, why don't
you stay with us for a while? It would do you good.  We'd love to have you
and the boys with us for a change.  You look so thin, so empty.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  Her countenance grew pensive and she searched his eyes
for reassurance and replied, &quot;Perhaps, I will, Papa. Yes, I think that's
a good idea.  Maybe you could convince your grandsons to stay off the street
and give me a break.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She returned to her home and packed some belongings, gathered
her two sons and returned to her father's house where she found temporary
peace and contentment. She began to wonder how she could bear to go back
to her desolate house.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A week passed.  Nadene sat in the kitchen with her  mother.
 They were both stuffing zucchini when Lathe, the younger of her two surviving
sons stumbled into the doorway. Blood streamed out of his nose and his head
was badly bruised. His eyes were almost swollen shut.  Nadene gasped when
she saw him and her stomach turned.  Her heart beat with painful throbs.
 Her body shook and she grew hysterical.  Lathe pleaded with, &quot;Mother,
it's nothing!  I'm all right but the Israelis took Hussein!&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nadene's scream punctured the air.  Great tears rolled
down her stricken face and she became paralyzed with fear.  Her elderly
mother grabbed the boy's arm and sat him down.  She went to get some cotton
and alcohol to clean his wounds.  She didn't hear her mother's comforting
words, &quot;You'll be OK soon.  You'll have some more scars to add to those
you already have.  Something else to brag about to your friends.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>His mother's face remained frozen and unresponsive as the
grandmother continued, &quot;I'll send for a doctor to come and see  your
mother.  I think she's in shock.  Tell me about your brother Hussein. What
happened to him?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;We were burning some tires and throwing rocks at
the troops. Then a soldier caught me and started beating me with his rifle
butt and kicked me hard with his boots.  He hit me so much I stopped knowing
what was going on, but some of the Shebab came after him with Hussein and
he let go of me. I ran away with my rescuers and each of us hid in a different
house.  They didn't find me, but later some of the guys with us said that
the soldiers found Hussein and took him prisoner. They last saw him in a
police van. When it was safe, I came back here.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nadene's tears continued to roll down her pale cheeks,
but her eyes saw nothing and she responded to no one. The doctor came and
gave her frozen form a sedative and at last she slept fitfully.  Not much
later, she  got up, moaned and ranted and began to pace back and forth like
a caged animal. As daylight slowly formed, she returned to a statue-like
state.  For days, no word came concerning her son.  Her  eyes grew hollow.
 Her thin body grew thinner and she became like a wild lioness whose cub
was endangered. She couldn't look at Lathe's swollen eyes and bruised body.
 Anger glinted in her eyes replacing the softness that once had shone there.
 A harsh mask covered her benevolent face and her lips tautened into thin
lines.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At last, one cold winter morning, she put on her only thobe
and a faded decorated head covering and slipped out of her father's house.
 Purple storm clouds gathered over her village and strong winds seemed to
push them to some other destination. A white pigeon beat the sky with the
pumping of its wings on a solo flight.  A hawk swept the area searching
for food and the white pigeon disappeared in fright.  The air was misty
and apparently empathized with the mist in Nadene's eyes.  She swallowed
an icy breath, set her head straight and briskly walked down the dusty street.
Eventually, she caught sight of her target.  She touched the cold sharp
metal huddled insider her thobe and moved on hypnotically.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>She focused on her target of three soldiers who stood non-chalantly
talking</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>and laughing. They had noticed her but she wasn't a threat.
 Their backs were turned as they searched the street for trouble. Quietly,
as a cat ready to stalk its prey, she stole up behind the armed men, tearing
her dagger from its place and quickly plunged it into the back of one soldier.
 He yelled.  With an unknown strength, she withdrew the dagger and struck
the soldier beside him before he could really grasp what was happening.
 The blood of the two soldiers penetrated their uniforms and they fell to
the ground while the frantic woman approached yet the third soldier who
fought her daggered hand. A shot rang through the confusion and struck the
crazed woman in her head.  She collapsed in death.  Her crimson dagger quivered
and lay beside her in stunned silence.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Somehow Nadene had reached down and found the courage she
never had to have to strike out as few would dare.  The gentle doe who was
maddened by the deaths of her menfolk and the imprisonment of her son and
husband, ceased to suffer.  She was buried a martyr in her blood-soaked
clothing.  Now she lives a new free life for martyrs never die but live
forever somewhere where there is no fear, hate or evil.  Somewhere over
the rainbow in the land of Heaven.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>When Nadene died, she ascended to heaven and appeared as
a torch and met her  Great Creator and stood under his throne.  She was
asked, &quot;What is your last request?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nadene answered, I have no request. I am satisfied with
what I have.&quot; She was asked a second and third time the same question
so Nadene bravely replied as a true heroine, &quot;My only and last request
is to go back to earth and fight and die again so I can be a martyr again
and again!&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> A Christian Perception of Islam*</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Struggle For Dialogue And  Peace  </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Muslims are called by the Qura'an and the example of the
Prophet of Islam to strive for peace through all available means. The very
terms &quot;Islam&quot; derives from the root word whose basic meaning is
&quot;peace.&quot; This concept of peace defines the world view of Islam,
but more importantly it permeates the daily lives of Muslims. Thus each
time two Muslims meet, they greet each other with the words &quot;Assalamu
Alaikum&quot; &quot;peace be on you,&quot; and &quot;Wa-alaikumu-salam&quot;
&quot;peace be on you (also).&quot; The idea to be at peace with God, oneself,
our fellow human beings and the world of nature is the Islamic way of life.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Qura'anic terms, peace does not only mean &quot;absence
of war&quot;, rather it is a positive state of security in which one is
free from anxiety or fear. It is a state that entails both submission or
&quot;self surrender to God&quot; (Islam) and the &quot;true faith in God&quot;
(Iman). References are made to this concept, directly or indirectly, on
every page of the Qura'an through the many derivatives of the root S-L-M
and A-M-N from which Islam and Iman are derived respectively. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Peace&quot; is also an integral part of two of Allah's
names As-Salam and Al Mumin mentioned in the Qura'an. According to the Holy
Qura'an peace on earth (which is the precondition of peace in heaven) is
 the result of living according to the will of God. The Qura'anic ideal
is not easy to achieve in the world we live in because it entails not simply
the desire to end violence and war as means of conflict-resolution, but
rather the commitment of  &quot;doing what God approves.&quot; However,
from the Qura'anic perspective, achieving peace either here and now or in
the hereafter is not meant to be easy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Jihad</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Peace is dependent upon Jihad Fi Sabil-Lah, or striving
in the cause of God. It is most unfortunate that Jihad, which is the means
whereby God's vision of a peaceful world can come to be, is often identified
in the mind of many Muslims and non-Muslims with mere destruction. Jihad
is often translated as &quot;holy war,&quot; a characterization which does
not however fully or deeply reflect the essence of the term. In my understanding
the concept of Jihad is more meaningfully translated as &quot;holy peace.&quot;
the word Jihad comes from the verbal noun of the Arabic verb Jahada, meaning
&quot;to endeavor,&quot; &quot;to strive&quot; or &quot;to struggle.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a religious context, it can mean to struggle against
one's evil inclination or toward the moral uplift of society or for the
spread of Islam. Islam can be spread peacefully with the &quot;Jihad of
the pen,&quot;  according to Surah 16-125 of the Qura'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Call thou to the way of the Lord with wisdom and
admonition, and dispute with them in the better  way.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But the use of force is also possible namely with the &quot;Jihad
of the sword&quot; according to the Surah 2:193 of the Qura'an.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;And fight them on until there is no more tumult or
oppression, and there prevail justice and faith in God, but if they cease,
let there be no hostility except to those who practice oppression.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Holy Peace</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unfortunately, this possibility of Jihad through the use
of &quot;sword&quot; has been overemphasized by Muslims for political and
material reasons, and by non-Muslims in order to generate a feeling of revulsion
against Muslims for their own interests, which are far from religious in
nature.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Both Muslims and non-Muslims easily forget the meaning
of Jihad as the struggle against one's evil inclinations and as one's efforts
towards the moral uplifting of society. Among pious Muslims and mystics,
it is spiritual and moral Jihad which is emphasized. This is called greater
Jihad in comparative terms, in relation to the lesser Jihad,  the more popular
concept of Jihad, which is the &quot;Holy War,&quot; as stated in the following
tradition (Haidth&quot; of the Prophet Muhammed:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Once, having returned from one of his campaigns,
the Prophet said: 'We have now returned from the lesser Jihad' &quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The tradition adds that the companions asked: &quot;What
is the greater Jihad?&quot; and the Prophet answered: &quot;The struggle
against one's evil inclination.&quot; This is the deeper and more personal
aspect of Jihad,  which by its very is an inner struggle for &quot;holy
peace,&quot; as opposed to the outer physical struggle for &quot;holy war.&quot;
To attain real peace one first must undergo a a real struggle that begins
from within.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Dialogue</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On this level, dialogue can be a channel of peace if it
encourages an internal struggle that purifies the hearts of men and women,
preparing the spirit for the great dialogue with God, oneself and with people.
This great dialogue cannot be possible without a great struggle. Through
this process, we may achieve the &quot;great conversion&quot; of the heart.
This is not related to the conversion from one's religion to another, but
to the conversion of ourselves to God. As Rumi, one of the great sufi poets
of Islam stated:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jihad can only be waged by constant waging of the greater
Jihad; without spiritual, ethical content, the jihad becomes an instrument
for ego and rebellious masquerading in the hypocritical soul as fighters
for the sake of God.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This emphasis on the spiritual aspect of Jihad is part
of our continuous effort to read in Islam and Christianity elements of relevance
to a deeper dialogue between Muslims and Christians. According to the Qura'an,
Muslims have the right to defend themselves against injustice and the duty
to protect the weak from injustice (Sura 2:190-193; 217-; 4:75-78; 22:39-40)
But they are reminded over and over again that the &quot;limits said by
God&quot; (Hudud Allah) are not to be transgressed  at any time, and that
injustice must be accorded to the enemy. Furthermore, any initiative toward
peace taken by an enemy must be accepted and responded to in good faith
and with good  will.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The religion of Islam and Christianity teach moral fortitude
and enjoin each member to exercise justice. It is within this commandment
that Jihad or &quot;holy war&quot; has to be understood under the present
circumstances.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Like predecessor, successor Anan dared to
speak</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruba Farkh</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     It was a vote of 131 countries in favour, 3 countries
against (including the U.S. and Israel) and 14 abstained regarding the resolution
taken by the United Nations General Assembly urging the International Community
to work effectively so as to stop the construction of Jewish settlements
in the occupied territories, and requesting that Israel provide information
about the goods being produced and manufactured in those illegal settlements,
in an attempt, so it seems, to boycott those goods in the future.  The resolution
also condemned Israeli actions since it did not meet the 25 April General
Assembly extraordinary session's demands which required the full cessation
of the construction of a new settlement in Jebal Abu Ghneim and all other
illegal Israeli actions in Occupied East Jerusalem and the rest of the occupied
territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The resolution was mild in tone, compared to the draft,
and contained no sanctions whatsoever so as to attract as many votes as
possible.  While Israel condemned the resolution, the Arab states, not happy
with the lack of sanctions, said at least it exposed Israeli actions to
the world just as much as the report submitted to the General Assembly by
the U.N. Secretary-General Mr. Kofi Anan which showed that Israel has not
stopped building a new settlement at Jebal Abu Ghneim in East Jerusalem
despite </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>the Assembly's previous demand. The report also stated
that the settlement construction had a negative political, economic, demographic
and geographic impact and had caused harm to the Middle East peace process.
Further, Israel had revoked the residency rights of hundreds of Palestinian
Jerusalemites in 1997 leaving them with the status of &quot;resident immigrants&quot;
and subjecting them to discriminatory immigration controls.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     While referring to the Israeli Prime Minister's promise
(given at the same time as construction at Jebal Abu Ghneim proceeded) to
build 3,500 housing units for Palestinians in East Jerusalem, the report
said &quot;those housing units were not to be built at Jebal Abu Ghneim
but in 10 as-yet unspecified neighbourhoods in the Arab East Jerusalem.
Further, it was also not clear whether the housing units would be government-funded,
or if only building permits would be issued.&quot;  As for the construction
of settlements, the report went on to say that &quot;expansion activities
were recorded in more than 30 existing settlement areas.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     As for the realization of the principle of territorial
integrity, as stated in the Oslo Accords, this principle has been frustrated
by Israeli restrictions on the movements of persons and goods between the
so-called A, B and C areas of the West Bank and the Gaza Strip and between
the occupied territories and the outside world.  Moreover, safe passage
arrangements have not been established, and arrangements for  Gaza seaport
and airport have not been agreed upon, the report stated. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Since the Israeli policy of general closure, which
has been in effect since 30 March 1993, imposes explicit restrictions on
the mobility of goods and persons, the general closure has been accompanied
by periodic comprehensive closures.  The report also recorded the continued
administrative detention of almost 300 Palestinians in Israeli jails, held
without charge or trial. Palestinian detainees in Israeli custody continue
to be subjected to torture and other ill-treatment under security regulations
officially endorsed by the  Israeli Supreme Court and the government. It
also mentioned that Israeli demolitions of Palestinian houses in Jerusalem
and other parts of the occupied territories has continued. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     While the report does serve as a valuable document
providing proof of Israel's illegal activity, especially with regard to
Jerusalem, it brings back to one's mind the report submitted by the previous
U.N. Secretary-General Dr. Boutros Ghali on the event of the Israeli bombing
last year in Qana, south of Lebanon, wherein dozens of civilians were killed
and many more injured, including many U.N. peacekeeping troops, since the
Israeli military operation &quot;The Grapes of Wrath&quot; attacked a U.N.
base where civilians took shelter. The report blamed Israel and held her
fully responsible for the attack. This report was one of the reasons that
made Ghali the exception to the rule, since all U.N. Secretary-Generals
served two consecutive terms. Dr. Ghali was replaced by Mr. Anan. Now the
question that remains is will this report be Anan's mistake that will cause
him to lose a second term in his post or will the promised administrative
reforms cover up for him?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The village stood on a slightly elevated hill on the south-western
edge of the Marj ibn 'Amir Plain, on the two banks of Wadi al-Lajjun. Jinin
as well as the plain were visible from al-Lajjun. It was bordered on the
west and south by the Carmel Mountains [Kanaina and Mahamid 1987:44], by
Tall al-Mutasallim (to the northeast), and by Tall al-Asmar (to the northwest).
The village, which was linked by secondary roads to a highway between Jinin
and Haifa and to another highway that led southwest to the town of Umm al-Fahm,
lay close to the junction of the two highways.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	After the Bar-Kochba Revolt had been suppressed in A.D.
130 the Roman emperor Hadrian ordered a second Roman legion, the Legio VI
Ferrata (&quot;Ironsides&quot;), to be stationed in the north of the country.
The place where it established its camp was known as Legio. When in the
third century the army was removed, Legio became a city and its name was
augmented with the adjectival Masimianupolis. This remained its name throughout
the Byzantine period. It came under Arab control in the seventh century
A.D. during the early days of the Islamic conquest. Al-Lajjun was the site
of more than one military confrontation between Muslim factions, such as
the one in A.D. 945 between the Hamdanids of Aleppo and the Ikhshidids of
Egypt in which the renowned Sayf al-Dawla al-Hamadani was defeated. [D 3/2:164-71]
Al-Lajjun was captured by the Crusaders but was taken back by Salah al-Din
al-Ayyubi (Saladin) in 1187.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A number of Arab chroniclers and geographers mentioned
al-Lajjun over the years, including Ibn al-Faqih (writing in A.D. 903),
al-Maqdisi (writing in ca. A.D. 985), and Yaqut al-Hamawi (d. 1228). Al-Maqdisi
described it as a pleasant town on the edge of Palestine (when the boundaries
between Syria and Palestine were different from the present borders) and
mentioned its sources of fresh water. Al-Maqdisi and al-Hamawi (in his Mu'jam)
reported the presence of what the people of al-Lajjun called the mosque
of Abraham, built over a round rock. But whereas Ibn al-Faqih said that
the mosque lay outside al-Lajjun, al-Hamawi reported that it was in the
center of the town. [Cited in al-Khalidi 1968:193-94 and in Le Strange 1965:492-93]
A number of Muslim kings and prominent persons passed through the village,
including al-Kamil, the sixth Ayyubid ruler, who there gave his daughter
'Ashura' in marriage to his nephew in 1231. The village was also the burial
site of two Muslim scholars, Ali al-Shafi'i (d. 1310) and 'Ali ibn al- Jalal
(d. 1400). [D 3/2:164-711]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In 1596, al-Lajjun was a village in the nahiya of Sha'ra
(liwa' of Lajjun), with a population of 226. It paid taxes on a number of
crops, including wheat and barley, as well as on other types of property,
such as goats, beehives, and water buffalos. [Hut. and Abd.:159] Zahir al-'Umar,
who became the effective ruler of northern Palestine for a short period
during the second half of the eighteenth century, was reported to have used
cannons against al-Lajjun in the course of his campaign (1771-73) to capture
Nablus. [Abu Dayya 1986:51 ] It is unclear whether this attack led to the
village's decline in the years that followed; when the British consul for
Jerusalem and Palestine (1846-62), James Finn, visited the area, he did
not see a village on the site. [Finn 1868:229-30] The authors of the Survey
of Western Palestine noticed a khan, however, to the south of the ruins
of al-Lajjun in the early 1880s. [SWP (1881) 11:64-66]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> In the late nineteenth century, villagers from Umm al-Fahm
moved to the site of al-Lajjun to make use of its farmland. Gradually, they
settled in the village, building their houses around the springs, especially
next to the khan. When the massive mound at nearby Tall al-Mutasallim (ancient
Megiddo) was excavated by German archaeologists in 1903, some of the inhabitants
of al-Lajjun reused stones from the ancient structures that had been unearthed
to build new housing. [Fisher 1929:18] More people moved to al-Lajjun from
Umm al-Fahm during the British Mandate, and particularly in the late thirties,
due to the British government's persecution of the population for their
activities in the 1936-39 revolt that had spread throughout Palestine. Al-Lajjun's
economy grew rapidly as a result of the influx of additional population.
[Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:7-9]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	As the village expanded it was divided into three quarters,
one to the east, one to the west, and another known as Khirbat al-Khan.
Each quarter was inhabited by one or more hamulas (clans): the al-Mahajina
al-Tahta and al-Ghubariyya clans, the al-Jabbarin and al-Mahamid clans,
and the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa clan. [Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:44] In 1931
the population consisted of 829 Muslirns, 26 Christians, and 2 Jews; there
is no exact breakdown for the year 1945. In 1943 one of the large landowners
in the village financed the construction of a mosque, built of white stone,
in the al-Ghubariyya (eastern) quarter. Another mosque was also established
in the al-Mahamid quarter during the same period, and was financed by the
residents of the quarter themselves. [Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:44,45] Al-Lajjun
also had a school that was founded in 1937 and that had an enrollment of
83 in 1944. It was located in the quarter belonging to the al-Mahajina al-Fawqa
clan, that is, in Khirbat al-Khan. [Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:50]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	There was a small market place in the village, as well
as six grain mills (powered by the numerous springs and wadis in the vicinity),
and a health center. [Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:44] The various quarters
of al-Lajjun had many shops. A bus company was established in al-Lajjun
by a villager from Umm al-Fahm; the bus line served Umm al-Fahm, Haifa,
and a number of villages, such as Zir'in. In 1937 the line had seven buses.
Subsequently the company was licensed to serve Jinin also, and acquired
the name of al-Lajjun Bus Company. [Kana'na and Mahamid 1987:48-49] The
villagers cultivated grain, vegetables, and citrus fruits. al-Lajjun's archaeological
heritage has totally disappeared with little record and no excavation. Most
ruins have been bulldozed into a heap to allow planting on the fields.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	The official Israeli account states that al-Lajjun was
occupied shortly before I June 1948, following the &quot;clearing&quot;
of the Baysan Valley and prior to the (unsuccessful) Israeli attack on Jinin.
At that time, the Golani Brigade captured a number of villages in the vicinity
of Jinin, including al-Lajjun, which was entered at dawn on 30 May, according
to a press report in the New York Times. Several Israeli columns moved towards
the Triangle area at this time, taking a cluster of villages north of Jinin.
It is possible that the Golani's Fourth Battalion expelled the villagers
directly, in keeping with their practice during their previous operation
in the Baysan Valley.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Earlier New York Times reports had stated that the village
was first attacked and captured in mid-April, during the battle around the
settlement of Mishmar ha-'Emeq (see Abu Shusha, Haifa District). The commander
of the Arab Liberation Army (ALA) also reported an assault on 13 April,
when Jewish forces attempted &quot;to reach the crossroads at Lajjun in
an outflanking operation.&quot; The attack apparently failed. The Times
said that twelve people were killed and fifteen wounded during that offensive.
The paper also said that al-Lajjun was occupied a few days later, on 17
April, twelve days after the attack on Mishmar ha-'Emeq had been launched
from that village. The account read: &quot;Lajjun is the most important
place taken by the Jews, whose offensive has carried them through ten villages
south and east of Mishmar Ha'emek.&quot; The report added that women and
children had been removed from the village and that 27 buildings were blown
up by the Haganah in al-Lajjun and other villages nearby.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	But Arab military sources imply that the village was not
occupied at that time, for ALA commander Fawzi al-Qawuqji states that attacks
resumed the following month, on 6 May, when ALA positions in the area of
al-Lajjun were attacked by Haganah forces. The ALA's Yarmuk Battalion and
other units drove the attackers back, but two days later, the ALA commander
reported that Haganah forces were &quot;trying to cut off the Lajjun area
from Tulkarm in preparation for seizing Lajjun and Jenin....&quot; In summing
up the military situation in Palestine on 8 May, al-Qawuqji reported &quot;great
activity&quot; and &quot;fully equipped and armed lHaganah] concentrations
north of Jenin&quot; and &quot;heavy fighting in the 'Ara district,&quot;
i.e., some 12 km southwest of al-Lajjun. It is not clear whether the village
of al-Lajjun had come under Haganah control by this time or whether it held
out for about three more weeks, as the History of the War of Independence
states.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	During the second truce, in early September, a United
Nations official fixed the permanent truce line in the area at al-Lajjun,
according to press reports. A 500-yard area was established on both sides
of the line in which Arabs and Jews were allowed to harvest crops. [NYT:15/4/48,
18/4/48, 31/5/48, 1/6/48, 7/ 9148; Q:6-9, 15, 44; T:179]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT>&nbsp;</P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	In 1949 Israel established the settlement of Yosef Kaplan,
which was later renamed Kibbutz Megiddo (167220), about 0.5 km to the northeast
of the village site. At the time of its construction the traditional landholdings
of a chain of Palestinian villages, stretching between the town of Umm al-Fahm
and al-Lajjun, had been amalgamated to form a large bloc. The settlement's
proximity to al-Lajjun suggests that it was built on land that had once
belonged to al-Lajjun, but this land may have belonged to a neighboring
village in earlier times.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Only the white stone mosque, one village mill, the village
health center, and a few partially destroyed houses remain on the site.
The mosque has been converted into a carpentry workshop and one of the houses
has been made into a chicken coop. The health center and grain mill are
deserted, and the school is gone. The cemetery remains, but it is in a neglected
state; the tomb of Yusuf al-Hamdan, a prominent nationalist who fell in
the 1936 revolt, is clearly visible. The surrounding lands are planted with
almond trees, wheat, and barley; they also contain animal sheds, a fodder
plant, and a pump installed on the spring of 'Ayn al-Haija. The site is
tighUy fenced in and entry is blocked.<BR>
