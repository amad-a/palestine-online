<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2> Terrorism Breeds Terrorism</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The 30 July suicidal bombing in West Jerusalem has once
again confronted  us with the reality of the enduring and essentially unresolved
conflict between Palestinian Arabs and Israeli Jews. Moreover, the bloodbath
seems to have exposed once again the utter and scandalous superficiality
of the &quot;peace process,&quot; which has so far failed miserably to provide
&quot;justice&quot; for Palestinians and &quot;security&quot; for Jews.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It often seems that one should not unduly busy himself
 with the secondary task of ascertaining the  identity of the perpetrators,
who, along with their victims, are now in the other world. Nor with placing
undue blame solely on Hamas, an essentially religio-cultural movement with
hundreds of thousands of followers and supporters in Palestine and further
millions of sympathizers all over the world.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For there are more important &quot;genuine&quot; questions
that must be addressed and answered, convincingly and courageously, to prevent
a repetition of the bloody scenes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is amply clear that the current Israeli government bears
much of the responsibility for creating the &quot;perfect environment&quot;
for &quot;suicidal bombers and bombings.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israel, one must have sufficient courage to point out ,
has been narrowing Palestinians' horizons by stealing their land on a daily
bases, desecrating their holy places, profaning their religious symbols,
and killing and mutilating hundreds of Palestinians with total impunity.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the last three months alone, as man as five hundred
Palestinians were riddled by Israeli live and rubber bullets in Hebron.
Five Palestinians were killed, one cold-bloodedly at an Israeli roadblock
outside Nablus on 28 July.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the Israeli government has effectively turned
its back on the peace process,  offering the Palestinians either capitulation
or eventual national extermination.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>East Jerusalem, a city of utmost importance to Muslims
and Christians,  has been subjected to a frenzied campaign of &quot;ethnic
cleansing,&quot; a step towards having an all-Jewish Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, thanks to the Israeli policy, the Palestinian
Authority has become virtually a pathetic version of the  Israeli puppet
militia in South Lebanon known as SLA.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hence, all Palestinian dreams of freedom and deliverance
 from Israeli shackles have effectively evaporated.  The Palestinian towns,
nominally under PA control, have become &quot;shut-in ghettoes&quot; where
 undercover Israeli soldiers roam freely in the full view of subdued and
powerless Palestinian policemen. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In short, the collective and individual life of the Palestinians
has become an enduring hell so much so that many people, and their number
is increasing steadily,  have come to lament the days of the &quot;direct
Israeli occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the face of an ugly, nightmarish reality,  one can hardly
behave idealistically, and in a world of wolves one has to be either a wolf
or a venomous, cunning snake in order to survive.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, when humanbeings are pushed to the borders of 
despair (and the Palestinians have been pushed to the edge of despair, thanks
to Israeli measures) they tend to behave unpredictably. The unpredictable
behavior here is not the cause; it is the effect.  One doesn't have to be
a great psychologist to understand that when people are bereft of hope,
when their horizons are narrowed, they easily become suicidal, because then
they have nothing to lose but &quot;torment and suffering.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Now, will the bombing be the last? Let no one delude himself
into believing that suicidal bombers and bombings would simply disappear
just because the world doesn't like them.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Only when the ethics of justice replace the ethics of &quot;power&quot;
can Israelis and Palestinians rid themselves of this cycle of &quot;terrorism
breeding terrorism.&quot; Only a genuine &quot;political act&quot; could
really put an end to Palestinian-Israeli bloodshed. Any other sought-after
alternatives would only perpetuate terrorism, the effect rather than the
cause.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Profane posters should sound alarm bells
for Muslims</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     On 28 June, two Jewish settlers pasted blasphemous
anti-Islamic posters on Arab storefronts in Hebron featuring a caricature
of the Prophet Muhammed (may peace be upon him) as a pig writing the Qur'an.
The despicable act, which understandably drew angry Muslim reactions all
over the world, was treated by the Israeli government as an  &quot;isolated
act&quot; and an &quot;anecdotal event.&quot; However, Israeli officials,
while ostensibly denouncing the act and branding it as &quot;incompatible
with Jewish traditions,&quot; turned a blind eye on the real issue that
bred the sacrilegious incident and truly made it a &quot;phenomenon&quot;
rather than an &quot;exception.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     It is amply clear that anti-Islamic (and anti-goyem)
thinking is rife among a sizeable segment of the Jewish community in Palestine,
the United States and some European countries.  The list of morbid Jewish
behaviour to that effect is too long to be reviewed in this brief sketch.
However, the following examples may illustrate our point.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     It is an established fact that Jewish film-makers,
who have a virtual monopoly over Hollywood, have repeatedly insulted Islam
and Christianity under the rubric of freedom of expression.  In decades
of tendentious pro-Israeli movies, Zionist producers never lost an opportunity
to malign Islam, the Prophet of Islam, the Holy Book of Islam and Muslims
at large.  In fact, Zionist films insulted Islam in every conceivable way,
beginning with starring dogs called &quot;Muhammed&quot; to making contextual
remarks such as &quot;Allah is on my ass.&quot; More to the point, Israeli
leaders on many occasions insulted the religion of Islam and its prophet,
Muhammed. In 1991, Israeli premier Yitshak Shamir said, while addressing
the Knesset or Israeli parliament, that &quot;Arabs were learning lies from
their Prophet.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     In Palestine, the settlers of Gush Emunim, who are
represented in the Knesset and government of Benyamin Netanyahu through
the National Religious Party (NRP), make no secret of their &quot;contempt
of Islam&quot; and more so of &quot;Christianity.&quot; Tearing up copies
of the Qur'an has always been a favourite practice by Jewish settlers in
many localities in the West Bank.  Ask any Arab kid in downtown Hebron and
he would tell you volumes of hair-raising accounts of anti-Islamic insults
perpetrated by the settlers under the watchful eyes of heavily armed Israeli
soldiers. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Anti-Islamic racism on the part of many Jews is not
a tentative, passing phenomenon. It is rather a way of thinking that is
deeply engraved in their upbringing and culture. Ask a settler kid how he
views Muslims and he would readily and nonchalantly tell you &quot;they
are dogs and pigs.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     This is very sad indeed because words can kill. Baruch
Goldstein, who murdered 29 Muslim worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque on
25 February 1994, was indoctrinated in the same anti-Islamic, anti-goyem
ideology that forms the collective morbid entity known as &quot;Jewish settlers.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     The problem does not stop at merely uttering injurious
words that might seem innocuous to distant outsiders; it actually goes much
further, because spiteful, virulent words could inspire and even encourage
bloodshed. It is a fact, as any psychologist would tell you, that vilification
and denomination usually precede genocide. The Jews themselves had had stark
lessons in this which should make them think many times before deciding
to walk in the footsteps of their former tormentors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>     Muslims, too, should be vigilant. It is often said
that the ultimate aim of Jewish settlers is the destruction of Al Masjidul
Aqsa and the building on its ruinous site of the Temple, the ultimate symbol
of Jewish redemption.  Hence the pasting of the blasphemous posters by settlers
in Hebron which could serve as a &quot;water-testing precedent&quot; to
a would-be crime that is much more colossal. Muslims, therefore, must not
take this possibility lightly because Jewish-Zionist insolence knows no
bounds.  The choice is simply one of life or death for the Muslim Umma.
Hence the paramount significance of Muslim reawakening.     <BR>
