<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon launches all-out war on the Palestinian
people </font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Prime Minister and certified war criminal Ariel Sharon has
apparently decided to launch an all-out war on the Palestinian intifada or uprising, now
entering its seventh month.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 30 March, and while Palestinians were commemorating the 25th
anniversary of &#147;Land Day&#148;, which symbolizes the Palestinians&#146; clinging to
their land in the face of unceasing Jewish efforts to wrest it from their hands, Sharon
ordered his occupation troops throughout the West Bank to resume the &#147;shoot-to-kill
policy&#148; against Palestinian protesters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Consequently, the Israeli army, using high-velocity bullets and
nerve-agent gases, which cause severe spasmodic reactions and often lead to an agonizing
death, killed at least six Palestinian youths and minors.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody suppression of Palestinian protests was especially ferocious in
three Palestinian towns: Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Nablus, at least 5 young demonstrators were killed and over 50 injured
when apparently trigger-happy Israeli troops stationed on hilltops overlooking the West
Bank&#146;s largest town opened fire on thousands of Palestinians who were marching to
protest continued Israeli torment and occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The shelling also targeted civilian neighbourhoods inside Nablus itself,
including the Amman and Jerusalem neighbourhoods as well as downtown. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of those killed, four were reportedly hit by gunfire in the head and neck,
apparently by lethal high-velocity ammunition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The martyrs are: Ayesh Zamel, 19, of the village of Deir al-Hatab village,
near Nablus, who was hit by a bullet in his left eye, going through his brain and exited
at the back of his head; Ahmad Marahil, a 16-year-old high school student, who was killed
while walking on al-Qods street, by a bullet in the neck, Murad Saleh Sharay&#146;a, 20,
and Sha&#146;aban Salloum, all three of whom are from the refugee camp Balata outside
Nablus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to hospital sources, the impact of the high-velocity bullets was
such that Murad Saleh Sharay&#146;a&#146;s head was smashed to pieces while Sha&#146;aban
Salloum had his head blown off. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khalid Abu Nahleh, 28, from the El-Ein refugee camp succumbed to his
wounds in hospital after being hit by gunfire in the back of his waist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Ramallah, when Palestinian demonstrators reached the northern entrance
of the town, Israeli soldiers fired at them without warning, using live ammunition and
rubber-coated steel bullets. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a result, 21-year-old Muhammed al-Wawi from the Ama&#146;ari refugee
camp was killed with a sniper&#146;s bullet in the head. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Over 20 others were injured, including Abu Ali Muqbul, 55, from Ramallah,
who sustained critical wounds in the pelvis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, clashes between stone-hurling Palestinian youths and heavily
armed Israeli occupation soldiers erupted again on 30 March along the so-called
&#147;friction line&#148; at Bab-el-Zawiya and Shalala Street. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hospital sources spoke of at least ten people hospitalized, including one,
Ihab al-Hashlamoun, who reportedly sustained serious gunshot wounds.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the afternoon, Israeli tanks and gunners pounded several civilian
neighbourhoods with artillery shells, inflicting widespread destruction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ferocious shelling continued for over four hours and continued well
into the night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Nazi-like Jewish settlers continued their week-old rampage
against unprotected Palestinian civilians throughout the old town of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said as may as 20 stores, houses and businesses were
torched by Jewish settlers, reportedly in the full view of Israeli occupation soldiers who
made no attempt to stop settler vandalism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, scores of settlers sought unsuccessfully to carry out a pogrom
against the Abu Sneineh neighbourhood opposite the centre of the old town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian defenders repulsed the settlers who retreated to their small
enclave in the old town, where the Israeli occupation army brought in three tanks and an
additional 3,000 troops ostensibly to launch a fresh onslaught on Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1948 Palestine, massive marches commemorating &#147;Land Day&#148; were
organized throughout Arab towns and villages from Akka and Sakhnin in the north to Rahat
and Beir al Sabb&#146;a in the south.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The largest march took place in Sakhnin, where the first Land Day
originated on 30 March 1976, when Israeli occupation soldiers opened fire on Palestinian
peasants protesting the confiscation of their land by Israeli authorities seeking to
expand Jewish settlements, killing six youths.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The conditions that existed 30 years ago are still very much the
same now; the Nazi Zionists are still trying to chase us out of our homeland. The seizure
of our land has not abated a bit,&#148; said one speaker.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arab Knesset member Abdul Malik Dahamashe, speaking at a rally in
Kufur-Kanna, stressed the unity of struggle and destiny between Palestinians at home and
in the Diaspora. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We reaffirm the umbilical attachment to the Palestinian people in
Palestine and in the Diaspora,&#148; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bloody events of &#147;Land Day&#148; followed an escalation of
Israeli aggression against the Palestinian people on 28 March when Israeli Appache
helicopter gunships struck several Palestinian targets, including power stations, in
Ramallah and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The blind bombardment resulted in the killing of three Palestinians,
including a 40-year-old mother, Suad Etiwi, who was killed in Bitunya near Ramallah while
seeking to move children to safety.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, on 27 March, a Palestinian boy named Mahmoud Ismael Darawish, age
11, was killed while eating supper inside his living room in the town of Dura.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deadly bullet was apparently fired by Israeli occupation soldiers
stationed on the opposite hilltops.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli media, which sought to exploit the accidental death of a
Jewish toddler in Hebron a day earlier, made no mention of the killing of Darawish.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Much of the Zionist escalation of violence against the Palestinians is
apparently attributed to a sort of &#147;green light&#148; which the Israeli war criminal
and Prime Minister Sharon received from U.S. President George W. Bush during his recent
visit to the United States.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 30 March, Bush tacitly blamed the Palestinians for the
&#147;violence.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The signal I&#146;m sending to the Palestinians is to stop the
violence and I can&#146;t make it anymore clear.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Bush ignored, almost completely, Israeli aggression against the
Palestinians, saying only that Israel should relax the siege on Palestinian population
centres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the outbreak of the Palestinian revolt against Zionist Nazism, more
than 450 Palestinians, mostly children and minors, were killed, and over 15,000 were
injured, many seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the same period, 73 Jewish soldiers and settlers were killed. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon seeks to create more &#147;facts&#148; in
the West Bank</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite claims to the contrary, the Sharon government has apparently
endorsed plans to create at least one large Jewish settlement south of Jerusalem and
significantly expand a number of existing settlements throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Hebrew press, the Israeli Housing Ministry has already
prepared plans for building a new Jewish settlement that would include 6,000 flats in an
area located between Bethlehem and Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new settlement, to be called Giva&#146;ot, would be inhabited by Jews
from the &#147;national-religious camp,&#148; considered among the most racist and
virulently anti-Arab of Jews anywhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If built, the new settlement would further truncate the southern part of
the West Bank, bisecting it into two main enclaves (Hebron and Bethlehem) cut off from
each other and lacking territorial continuity with the Ramallah region in the central West
Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the planned settlement, a Jerusalem municipal committee has
approved new plans to build another 3,000 apartments on confiscated Arab land at Jabal Abu
Ghneim, or &#147;Har Homa&#148; as referred to by the Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The governments of Benyamin Netanyahu and Ehud Barak had already
constructed hundreds of settler units at Jabal Abu Ghneim on Jerusalem&#146;s southern
suburbs, mainly for the purpose of completing the chain of Jewish settlements around
occupied East Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The political aim of this settlement, as was the case with other
settlements, is unmistakably clear, namely to make returning the town to the Palestinians
a remote or non-existent possibility.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, the grabbing of Palestinian land by armed Jewish settlers
continued unabated throughout the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources reported this week that Jewish settlers were seizing
Palestinian land in the vicinity of their settlements and cordoning it off with barbed
wire, with the Israeli army&#146;s tacit approval.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron, for example, the Israeli army last week confiscated a large
expanse of Palestinian farmland adjacent to the former armistice line of 1967.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The owners of the land, poor peasants from the nearby village of Beit
Kahel, organized a sit-in on the land on 26 March to protest the illegal seizure. However,
Israeli soldiers stationed at the site forcibly vacated the villagers, threatening to
shoot the them if they didn&#146;t disperse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli army bulldozers likewise were busy during the last week of March
pulverizing Palestinian vineyards and olive orchards south of the town of Dura, 10 miles
south-west of Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There the Israeli army is opening yet another bypass road that would link
the tiny settlement of Otnael, inhabited by no more than 30 settler families, with
inter-city roads in southern Israel more than 15 miles away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The opening of the road, and the accompanying brutality of destroying
verdant Palestinian fields on which villagers depend for their livelihood, underscores the
brutal ugliness of the Zionist mentality and the extent to which the Sharon regime is
willing to go to torment the Palestinians in order to appease a handful of North American
immigrants who view Palestinian life as expendable.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as the expansion of settlements continues, so do the often murderous
attacks of Jewish settlers against Palestinian civilians throughout the occupied
territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 March, the bludgeoned body of 44-year-old Jabri Abu Ras of Dura was
found dumped outside the Jewish settlement of Halmish north of Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian hospital sources in Ramallah said Abu Ras, a father of five,
was shot several times in the chest and head before his skull was crushed by stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His relatives affirmed that they had no doubt whatsoever that the settlers
committed the gruesome crime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 16 March, settlers from the settlement of Navi Yaccoub north of
Jerusalem reportedly murdered a 10-year-old Palestinian child who was playing soccer near
the settlement, using very much the same gruesome method of murder.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In both cases, the Israeli occupation authorities made no arrests among
the settlers nor even launched an investigation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, far from seriously investigating the two murders, an Israeli
police spokesman sought to divert attention from the true culprits, claiming that the
Palestinian Authority was behind the murders, an incredible claim scoffed at by
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from their murderous attacks which have come lately to assume a
daily frequency, the settlers continued to carry out wanton acts of vandalism against
Palestinian civilians often in the full view of Israeli army soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier this week, the Israeli human rights group B&#146;Tselem accused
the Israeli army of tolerating and tacitly encouraging settler violence against innocent
and unprotected Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report stressed that the settlers&#146; often wanton violence and
vandalism against Palestinians and their property &#147;occur against a background of
leniency and prolonged impotence of the Israeli law-enforcement authorities.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the report, the settlers&#146; violence took many forms,
including firing at Palestinian civilian neighbourhoods, killing and wounding Palestinian
civilians, firing and throwing stones at Palestinian cars, damaging property, uprooting
trees, burning a mosque, harming Palestinian medical teams, attacking journalists and
preventing farmers from reaching their fields.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The report mentioned two telling facts, which are known too well to the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, the fact that Israeli soldiers and police officers are often
present when settlers attack Palestinians but do absolutely nothing to stop or prevent the
attacks. Indeed, in many cases, the report said, the soldiers respond
&#147;derisively&#148; to Palestinian appeals for assistance against settler violence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Second, and this is very significant, the fact that settler violence
against the Palestinians is very often not investigated, with two thirds of the cases
being closed, ostensibly owing to &#147;lack of interest.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The plague of Jewish settlers is not confined to physical violence and
wanton rampage.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 26 March, as much as 3.5 million cubic metres of partially treated
sewage water originating at the Jewish settlement of Nahal Oz, east of Gaza, deluged
several Arab neighbourhoods in Gaza town, causing a huge environmental disaster.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The huge torrent reportedly occurred when an Israeli water storage
facility at the settlement broke down (or was deliberately broken down), causing the
deluge to inundate much of the Shujaiya neighbourhood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The flood reportedly caused incalculable damage to houses as well as to
farmland and livestock in the area.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian officials put the damage and losses incurred at tens of
millions of dollars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Palestinian official remarked on the incident, saying that the Jews
have introduced a new weapon against us.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Siege continues despite Sharon&#146;s PR</font></b><i></h3>
</i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b><strong> <i>From Khalid Amayreh</i></strong><br>
The stark dichotomy between Ariel Sharon&#146;s repetitious claims about relaxing
Israel&#146;s suffocating siege on Palestinian population centres and the reality on the
ground is still observed throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, any traveller in the West Bank these days will be affronted by the
fact that the nearly hermetic blockade of Palestinian towns, villages and even small
hamlets is still firmly in place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">True, a slight mitigation in the severity of the siege might occasionally
be observed here and there. But the basic structure of the siege remains intact and its
onerous effects are ubiquitous and felt by the entire population, as the Israeli army
continues to dissect the West Bank into small cantons, ghettos and closed areas, cut off
from each other and virtually isolated from the rest of the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Monday, 19 March, the Israeli army further tightened its blockade on
Bethlehem following the killing of an Israeli settler near the settlement of Navi Danial a
few miles south of the Arab town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel accused the Palestinian Authority of giving safe haven to the
perpetrators, vowing to retaliate harshly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Israeli sources, the occupation army postponed or refrained
from taking &#147;stronger retaliatory measures&#148; in order not to undermine Ariel
Sharon&#146;s visit to Washington.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some Palestinians interpreted the ambush as a retaliation for the
increasingly bold attacks by Jewish settlers against Palestinian civilians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 16 March, the Jerusalemite family and relatives of 10-year-old Muhammed
Nassar, whose bludgeoned body was found in the vicinity of the Jewish settlement of Navi
Yaccoub in occupied Arab East Jerusalem, accused Jewish settlers of murdering him in cold
blood.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The family said the boy went to play soccer at a playground near the
settlement but failed to return home.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I don&#146;t have the slightest doubt that they (the settlers) did
it; who else would commit a gruesome crime as such?&#148; said the boy&#146;s uncle Amin
Nassar.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The family scoffed at and vehemently denied Israeli insinuations that the
boy might have been the victim of a vendetta killing by other Arabs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They just want to divert attention from the settlers by all means;
our family has no feuds or problems with anyone; I found their insinuations to that effect
disgusting,&#148; said Nassar. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian economy on the brink of paralysis</b></u><br>
In the Gaza Strip, the Israeli army hasn&#146;t made things any easier for the estimated
1.3 million Palestinians, most of whom are languishing in abject poverty owing to the
siege and lost jobs inside Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For in addition to closing the roads and the continued truncation of the
area within which the Palestinians are free to move without being targeted by Israeli
bullets, the Israeli occupation army has effectively barred fuel imports to the Gaza
Strip, pushing the Strip&#146;s already ravaged survival economy to the brink of
paralysis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And to make things even worse, and despite Israeli public statements that
Palestinian fishermen would be permitted to fish off the Gaza coast, Israeli navy boats on
many occasions chased and fired live rounds of ammunition at the poor Gazan fishermen for
violating the ban on fishing. According to Palestinian sources, a number of fishermen have
been arrested and their boats were either seized or vandalized for entering &#147;a closed
military zone.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Draconian measures prove that recent Israeli claims and statements
about relaxing the siege on the Palestinians were only public relations announcements with
almost no substance and virtually no good will.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is at least the message most Palestinians are getting.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the third week in March, Palestinian intellectuals and artists
marched through Ramallah, demanding the lifting of the siege which they contend reflects
the ugly face of Israel&#146;s racism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The march was a novel and rather successful Palestinian experiment with
non-violent and passive resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The marchers, who included people of all ideological orientations, passed
by the onerous Israeli roadblocks, and instead of hurling stones at the well-entrenched
soldiers, they sang and chanted national anthems, glorifying freedom and denouncing
apartheid and oppression of men by their fellow men.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another non-violent march organized on Monday, 19 March, this time by the
Palestinian women&#146;s union, was harshly repressed by Israeli soldiers who fired
rubber-coated bullets, tear gas shells and stun-grenades at the women activists as they
sought to enter Jerusalem at the El-Ram roadblock, which the Israelis consider the border
point between Jerusalem (e.g. Israeli-controlled territory) and the self-rule areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As many as 20 protesters were injured and hospitalized, including
Palestinian law maker Hanan Ashrawi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two journalists were also injured, one Egyptian and the other Italian. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The harsh repression of the women activists&#146; march demonstrated that
the Israeli government and army will not change their ill-treatment of the Palestinians,
however non-violent and peaceful Palestinian protests against the Israeli occupation may
become.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the Israeli shoot-to-kill policy continued to be the standard
Israeli response to Palestinian protests, resulting in the killing of an average
Palestinian everyday.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Jewish settlers seem to have been emboldened by the ascendance
of Ariel Sharon to power in the Jewish State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition to the reported murder of the child Nassar on Friday, Jewish
settlers near Nablus attacked on 17 March two Arab cars, injuring six Palestinians,
including a woman who sustained serious wounds as here car plunged into a ravine after
settlers smacked a large rock on its windshield.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These and similar attacks by settlers on Palestinian civilians, including
acts of murder, are routinely ignored by the Israeli police on the ground that &#147;the
intifadah is a war launched by Palestinians against Israel and in war, excesses are
permitted and expected.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is believed that the settlers have been responsible directly or
indirectly for the often murderous killing of as many as 40 Palestinian civilians since
the outbreak of the uprising on 28 September.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Very few of them, if any, have been prosecuted or imprisoned for the
crimes committed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Hebron on 11 March, Jewish settlers celebrating a Jewish religious
holiday dressed up like Baruch Goldstein, the settler who in 1994 massacred 29
Palestinians praying in the Ibrahimi Mosque, and rampaged through Hebron&#146;s Old Town,
attacking Palestinians, vandalizing their property and shouting &#147;death to
Arabs.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers, some drunk and armed, also fired into the air, ostensibly in
a gesture of defiance to the 180,000 Palestinians who constitute the population of Hebron.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The settlers pelted pedestrians with stones and empty bottles in full view
Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian leaders in Hebron condemned the settlers&#146; wanton
behaviour, arguing that peace couldn&#146;t be restored to Hebron without removing the
settlers from the city.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few leftist Israeli politicians also denounced the Israeli army for
allowing settlers to act wantonly in Hebron and for re-imposing a curfew on the Old
Town&#146;s nearly 30,000 Palestinians in order to allow &#147;a handful of settlers to
have a good time.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Thousands of Palestinians are under curfew to allow a smattering of
settlers to dress up as Baruch Goldstein. It is immoral and will not assist in restoring
quiet to the city,&#148; commented Moshe Raz of the left-of-centre Meretz Party.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nonetheless, with Sharon, Zevi and Liberman now at the helm of power in
Israel, it is quite unlikely that Raz&#146;s statements will find much of an echo among
settlers or other Israelis. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA official Hisham Abdul Razek, who is in charge of the prisoners&#146;
portfolio in the PA administration, said the children were all under 17 and being interned
with Jewish criminal offenders, including rapists and drug addicts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Razek said in an interview with the Palestinian semi-official daily,
<i>Al-Ayyam</i>, that the children were also being beaten and continually harassed by
Israeli prison officials.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, the children smuggled out letters in which they complained of
continuous maltreatment at the hands of Israeli prison authorities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The children pointed out that imprisoned Jewish criminals often attack
them, using sharp objects, and seize their belongings and food.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Israeli occupation authorities in the West Bank and Gaza Strip
continued to bar family visits to political prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel is still holding as many as 2,000 Palestinian political prisoners
in its numerous jails and detention centres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, according to human rights organizations, the Israeli army has
rounded up hundreds of Palestinians since the outbreak of the Palestinian intifada nearly
six months ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most of the detainees are interned without charge or trial and are used as
bargaining chips to exert pressure on the Palestinian Authority to offer concessions in
return for their release. </p>

agricultural exports</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- The agricultural sector of the Zionist economy
has reportedly suffered huge losses stemming from a serious shortage of manpower.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli State-run radio reported during February that Israeli farmers
were forced recently to destroy over 30,000 tons of harvested agricultural produce, which
had been earmarked for transport to Europe and North America, because of a shortage of
harvesters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The radio estimated the losses to the agricultural sector emanating from
the absence of Palestinian workers owing to the intifada at hundreds of millions of
dollars.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the construction and tourism industries were even more
hard-hit as a result of the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli sources reported that tourism to the Zionist State was down by 50%
and that thousands of employees in the tourist industry were laid off as a consequence of
the unprecedented recession.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All in all, it is believed that Israeli losses in connection with the
intifada has so far topped 1,500 million U.S. dollars. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem </b>- A four-year-old Palestinian child succumbed to
his illness on 21 March after the Israeli occupation authorities refused to allow him to
travel to Egypt for medical treatment unavailable in the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources in Gaza said the child, Abdul Fattah Jouhar

heart disease known as Ebstein Anomaly.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel reportedly denied him treatment in Israeli hospitals owing to the
siege imposed on Palestinian population centres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The child&#146;s father testified that he went to Rafah crossing point
four times for the purpose of travelling to Egypt and that every time he was turned back
by the Israeli authorities at the border crossing.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza </b>- A Palestinian group calling itself the &#147;Free
Officers&#148; said that purging the land of Palestine necessitated ending corruption of
those elements that did not care for Palestinian pain and suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The group, in a statement distributed in the streets of Gaza, named
several Palestinian figures occupying official posts in the Palestinian Authority and
charged them with financial, moral and administrative corruption in addition to
opportunism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is believed that the group is comprised of several medium-ranked
officers within the PA security apparatuses who view with dismay the deteriorating
situation in the Palestinian society on various political, social, economic and moral
levels, holding the PA leadership responsible for such deterioration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement charged finance minister Mohammed Nashasheebi, director of
his ministry Saeed Oweida, sport under-secretary Ahmed Yazji and rector of Azhar
University&#150;Gaza Branch&#151;Riad al-Khudari of corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement, after mentioning names of a group of prostitutes who
corrupt the behaviour of Palestinian youth, said that it was important for everybody to
know their names.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement emphasized that those corrupt elements were more dangerous
than the occupiers. It charged those elements of child prostitution, which it said was
never practised by occupation, at a time when children&#146;s blood was being shed on a
daily basis in the intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same group had issued previous statements dealing with similar topics
but the PA never arrested any of the listed names.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza </b>- Dr. Mahmoud al-Zahhar, one of the senior officials in the Hamas
Movement, has criticized performance of the Palestinian Authority&#146;s television for
not coping with developments of the Aqsa Intifada.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said that the Zionist occupation troops tried to strangle the
Palestinian media through assaulting journalists and tried to link Palestinian news web
sites on the Internet to pornographic sites.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He affirmed, however, that the intifada had imposed itself on the
international media and hailed, in this respect, efforts of various reporters covering the
intifada activities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zahhar castigated the PA official television for being absent during
celebrations held in honour of the martyrs in addition to daily sufferings of Palestinians
as a result of the Zionist siege.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hamas leader castigated some Arab satellite channels for practising
normalization while others tried to drive a wedge among Palestinian factions through cheap
means.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He refuted the Arab media use of the term &#147;Israel&#148; when
referring to the Zionist entity, affirming that they should negate any recognition of that
entity in the minds of the Arab public opinion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zahhar&#146;s statements were made in an informational panel organized by
the engineers&#146; syndicate in Gaza under the title of the &#147;Israeli repression,
American offensive and the role of Palestinian media and Arab satellite channels in
confronting them.&#148;</p>
