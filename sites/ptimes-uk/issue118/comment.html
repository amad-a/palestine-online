<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Sharon&#146;s regional agenda</font></b></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear by now that Ariel Sharon remains faithful to his old
virulent views about the Palestinian question, the ultimate root-cause of instability and
insecurity in the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These views, needless to say, are manifestly racist and unmistakably
pugnacious and can be compared, with little exaggeration, with Hitler&#146;s approach
toward Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Sharon&#146;s behaviour since he was elected Prime Minister of
Israel on 6 February indicates that he is not the &#147;changed man&#148; Zionist
propagandists and apologists have claimed he has become.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Far from being a rehabilitated man, Sharon actually seems intent on
pursuing a policy of sabre-rattling, bellicosity and venomous incitement throughout the
region, all for the purpose of making the Zionist State both the police and master of the
Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We all saw recently how the &#147;hero&#148; of the Sabra and Shatilla
massacres ordered his occupation army to impose a hermetic siege on Palestinian population
centres, effectively reducing the West Bank into as many as 45 crowded enclosures which
some human rights organizations described as &#147;concentration camps minus the gas
chambers.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That siege, the sheer barbarity of which transcends reality, is still
intact, and its nefarious psychological and other impacts on men, women and children are
endured round-the-clock.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians are still the main target of Sharon&#146;s venom, but
other countries and peoples in the region are also on his agenda.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These include Egypt, the first Arab country to sign a peace treaty with
Israel, and also Jordan, which the certified war criminal still views as the
&#147;ultimate Palestinian homeland,&#148; in addition to Syria, Iraq and Iran.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to press reports, Sharon spent the bulk of his maiden visit to
Washington, DC, as Prime Minister in fanning the flames of hatred and incitement against
the Arab States and Iran.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He reportedly urged the U.S. to scale down arms supplies to Egypt, arguing
that the most populous Arab country shouldn&#146;t be allowed to achieve even a distant
military parity with the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionist sources denied that Sharon had made such requests to President
George W. Bush. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it seems that Sharon did talk about Egypt to people who influence
Bush and certainly berated Egypt during a meeting with the Jewish lobby. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Sharon had the audacity to complain that Egyptian President
Husni Mubarak was not doing what the Zionist premier said he should be doing, namely
hectoring and cajoling Yasser Arafat to surrender to Israel by accepting her
&#147;generous&#148; offer in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sharon&#146;s anti-Egyptian remarks ought to be taken very seriously as
they are indicative of his intention to see Israel achieve unchallenged military and
strategic supremacy in the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His ominous intentions to that effect were further accentuated by his
repeated insinuations about Iran&#146;s alleged endeavours to acquire &#147;weapons of
mass destruction,&#148; as if only the Zionist regime has that right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, he didn&#146;t utter a single word about Israel&#146;s huge
arsenal of nuclear, chemical and biological weapons, which, he would have us believe, is
for peaceful purposes!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, Sharon is trying rabidly and frantically to use the American
sword to subjugate and subdue Arab and Muslim peoples in the Middle East in order to
enable Israel to impose its hegemony throughout the region. In this, he is imitating the
Biblical figure Esther who incited the king of Persia to kill the enemies of the Jews in
his kingdom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light, it is imperative that the principal Arab and Islamic States in
the region make it abundantly clear to this impetuous war criminal that his threats would
definitely boomerang on him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, Arab States, especially in the Gulf region, should
seriously demonstrate to the United States that her relations and interests in the region
would suffer irreparably if the U.S. continues to back Zionist aggression and bellicosity.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More importantly, the rise of Sharon to power in the Zionist regime and
the growing drift among Zionists toward religious and fascist extremism should serve as an
appropriate occasion for contemplating some form of strategic cooperation between the Arab
States and Iran.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this cooperation is becoming a pressing necessity as never before.</p>
