<H3><CENTER>Israel predetermines the fate of the West Bank as
redeployment is carried out</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</B></P>

<P>After a series of delays and mini-crises, the Israeli army
finally carried out the first phase of the Wye River agreement
on 20 November by handing over to the Palestinian Authority as
many as 33 villages and hamlets around the city of Jenin, the
West Bank's northernmost town.<BR>
The redeployment process itself was brief, even symbolic, and
involved little or no army movement of note in or around the vacated
areas since cadres representing various PA security agencies had
already been operating in these villages with Israeli knowledge
and tacit approval.<BR>
The total area of these villages is around 500 square kilometres,
four fifths of which became area (A) while the remaining 100 square
kilometres (around 2% of area C where Israel maintains full administrative
and security authority) were relegated to area B, which means
the PA will exercise only civilian responsibilities while the
Israelis will retain the security authority.<BR>
With the latest redeployment in the Jenin area, the PA will have
under its full control 10% of the West Bank. Moreover, when the
second and third phases of the Wye River memorandum are carried
out, the PA will have full internal control over 18% of the West
Bank and partial control over 28% of the territory.<BR>
However, these figures can not be taken for granted since Israel
does not count East Jerusalem and the large confiscated areas
annexed to it as part of the West Bank.</P>

<P><B><U>Ratification of the Wye River Memorandum</U></B><BR>
The ratification of the Wye River Memorandum by the Israeli Government
on 19 November was adopted only after the PA issued a series of
mostly imprecise and poorly worded decrees aimed at &quot;safeguarding
national unity and protecting national interests.&quot;<BR>
These included the &quot;anti-incitement decree&quot;, the decree
on the confiscation of illegal fire-arms, including fake weapons,
and a ban on driving cars carrying Israeli license plates by Palestinians.<BR>
The decree, announced in Hebron on 19 November by Arafat's advisor
Al Tayeb Abdul Rahim, was scoffed at by many Palestinians, who
argued that &quot;it suited Israel more than us&quot;.<BR>
However, most people, including the Islamist camp, didn't seem
to take the decree seriously, as they realized that it was meant
first and foremost to meet Israeli dictates and demands.<BR>
On 20 November, Arafat's police chief in Gaza, Ghazi al Jabali,
issued the so-called &quot;decommissioning of fire-arms decree&quot;,
which urged all Palestinians in the autonomous enclaves to hand
over to the PA all unlicensed fire-arms in their possessions in
a period not exceeding two weeks. The decree proscribes stiff
monetary fines on violators.<BR>
Finally, the same al Jabali issued a third decree against &quot;driving
or owning a vehicle without a proper Palestinian license plate.&quot;<BR>
This latest decree is ostensibly aimed at fighting the huge car-theft
phenomenon. However, since the bulk of car thieves within the
PA enclaves are connected with the security agencies (and the
Israeli intelligence), there is not much al Jabali or any other
PA official can do to stop this lucrative business.</P>

<P><B><U>Implementation of the Wye Memorandum</U></B><BR>
Besides the redeployment in the West Bank's northern parts, the
implementation of the first phase of the Wye memorandum included
two additional accords, the first on the opening of the Gaza airport
on 24 November, and the release of 250 Palestinian prisoners.<BR>
The PA-controlled media celebrated the opening of &quot;Yasser
Arafat's International Airport&quot;, which will be the Palestinians'
main outlet to the outside world, as a &quot;great victory&quot;.<BR>
Yasser Arafat himself toured the facility on 22 November, saying
the airport was a symbol of Palestinian Statehood.<BR>
However, apart from the many Palestinian symbols in the airport,
e.g. Arafat's ubiquitous portraits, Palestinian flags, carts bearing
the phrase &quot;Palestine National Airline&quot;, etc., the Israeli
army will exercise complete security responsibility at the airport
for three months, by the end of which new negotiated arrangements
will be reached.<BR>
The most scandalous flaw blemishing the airport agreement is the
fact that Israel will have the final say in deciding who can and
who can not reach the airport.<BR>
Israeli roadblocks will be erected on all routes to the airport,
and those Palestinians deemed by the Israeli intelligence as &quot;objectionable&quot;
will not be allowed to proceed either from Gaza to the airport,
or from the airport to Gaza.<BR>
This is very significant since the Israeli authorities maintain
long blacklists of Palestinians who are barred from travelling
abroad, such as this writer, for &quot;security reasons&quot;.<BR>
The list includes political activists, university professors,
writers and journalists, in addition to college students, supporters
of Islamist movements, prominent critics of the Oslo process and
former prisoners.<BR>
The PA did not object much to the virtual Israeli control of passenger
movement to and from the airport probably because Israel gave
assurances that &quot;only opposition figures would be turned
back.&quot;<BR>
If the airport agreement was scandalous, the prisoners release
was even more so.<BR>
The PA had been saying all along that the Wye memorandum stipulated
the release of 750 political activists and freedom fighters.<BR>
However, when the first 250 prisoners were released on 20 November,
it turned out that most of them (150) were actually common criminals,
including car thieves.<BR>
Feeling cheated and embarrassed by the Israeli feat, which is
not the first of its kind, the PA accused the Israeli Government
of &quot;deception and cheating&quot;.<BR>
Chief Palestinian negotiator, Dr. Saeb Ureikat, protested the
Israeli act saying, &quot;We didn't go to Wye Plantation to negotiate
the release of car thieves and common criminals.&quot;<BR>
The refusal by Israel to release political prisoners and former
freedom fighters infuriated many Palestinians, especially relatives
who had been told by the PA that their loved ones would be released,
and drew strong criticisms of &quot;the sloppy and unprofessional
performance of PA negotiators at Wye Plantation.&quot;<BR>
Interestingly, Arafat, who is enjoying the redeployment &quot;victory&quot;,
has not retorted to Netanyahu, saying only that the PA remained
committed to freeing all Palestinian prisoners.</P>

<P><B><U>Underlying the Redeployment</U></B><BR>
The redeployment near Jenin was preceded with a vitriolic exchange
of statements by Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, his
Foreign Minister Ariel Sharon, and Arafat.<BR>
The public acrimony began when Netanyahu said the Wye River memorandum
served to lower Palestinian expectations vis-&agrave;-vis the
final settlement, suggesting the PA would eventually come to terms
with &quot;vital Israeli interests-Judea and Samaria&quot;. These
interests, he pointed out, included the annexation of the Jordan
Valley, the estimated 194 Jewish settlements in the West Bank
and Gaza Strip, Gush Itzion (the area extending from Bethlehem
to Hebron) and a 3-kilometre-wide security zone along the former
armistice line between the West Bank and Israel proper. This is,
he added, in addition to keeping Jerusalem as Israel's eternal
and undivided capital, the mantra routinely intoned by Israeli
officials.<BR>
Moreover, Netanyahu repeated what he had been saying ever since
he returned form Wye Plantation-the third phase of redeployment
in the West Bank would cover no more than 1% of the West Bank.
And in a gesture probably meant to frustrate Arafat, Netanyahu
added that the &quot;Palestinian leadership as well as the American
administration understood the Israeli position to that effect.&quot;<BR>
Arafat did retort on 15 November saying, &quot;we will accept
nothing short of an independent Palestinian State with Jerusalem
as its capital.&quot; In a speech marking the 10th anniversary
of the Palestinian declaration of independence, which took place
in Algiers in 1988, Arafat said, &quot;we will soon have 40% of
the West Bank under our control, and after the third phase, we
will have the rest, and afterwards we will march to Jerusalem,
our eternal capital, and be it as it may.&quot;<BR>
Furthermore, Arafat reaffirmed his intention to declare Statehood
by 4 May 1999, saying before a cheering multitude of his supporters,
&quot;we will declare the State in May.&quot;<BR>
What angered the Israelis most, however, and gave Netanyahu a
pretext to &quot;postpone the implementation of the redeployment
until further notice&quot; was Arafat's speech to a Fatah congress
in East Jerusalem in which the Chairman said, &quot;We will brandish
our guns in order to extract our right to pray in Jerusalem&#133;because
Jerusalem was, is and will continue to be our capital, irrespective
of their whims.&quot;<BR>
The resurgence of the phraseology of defiance on Yasser Arafat's
part proved too unacceptable and too inflammatory for Netanyahu,
who did order the suspension of redeployment implementation &quot;until
Arafat retracted his statements and recommitted himself to a peaceful
resolution of contentious issues, including final status subjects.&quot;<BR>
Meanwhile, Ariel Sharon, obviously fed up with Netanyahu's less
than straightforward talk, decided to be himself, when he urged
settlers to take over all hilltops adjacent to their settlements.<BR>
&quot;Go and get the hilltops, whoever gets there first will have
the hills, and that which you don't grab will end up in their
hands&quot;, Sharon told a meeting of T'somet party supporters
on 15 November.<BR>
Predictably, his spasmodic remarks were well-received by the settlers
who, on 16 November, heeded his call and moved in to grab several
hills in three locations near Nablus and in the Ramallah areas.
This happened concomitantly with the pulverizing by Israeli army
bulldozers of thousands of Palestinian olive groves in twelve
locations throughout the West Bank for the purpose of opening
bypass roads for the settlements.</P>

<P><B><U>The calm before the storm</U></B><BR>
Far from viewing it as a great achievement, most Palestinians
seem to think that the redeployment of the Israeli army from 10%-13%
of the West Bank is only the calm that precedes the storm. This
probably explains the prevailing caution in peoples' reactions
and the absence of public euphoria, as was the case four years
ago on the eve of the signing of the Oslo Accords.<BR>
The unabated expansion of settlements, the planned annexation
by Israel of 10% of the West Bank (the so-called Meri land), along
with Sharon's provocative calls on settlers to grab as many hilltops
as possible before Palestinian hands reach them, all suggest that
soon after the Wye memorandum is implemented, the bitter struggle
will be resumed, and guns from both sides will be brandished and
blood from both sides will be shed.</P>

<H3><CENTER>PA cracks down on Hamas following martyrdom operation</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh</B><BR>
Underscoring its determination to implement the Wye River Agreement,
the Palestinian Authority moved forcefully against Hamas following
the 29 October car-bomb attack near Khan Younis, arresting hundreds
of its rank and file and placing the movement's founder and spiritual
leader under house arrest. <BR>
Though confined to Gaza, the crack-down, ostensibly precipitated
by the botched suicide-bomb attack, was the most serious since
Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu came to power more than
two years ago.<BR>
In addition to taking unprecedented punitive measures against
Sheikh Yassin, including severing his telephone line and preventing
him from receiving visitors, Palestinian police arrested several
top Hamas leaders, including Mahmoud al Zahar, Ismael Abu Shanab,
Ismael Haniyya and Ahmed Baher. <BR>
Moreover, the spate of arrests was accompanied by the introduction
of certain restrictions on freedom of speech and expression, particularly
press freedom, prompting charges from civic leaders and liberal-minded
politicians that the PA was not only fighting violence but also
violating human rights and civil liberties.<BR>
More to the point, Gaza Police Chief Ghazi al Jabali issued a
decree banning the public torching of the Israeli and American
flags, arguing that the practice undermines Palestinian national
interests and hurts PA relations with Israel and the United States.<BR>
Meanwhile, the &quot;war of words&quot; between Hamas and the
PA escalated since the botched car-bomb attack at the Khan Younis
intersections. Hamas leaders accused the PA of repressing Hamas
in order to appease Israel and the United States irrespective
of human rights considerations. For its part, PA officials attacked
Hamas, accusing it of &quot;subservience to Iran&quot; and &quot;playing
into the hands of Jewish settlers and Israeli extremists who oppose
the Wye River agreement.&quot;<BR>
Defending the stringent measures against Hamas, PA official al
Tayeb Abdul Rahim said the timing of the 9 October operation was
meant to corrode the Wye Plantation agreement and give the Israeli
Government &quot;further excuses not to withdraw from Palestinian
land.&quot;<BR>
&quot;How would the Palestinian position have looked if the suicide
bomber had succeeded in killing 40 Israeli schoolboys and -girls?&quot;
said Abdul Rahim, justifying the crack-down on Hamas.<BR>
Hamas responded to this by arguing that the movement's political
leadership is totally separated from the military wing, the Ezzul
Deen al Qassam Brigades, and therefore it can't be held responsible
for its actions.<BR>
Indeed, several Hamas officials privately voiced consternation
at the Khan Younis car-bomb attack, saying it was politically
inexpedient, and wrong in timing<BR>
&quot;Those who planned and carried out the attack seemed to have
extended an open invitation to Yasser Arafat's police to come
and arrest us,&quot; said one Hamas leader in the Hebron area
on condition of anonymity.<BR>
Despite PA charges to the contrary, all signs indicate that the
Gaza leadership of Hamas played no part in planning, preparing
or executing the 29 October attack.<BR>
This suggested that the outside leadership of Hamas might have
ordered the attack, probably without the local leadership's approval.<BR>
This explained the virtual silence displayed by Islamist leaders
in Gaza, who, while denying direct responsibility for the attack,
refused to elaborate on who might have been directly responsible
for its planning and excution.<BR>
Hamas didn't like to accentuate the outside-inside divide since
this would undermine the projected unity of the movement in the
face of strenuous and relentless efforts by the PA to &quot;Palestinianize&quot;
Hamas by trying to ostracize and de-legitimize the movement's
leaders based in such Arab and Islamic capitals as Amman, Damascus,
Beirut and Tehran.<BR>
The PA didn't completely reject Hamas disavowals. PA officials,
unable to produce hard evidence incriminating Islamist detainees,
alleged that &quot;an Iranian trend within Hamas&quot; was responsible
for the attack. The PA further alleged that the Iranian-backed
group &quot;was planning to assassinate PA officials.&quot;<BR>
Most Palestinians, however, didn't take seriously the talk about
an Iranian-backed faction within Hamas for objective reasons having
to do with Hamas's staunch ideological independence and reputed
adamant refusal to be at any State's beck and call.<BR>
Moreover, the PA campaign to that effect seemed to be targeting
Iran as much as, if not more than, Hamas, especially after the
supreme Iranian leader Ali Khamenae castigated PA Chairman Yasser
Arafat for &quot;signing this treacherous agreement which compromises
Muslim rights in Palestine and al Quds.&quot;<BR>
Then why hit Hamas local leadership, risking inter-Palestinian
fighting and sagging popularity among ordinary Palestinians opposed
to collective punishment reminiscent of Israeli occupation practices.?<BR>
The answer is clear: making Hamas leaders and supporters in Gaza
suffer is the most effective way of deterring their colleagues
abroad from carrying out further attacks against Israel, and,
consequently, harming Palestinian interests and undermining Yasser
Arafat's Palestinian Authority.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Speakers: Muslim unity is pre-condition for liberation
of al Quds</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (al Quds, 16 November)</B> Muslim speakers
in al Quds marked the occasion of &quot;Isra and Miraj&quot; anniversary,
Prophet Muhammed's night journey from Mecca to Baitul Maqdes (Jerusalem)
and his subsequent heavenly flight to the Throne of the Almighty,
with calls on Muslim leaders and peoples the world-over to display
unity in order to qualify for the liberation of Palestine and
the delivery of al Masjidul Aqsa from Zionist hands.<BR>
Sheikh Muhammed Hussein, Imam of al Masjidul Aqsa, said Muslim
unity was the key to the liberation of al Quds and the recovery
of Muslim rights from Zionist hands.<BR>
&quot;Muslim unity is essential for any meaningful endeavour to
restore the Islamic holy places in Baitul Maqdes&#133;the current
state of fragmentation and division among Muslim States and peoples
can only perpetuate Zionist hegemony and aggression,&quot; said
Hussein before thousands of Muslims at al Masjidul Aqsa.<BR>
He added that Zionist Jews and their allies in the West could
not have seized Palestine from Muslim hands had they found a strong
and united Muslim Umma (community).<BR>
The Palestinian Islamist leader also called on Muslim regimes
to try to deliver themselves from the shackles of Western powers,
particularly the United States, which, he said, is the world's
foremost evil power.<BR>
Ikrema Sabri, the Mufti of Jerusalem, pointed out that the Isra
and Miraj anniversary was a reminder of the Islamic identity of
Palestine.<BR>
He pointed out that the Prophet Muhammed (pbuh) brought about
the moral conquest of Palestine long before Muslim armies set
foot on the soil of al Quds.<BR>
This, Sabri said, underscores the &quot;Islamicity&quot; of Palestine,
past, present and future until the Day of Judgement.<BR>
As in al Quds, Muslim speakers at al Khalil's (Hebron's) al Haram
al Ibrahimi al Sharif celebrated the sacred anniversary in the
shadow of the Zionist occupiers' guns.<BR>
Arif al Jabari, deputy-minister of Wakf in the Palestinian Authority,
said sooner or later, Palestine and Jerusalem would revert to
where they rightly belong, to the Muslim Umma.<BR>
He recited the first few verses of Sura Isra that foresee the
ultimate demise of Zionist rule in Palestine at the hands of &quot;true
and dedicated servants of the Almighty.&quot;<BR>
Jabari said Muslims could form a superpower provided they abandon
their old and un-Islamic ways such as despotism and disunity,
as well as excessive worldliness and materialism.<BR>
Sheikh Fathi Amre, Head of Religious Orientation at al Khalil's
Wakf department, said the Isra and Miraj anniversary reminded
us all that al Quds and al Masjidul Aqsa were a trust in every
Muslim's heart.<BR>
He appealed to Muslims saying, &quot;Don't abandon al Masjidul
Aqsa; don't give up, because if you do, Allah will abandon you
and let you down.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>Fatah Prisoners to Arafat: &quot;You betrayed us&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>PT (21 November)-</B> &quot;You have betrayed us, Mr President&quot;;
this is how Fatah prisoners in Israeli jails began their letter
to PA chairman Yasser Arafat on 21 November following Israeli
refusal to release them.<BR>
Palestinian sources said the letter described the Wye River agreement
as &quot;humiliating&quot; and &quot;disgraceful&quot; and &quot;filled
with Israeli dictates and blackmail.&quot;<BR>
Most of the estimated 3,000 prisoners in Israeli jails belong
to the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). However, Fatah says
that as many as 500 prisoners formerly associated with the movement
were still languishing in Israeli jails because they were involved
&quot;in killing Jews.&quot;<BR>
Israel has always refused to release Palestinian prisoners who
belonged to Hamas or &quot;had blood on their hands&quot;, e.g.
killed Israeli soldiers or settlers.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Arafat's advisor likens Wye to Prophet's successes</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>PT (16 November) -</B> Yasser Arafat's advisor, Suleiman
al Sharafa, lambasted Hamas and Palestinians opposed to the Wye
River agreement, saying the agreement was a great victory corresponding
to the Prophet Muhammed's successes following the Isra'a and Miraj
(the Prophet's miraculous flight by night from Mecca to Jerusalem
and his heavenly journey to the throne of God).<BR>
Speaking during a celebration marking the solemn occasion in Gaza,
al Sharafa said the opposition were taking up attitudes similar
to those adopted by the polytheists of Mecca who disbelieved the
Prophet.<BR>
The corrupt analogy was condemned by Islamist leaders in Gaza,
who described them as &quot;cheap and irresponsible.&quot;<BR>
Several PA political and security officials escalated their attacks
on Islamist leaders following the Wye River agreement for their
opposition to the memorandum.<BR>
The PA arrested hundreds of Hamas supporters in Gaza and the West
Bank following the accords, mainly to appease Israeli and American
demands.<BR>
Moreover, the PA imposed a house-arrest on Hamas founder, Sheikh
Ahmed Yassin, and prevented him from having access to the media,
severed his telephone line and barred him from leaving his home.<BR>
Moreover, the PA issued a decree banning &quot;anti-Israeli propaganda
and other forms of incitement.&quot;<BR>
The decree was castigated by civic leaders in the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip who said it would virtually silence Palestinian
criticism of Israeli repression of Palestinians and the confiscation
of their land and demolition of their homes.</P>

anti incitement decree.<BR>
The decree listed acts of incitement, including &quot;racial discrimination&quot;,
&quot;incitement to violence&quot;, &quot;degrading various religions&quot;,
and the formation of &quot;societies and associations that practice
incitement and spoils life or agitates the masses for change through
violence.&quot;<BR>
The poorly worded decree, say observers, is with no substance,
since the violations stipulated in it are not common in Palestine.<BR>
For example, it is the Palestinians who are the primary victim
of Israeli incitement, not the opposite.<BR>
Moreover, Palestinians, the majority of whom are Muslims, recognize
other monotheistic religions and accord them ample veneration
and respect.<BR>
This is unlike wide sectors of religious Jews who use extremely
derogatory labels when referring to Islam and Christianity.<BR>
What is particularly scandalous about Arafat's decree is that
it was not reciprocated by similar commitments on the Israeli
side, especially with concern to incitement to murder Palestinians
by Jewish rabbis throughout Jewish settlements.<BR>
On 21 November, Israeli officials expressed profound dissatisfaction
at the failure by the PA &quot;to stop incitement against Jews
and Zionists.&quot;<BR>
Israeli officials cited two examples of continued PA incitement:
the first was the Juma'a Friday sermon at al Masjidul Aqsa in
which the speaker, Hayyan al Idrisi, called on the Muslim Umma
to pay more attention to Zionist attempts to destroy the al Aqsa
Mosque and his reaffirmation that Palestine was, is and will continue
to be Islamic.<BR>
The third example was an article on the official PA Web site on
the internet in which Zionism was referred to as a racist ideology.<BR>
In 1974, the United Nations adopted a resolution considering Zionism
a form of racism.<BR>
Israel, the Zionist State, still views itself as &quot;a State
for the Jews&quot; not a &quot;state for its citizens.&quot;</P>

<H3><CENTER>PA seeks to mobilize support following redeployment</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>PT (20 November) -</B> The Palestinian Authority has been
trying to obtain public support after the conclusion of the Wye
agreement and the implementation of the first redeployment of
the Israeli forces around Jenin.<BR>
PA security and civilian organizations held several big rallies
in Nablus, Ramallah and Hebron to mark the so-called &quot;independence
day&quot; during which Yasser Arafat spoke of &quot;the nearness
of the fulfillment of our dream of a Palestinian State with Jerusalem
as its capital.&quot;<BR>
However, it seemed that apart from Arafat and the close circle
of advisors and hangers-on around him, and probably a small but
vocal group of fanatic supporters, the majority of Palestinians
wouldn't &quot;buy it this time&quot;, probably out of awareness
of the adage &quot;bitten once, shy twice.&quot;<BR>
Indeed, most Palestinians seemed to realize that the current redeployment
of the Israeli troops would probably be the last, and that instead
of heralding the acquisition of more Palestinian rights and Statehood,
the Wye agreement would only be a harbinger for the resumption
of the bitter struggle with the Zionists over Palestine. Hence,
the caution.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Jewish historian: The future of Jews lies in the re-establishment
of Caliphate</CENTER></H3>

<P>A Jewish historian from Tel Aviv has called on Arabs and Muslims
to re-establish the Islamic caliphate &quot;in order to bring
about a genuine, durable and just resolution of the conflict between
Israelis and Palestinians. &quot; Professor Meyer Kaplan said
in an interview with Palestine Times that the future of Jews in
Palestine would look doubtful and precarious if the current state
of Zionism remained unchanged, which he said necessitated the
establishment of an umbrella Islamic caliphate transcending geopolitical
borders and covering Palestine. He said that Jews would accept
in principle Islamic sovereignty over Palestine &quot;provided
that the caliphate rules according to the law of the Prophet.&quot;
He cited the &quot;law of Medina&quot; as the most appropriate
law of the land in a prospective Islamic State where &quot;Jews,
Muslims, Christians and others are considered citizens of the
Islamic State.&quot; Kaplan lashed out at the current peace process,
saying it is &quot;nothing&quot; from the historical point of
view, and that, historically speaking, it is not worth the paper
on which it is written. &quot;Neither Jews nor Arabs are satisfied
with it, so each party will wait until the time is ripe to leap
on the other&quot;, he said.</P>

<H3><CENTER>PA's law of the jungle</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Gaza- (19 November)</B> Palestinian Authority police have
kept Sheikh Ahmed Yassin under house-arrest for the third consecutive
week, refusing to allow him to receive visitors and barring him
from performing prayers at his neighbourhood mosque.<BR>
The PA has not yet given any official reason for the &quot;house-arrest&quot;
and PA officials continued to issue conflicting statements on
the matter. On 18 November, police chief Ghazi al Jabali attacked
Sheikh Yassin saying, &quot;placing him under house-arrest is
the lesser of the two evils to protect him from his own evil and
protect the Palestinian people as well.&quot; However, Muhammed
Dahlan, head of the Preventive Security Force in Gaza, said, &quot;the
house-arrest of Sheikh Yassin came about to protect him from Israeli
agents.&quot; Never the less, observers noticed that the real
motive behind the house-arrest was to silence the sheikh and prevent
him from talking to the media, especially Arab satellite television
channels.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Israel reactivates &quot;death squads&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P>Israeli sources said on 19 November the Israeli army reconstructed
one of its death squads, which was active in murdering Palestinians
during the intifadah (1987-1993).<BR>
According to the Israeli daily, Ma'ariv, a number of high-ranking
Israeli officers took part in a special ceremony marking the reactivation
of the undercover force known as &quot;Samson&quot; or Shimshon
in Hebrew. The paper said that among the officers taking part
in the ceremony were the Commander of the Southern Area, Yom Tov
Samya, Commander of the Israeli army in Gaza, Yoab Glenet, and
the Commander of the Samson unit Saghi Telmi. Israeli undercover
units, whose soldiers disguise themselves as Palestinians, assassinated
many ordinary Palestinians, including children, during the intifadah.
Israeli and Palestinian sources estimated the number of Palestinians
killed at the hands of these units at 120, most of them innocent
bystanders.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Israel to confiscate &quot;meri land&quot;</CENTER></H3>

<P>On the eve of the partial implementation of the Wye River agreement,
the Israeli Government announced plans to seize the West Bank's
&quot;meri land&quot;, e.g. State land whose ownership was with
the Ottoman State before the First World War. Meri land makes
up over 10% of the West Bank, and the Israeli decision to confiscate
it makes it the biggest land grab by the Zionists since 1967.
According to the Israeli State-run radio, Voice of Israel, the
land would be used to expand existing Jewish settlements. <BR>
The seizure of the land, along with the opening of scores of new
wide bypass roads, suggests, in no vague manner, that the Israeli
Government is not interested in real peace with the Palestinians.
It also shows that the current developments in the peace process
are disingenuous and that a bitter, violent and bloody showdown
with the Palestinians is coming, sooner rather than later.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Zionist occupiers destroy more Arab homes in Jerusalem</CENTER></H3>

<P>The Zionist occupiers have escalated the diabolical practice
of destroying Arab homes in East Jerusalem in an effort to check
Arab demographic growth. According to a recent bulletin published
by the East Jerusalem-based &quot;land research centre&quot;,
the Israeli Government and municipal authorities have invented
a new set of ways and legal tricks to prevent Arabs from building,
thereby giving the Israelis the green light to destroy homes allegedly
built without license. The bulletin pointed out that the number
of Palestinian houses destroyed in Jerusalem reached (so far)
27 houses, while the average number of houses destroyed annually
since 1990 was 28 houses. The bulletin said the Israeli goals
behind the house-demolition policy included &quot;narrowing Palestinians'
horizons&quot;, &quot;narrowing as much as possible land ownership
by Arabs&quot;, &quot;reducing Palestinian demographic as well
as human presence&quot;, and classifying much of the Arab-owned
land as &quot;public gardens or green areas&quot; in order to
prevent Palestinians from building homes thereon.</P>

<H3><CENTER>Likud, Labour lose in Israeli local elections</CENTER></H3>

<P><B>Occupied Jerusalem (16 November)</B> The two main political
parties in Israel, the Likud and Labour, have voiced mounting
anxiety about their dwindling popularity following last month's
local elections in Israel, which many observers contend have carried
a plain message of &quot;no confidence&quot; in Israeli party
politics.<BR>
That message was conveyed throughout the Jewish State, as voters
in one electoral circle after the other shunned Likud and Labor
candidates, mainly in favour of independents and break-away faction
leaders. In fact, in many cases, even those Labor and Likud candidates
who managed to win did so by distancing themselves from their
parties, which they came to view as a liability rather than an
asset.<BR>
Undoubtedly, the biggest loser in the elections was the Likud,
the party of Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, which lost the
municipal councils of virtually all big towns with the exception
of Jerusalem. Moreover, in addition to the Mayorships, the Likud
also lost its representative majority in scores of important towns
to independents, local and small parties and, to a lesser extent,
to the Labor party.<BR>
Buffeted by the election results, Netanyahu initially sought to
put on a brave face, arguing, rather rightly, that the voters
rebuffed not just the Likud but Labor as well. The Israeli premier,
however, admitted later that there was &quot;something wrong in
our system&quot;, adding that the big parties must draw the right
conclusions from the election results.<BR>
Likewise, the Labor party, despite its limited successes in Tel
Aviv, Beir al Saba'a and a few additional localities, could not
conceal its anxiety about the overall trend of anti-party politics
in Israel, as seen in the elections' outcome. This, observers
suggest, is evidence that the mainstream public in Israel is moving
away from the established political parties.<BR>
Indeed, Labor Party leader Ehud Barak recognized, somewhat begrudgingly,
that &quot;all was not right for Labor&quot;, saying that &quot;the
big political parties must reconsider their ways to prevent smaller
parties and local groups from taking over national politics.&quot;<BR>
Barak, like many politicians from right and left, blamed the new
electoral system of a direct election of Prime Minister for the
looming crisis in the Israeli political system. He suggested that
the system be scrapped in favour of the older proportional representation
system. Barak, it is well known, was among the foremost supporters
of the current system, unlike many in the Labor party, including
former Israeli Prime Minister Shimon Peres. Hence, his vacillation
to that effect could affect his election results negatively since
it would project him as a leader with undecided political thoughts.<BR>
Underlying the crisis in the Israeli election system is what is
referred to as the &quot;Americanization of Israeli elections&quot;,
both on the local and national levels, whereby the emphasis is
put on &quot;personality&quot; rather than &quot;ideology&quot;
or &quot;party affiliation&quot;.<BR>
The main problem stemming from this &quot;Americanization&quot;
is the fact that the mainstream Israeli parties are not yet ready
for it, as seen in the latest elections. So far, the Israeli election
system worked from top to bottom, which meant that voters voted
essentially at their parties' call, and candidates were elected
mostly for their party affiliation.<BR>
Now this formula, which has prevailed so far, is about to change,
meaning that the voters are beginning to give less attention to
ideology and more weight to performance and such personality-related
characteristics as honesty, veracity, skill and public service
record, which are considered a rare commodity in both the Likud
and Labor parties.<BR>
Clearly, the big parties are not ready to succumb to the new phenomenon
and are actually moving to reverse it before it becomes too overwhelming
to stop.<BR>
In the last few days, a number of Israeli politicians and Knesset
members have suggested several alternatives to the direct election
of the Prime Minister. The Speaker of the Knesset, Dan Tichon,
suggested the minimum representation rate (the so-called passage
boundary) be raised from 2% to 5% of the overall vote, thus enabling
the big parties such as Labor and Likud to actually arrogate (the
lost) votes destined to smaller parties that won't make it to
the Knesset.<BR>
Needless to say, this suggestion is likely to be rejected by the
smaller parties, which see its implementation as a mortal threat
to their very survival.<BR>
Meanwhile, some politicians, especially from the Likud, and also
from Labor, have urged for a return to the old classical system
of proportional representation as &quot;the least of the two evils.&quot;<BR>
This system, its advocates argue, would reintroduce the lost balance
to Israeli politics. However, critics argue that reverting to
the old system would force the big parties to seek out the formation
of fragile coalitions with smaller parties, thus making the big
parties hostage and their coalitions hostage to whims and blackmail
demands of smaller parties, the junior coalition partners.<BR>
A significant development in the Israeli election was the considerable
rise in the &quot;Haredim&quot; (religious Jews) representation
in Jerusalem's new municipal council. The Haredim won 15 seats
of the town's 31 seats, enabling them to have virtual veto power
on all issues. The vanishing power of secular forces, along with
the Arab boycott of the election, shows that Jerusalem is becoming
a &quot;fundamentalist Jewish stronghold.&quot;<BR>
This, it goes without saying, will auger bad for the future of
the divided city, especially the prospects of peace between Jews
and Palestinians.</P>

<P><B><U>The Arab Sector</U></B><BR>
The election results in the Arab sector, which makes up 20% of
the population, showed a similar trend, taking the form of the
prevailing national issues, which hitherto united the collective
Arab consciousness in Israel, at the expense of local, clan, sectarian
and even personal considerations.<BR>
The most conspicuous feature, however, was the dwindling popularity
of the communist party known as the Democratic Front for Peace
and Equality.<BR>
The front lost several of its traditional strongholds, such as
Dir Hanna and Kufr Yasive, where the communists had maintained
their grip on local politics for over 20 years.<BR>
The front suffered its biggest loss in Nazereth, where the Arab
Democratic List (a coalition of the Islamic Movement and the Arab
Democratic Party) won 10 seats of the 19 contested seats forming
the municipal board, thus denying the communists their majority,
which they had maintained since 1976.<BR>
This means that Ramez Jarayseh, the town's communist mayor who
narrowly defeated the Islamist candidate Suleiman Ahmed, will
have to form a coalition with the Islamic majority in the Council,
a task that is certainly not going to be easy.<BR>
The Islamic movement, the front's traditional rival, made certain
successes in several towns and villages, particularly in Um al
Fahem, where the incumbent Sheikh Raed Salah won a third term
by a stunning 70% of the total votes.<BR>
Never the less, the general trend in the Arab sector was a shift
in favour of the Hamula, the extended clan, and independents.<BR>
This represented a definite setback for national platforms that
emphasized just peace for Palestinians in the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip and equality for Israeli Arabs.<BR>
According to Abdul Malek Dahamshe, an Arab member of the Knesset,
the Oslo Accords made the Arab community more inward-looking,
since the Israeli-Palestinian conflict is perceived as &quot;on
its way to resolution.&quot;<BR>
This trend, Dahamshe opines, is negative and harmful to Arab interests,
because the conflict is &quot;far from over&quot; and equality
for Israeli Arabs &quot;is still an illusive and distant dream.&quot;</P>
