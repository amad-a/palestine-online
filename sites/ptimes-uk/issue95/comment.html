<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is almost certain by now that the Palestinian Authority leadership
will take a decision to postpone the much-heralded declaration of Statehood, originally
slated for 4 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This decision, which has been widely expected, apparently came after
the United States offered Yasser Arafat a set of assurances or guarantees in return for
the postponement decision.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The said assurances, which many observers say are meant as a
face-saving measure for Arafat, include, <i>inter alia</i>, a vague American promise to
support the Palestinian people&#146;s right to self-determination on its national soil.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, the assurances reportedly include a promise to renew the
American commitment to get the peace process back on track, a routine diplomatic phrase
that has very little substance in reality. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The old-new American assurances are expected to generate some rhapsody,
even euphoria, among the Palestinian leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Some PA officials already went as far as calling the assurances a
&#147;Balfour Declaration for the Palestinians,&#148; a description that is too
far-fetched to be real or reasonable.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">More false euphoria and corrupt analogies are expected to float around
in the media in the weeks and months ahead, given the new illusion that the United States
has amended or transformed its pro-Zionist policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This illusion (there is no other word to describe it) will be proven
disastrous for the Palestinians if only because their disappointment will be greater once
that illusion is dissipated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">To begin with, it must be stressed that the weight of the offered
assurances will largely hedge on the outcome of the upcoming Israeli elections, slated for
17 May.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, if Benyamin Netanyahu wins, and he has a good (50%) chance of
winning, the PA can forget about the assurances and about something called the &#147;peace
process&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, a government headed by Netanyahu and made up of the fanatic
demagogues of &#147;Eretz Yisrael&#148; or &#147;Land of Israel&#148; would be utterly
unlikely to vacate any more Palestinian territory in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If Ehud Barak becomes Israel&#146;s next Prime Minister, it is equally
unlikely that the American Administration will pressure him to offer Arafat a much better
deal than Netanyahu did.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, Barak has already indicated that his &#147;programme&#148; in
the West Bank does not really differ much from that of Netanyahu. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, when Barak&#146;s and Netanyahu&#146;s platforms on the
Palestinian issue are cross-examined, they appear merely as tweedledum and tweedledee.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the meantime, it is hoped that the Palestinian leadership will use
the one-year respite, leading up to the new designated date for Palestinian Statehood (4
May 2000) to deliver itself and the Palestinian people from the shackles and fetters of
the treacherous Oslo Accords.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PA, which sold the Palestinian people a great preponderance of
illusion and mirage, is urged now to rebuild and rearrange the Palestinian house on a
sounder basis, away from the destructive and humiliating terms of Oslo and its subsequent
brats, such as the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This hope was probably the reason behind the Islamist forces&#146;
decision to attend the Central Council meeting in Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That decision, needless to say, reflects a profound sense of national
responsibility as well as a genuine desire on the part of Hamas and Islamic Jihad leaders
to help the Palestinian leadership extricate itself from subservience and subjugation to
the Zionist establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the face of this gesture of goodwill, the PA should reciprocate with
a gesture of its own, for example, releasing political prisoners who have not been charged
or tried.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Certainly, a step as such would send an unmistakable signal to the
arrogant Zionist premier who has been demanding that the PA and its leader Yasser Arafat
become a Palestinian carbon copy of the quisling entity in Southern Lebanon, known as the
Southern Lebanese Army. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All in all, the Palestinian struggle is far from over, and even the
prospective declaration of Palestinian Statehood will only underscore the need for more
Palestinian struggle for true liberation and genuine freedom.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In any case, Palestinians, leaders and the masses must not forget for a
moment that the very land on which they hope to build their State is still occupied by a
sinister enemy, and that it is congested with Jewish settlements that would be hard, but
not impossible, to root out.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Moreover, they must keep in mind the four million refugees dispersed
around the world, some of whom are still holding the keys to their former homes from which
they were expelled some 50 years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this must foster an atmosphere of unity among all Palestinians. It
is hoped that all Palestinian sides, particularly the PA, will understand this message and
act on it.</p>
