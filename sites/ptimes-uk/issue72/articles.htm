<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem- As Israel celebrated the 49th annual
anniversary of its establishment in Palestine, hundreds of thousands of
Haredi ultra-Orthodox Jews marked the &quot;repugnant anniversary&quot;
by pelting passing cars with stones, blocking streets with trash cans and,
more ominously, smashing tombstones at several military cemeteries in central
Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At Jerusalem's Mi'a Sha'arim neighbourhood, a traditional
stronghold of the ultra-Orthodox community, scores of black-draped, brim-hatted
Haredis clashed with the police along the Bar Illan Street, and shouted
anti-Zionism slogans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Other Haredis smashed tombstones at Holon's military cemetery
on the outskirts of Tel Aviv on 11 May, just a few hours after Israeli political
and military leaders participated in a solemn commemoration of the Jewish
state's fallen soldiers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Israeli sources, the Haredis scrawled anti-state
and anti-Zionist slogans in several locations at the military cemetery,
upsetting Israeli leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli President Ezer Weisman, sensing the Haredi disruption
of &quot;Independence Day&quot; celebrations, spoke of a wide and deep gap
between the secular and religious camps.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Referring to the smashing of tombstones in Holon, Weisman
said &quot;these shameless and despicable acts of vandalism are very dangerous.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu, himself under
fire from another religious camp (the Shas Party), said he was &quot;shocked&quot;
by this &quot;unbelievable act.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Three camps</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The religious sector in Israel is made up of three main
blocs. First, the so-called religious-Zionist camp, chiefly embodied in
the National Religious Party (MIFDAL) and the Gush Emunim movement (Bloc
of the Faithful). This camp harbours extreme racist, jingoistic and war-like
attitudes toward the Arabs and believes Israel should take over the entire
land of Israel, including the West Bank and Gaza Strip, as well as parts
of Jordan, Lebanon, Syria and Egypt, following &quot;biblical prophecy.&quot;
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, Gush Emunim produced such notorious extremists
and murderers as Rabbi Meir Kahane, Rabbi Moshe Levinger and Baruch Goldstein,
who murdered 29 Arab worshippers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron on 25
February 1994.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The second camp is the Shas Party, headed by Rabbi Ovadia
Yossef, former Chief Rabbi of Israel. The movement encompasses mainly Safardi
Jews who had immigrated from Arab and Muslim countries. Given their underprivileged
and inferior position in the Israeli society, Safardi Jews view with suspicion
and mistrust the political establishment in Israel, which has always been
dominated by Ashkenazi Jews of European origin.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Safardi community, which suffers a disproportionately
high degree of poverty, often accuses the political establishment of racial
discrimination against Jews of Middle Eastern origin, and of maintaining
an apartheid-like regime.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the first week of May, thousands of Shas supporters
converged on the Attorney-General headquarters in Jerusalem, shouting slogans
against the government and the judicial system. One rabbi went as far as
calling the Attorney-General a &quot;Nazi.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, hundreds of Shas supporters stormed the High
Court building in West Jerusalem on 13 May to protest the trial of the movement's
leader Arie Deri'e on charges of corruption, bribery and misuse of public
money. They seemed to be convinced that the charges were concocted by the
Ashkenazi establishment to discredit Deri'e and therefore undermine the
entire Safardi community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>More to the point, the matter could have serious political
ramifications for the Netanyahu government. Rabbi Yossef and Deri'e repeatedly
threatened to withdraw their support of the government if Netanyahu did
not take a pro-Deri'e stance in the upcoming trial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The third and most controversial segment of Israel's religious
sector is the ultra-Orthodox community, which follows an eschatological
and rather monomaniacal belief that no state for the Jews ought to be established
before the advent or appearance of the Messiah. Indeed, the Naturi Karta,
the most vocal group of the ultra-Orthodox Haredi community, believe that
the establishment of Israel in Palestine in 1948 was &quot;an apostatic
development&quot; portending &quot;doom and gloom&quot; for the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the rabbis of Naturi Karta argue that the state
of Israel poses a grave threat to the spiritual salvation and the very existence
of the Jewish people. Hence, followers of the movement, numbered in the
hundreds of thousands, adamantly refuse to bear Israeli passports, to serve
in the Israeli army, to salute the Israeli flag, or even to send their children
to public schools.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Dr. Abu Marzouk assails American justice
and vows to continue </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>his legitimate struggle against Occupation</FONT></H3>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Amman-Mahmoud al Khatib</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Mousa Abu Marzouk, the former political leader of
the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas), assailed the American judicial
system saying he did not see any justice during his 22-month ordeal. The
former Hamas leader emphasized that he would prefer facing baseless Israeli
charges against him rather than staying in a US jail. PT interviewed Dr.
Abu Marzouk in Amman after he was deported to Jordan.</FONT></I></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. In view of the developments
of your detention in New York, what do you think are the real reasons for
your detention?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. I have been asked this question
hundreds of times but in fact I have no answer. My name was put on the Immigration
and Naturalization Service&iacute;s persona non grata list without telling
me or anyone else why. Also, two months before my arrival in the United
States, the US Justice Department issued my re-entry visa and at the same
time added my name to the list. But, I believe that my name was added for
the sole purpose of serving Israel's interests.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. As a leader of Hamas, didn&iacute;t
you expect to be detained upon your arrival in New York?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. No, I did not because I
was there in February, five months before the ordeal. I also had never committed
any crime in or outside the United States, so I did not expect such an action
from the US authorities. I had also never been questioned by any security
officer in the United States. My comings and goings to and from the United
States had never been impeded before for any reason prior to my detention.
I was moving legally using my own name. I never used false or covert names.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Did you think that the Israeli
extradition request was based on evident charges against your person as
the leader of the political body of Hamas?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. It was a political step.
The Israeli request for my extradition was completely political because
it did not come through the Justice Ministry or the Public Prosecutor in
Israel. It was sent by the Israeli cabinet to the US Justice Department,
which ordered the start of the legal proceedings of my extradition to Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israelis also justified their decision of requesting
my extradition by saying that they wanted to maintain the peace process
and to stop the escalation of violence. However, the legal advisor of the
Israeli Foreign Ministry advised his Ministry that there was no legal evidence
against me and hence they would not be able to introduce any charge against
me before a civilian court in Israel. This proves that the Israeli request
was political.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. How do you assess the reaction
of the American public opinion and media to your cause?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. I used to read most of the
American newspapers in my cell, especially the articles that talked about
my case. I think, in general, they were fair and neutral. When I was released,
I wrote a letter thanking the American media for their fair and objective
stand concerning my situation.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. After about 22 months in
an American jail, how do you assess American justice?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. I did not find any kind
of justice in the United States. One of the reasons that pushed me to withdraw
my appeal from the second court of appeal was that I despaired of receiving
any justice in America. I am the first man in US history to be sentenced
to extradition without a hearing session. I am also the first politician
to be sentenced by an American court to be extradited to another country.
I am also the first in US history to stop fighting the extradition sentence
by withdrawing my appeal and asking to be extradited in order to face unfounded
charges in Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. If you had been extradited,
were you ready to face an Israeli court, and why?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Yes. Because I could not
stay in jail in the United States fighting forever in order to have a hearing
before the court. I waited for 22 months for a hearing but to no avail.
I realized that there was not any kind of justice for an Arab or a Muslim
in the United States. As a Palestinian, nobody acknowledged my rights and
I found myself in an endless dilemma. Also the charges against me were baseless
and untrue, so I decided to face them before an Israeli court.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. Dr. Abu Marzouk, what are
your future plans after the end of your ordeal?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. I am committed to serve
my Palestinian People and their cause anywhere and anytime until they restore
their full rights in their homeland. This was my commitment in the past
and it will remain so in the future.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Q</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. How does Dr. Abu Marzouk
assess the present political situation in the area?</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>A</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>. There were problems from
the beginning. The Israeli-PLO negotiators delayed a number of serious problems
to a later stage. From the beginning we knew that there would be no real
solutions to them. The Palestinian People will be the only losers in the
end because the Israelis are not anywhere close to being ready to fulfill
their commitments to the provisions of the Oslo Accords.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Extracts from the book</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>An Introduction to Hamas</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) is now considered
the most prominent movement representing the Islamic ideological line in
the Palestinian scene. It adopts Islam as a programme from which it takes
its ideas and conceptions. Shortly after its inception, the Movement defined
itself as a &quot;wing of Palestinian Muslim Brotherhood,&quot; making it
necessary to examine the historical, ideological and organizational relationships
between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood Movement.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Organizational Structure of Hamas</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The organizational structure of Hamas, like that of the
Muslim Brotherhood, generally depends on the basis of educating both the
individual and the family. Hamas has also adopted the approach of mobilizing
people around the ideological line of the Brotherhood and toward resisting
the Israeli occupation. The Movement has a unified leading Bureau that resorts
to a higher authority which is the 'Shura Council', a unified consultant
body elected directly by the cadres. The Leading Bureau forms various technical
systems. Security and military systems are formed as parts of the technical
systems.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its membership, the Movement, however, does not stipulate
membership in the Muslim Brotherhood.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas sources are quoted in order to stress that the Movement
adopts the principle of decentralization in its work and a policy of functional
independence. This is especially so when it comes to the necessary separation
between the political, informational and organizational structure on the
one hand and the military and security structure on the other.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Therefore, it can be said that Hamas works through three
defined systems: the Political Bureau, the Informational Bureau, and Ezzedin
Al Qassam Battalion, the military wing of the Movement.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Objectives of Hamas Movement</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Apart from being a national liberation movement seeking
the elimination of Israeli occupation, Hamas is also an Islamic Movement.
Its outlook on all aspects of life is inspired by the principles of Islam,
from which it draws its ideas and conceptions. However, this does not limit
the Movement's ability to practice a considerable amount of pragmatism and
flexibility without necessarily having to deviate from its basic principles.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Issue, confirms Hamas, is not the cause
of the Palestinians alone: it is rather the cause of Arabs and Muslims in
general, and solving this issue and making peace cannot be achieved unless
occupation is eliminated. By studying its literature, closely examining
its political activities and discussing its leaders, a general picture can
be drawn as to the objectives of the Movement. These objectives can be summarized
as follows:</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>First: The General objective/ establishing the Islamic
State</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas believes that the establishment of the state is a
result of liberation. It is the right of the Palestinian people, asserts
Hamas, to live in a democratic political system that is built on the principles
of Shura and political pluralism.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Second: The Strategic objective/ liberating the whole
Palestinian land</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas believes that Palestine, from the Mediterranean Sea
to the Jordan River and from north to south, is the land of the Palestinian
people. Hamas also believes that the Zionist Movement, in collaboration
with European colonialism, usurped a large part of the Palestinian land
in 1947 and completed its usurpation of the whole country in 1967. Accordingly,
Hamas considers the liberation of Palestine a strategic objective of its
programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Third: Interim objectives</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In its endeavour to achieve its general strategic objective,
Hamas has adopted several interim goals. The following are Hamas' main interim
goals:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1- The Liberation of the West Bank and Gaza Strip</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even after the Oslo Agreement, Hamas still believes that
about one third of Gaza Strip and more than half the West Bank are still
occupied in spite of the self rule agreements.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2- The Islamization of the society</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This is one of Hamas' goals as an Islamic movement working
in a society the majority of which believes in Islam as a religion, a culture
and a civilization. To achieve this goal, the Movement is building a network
of organizations in different fields.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3- Establishing the legitimacy of Armed Struggle</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas believes that resisting the occupation is a religious
and national duty which is approved by international law and UN charters.
Therefore, the Movement has sought to mobilize Palestinian masses and the
Arab, Islamic and international public opinion in such a way as to promote
the legitimacy of its resistance to the Israeli occupation. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4- The continuation of the Intifada</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas considered the Intifada as a stage in the continuing
resistance against Israeli occupation and as an expression of rejecting
occupation hegemony and injustice. It is with this view in mind that Hamas
was keen on keeping the Intifada beyond any political transactions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>5- Preserving the National Unity</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas has actively worked on the internal level to preserve
national unity and confront the Israeli policy of &quot;Divide and Rule.&quot;
The Movement has always stressed its commitment to its humanitarian and
tolerant attitude toward non-Muslims and its respect for other organizations.
Its official statements and communiqu&Egrave;s have always pointed out that
it is a movement for all Palestinian masses, Muslims and Christians alike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>6- Releasing prisoners and stopping Israeli aggression
against civilian Palestinians</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Movement has also aimed at releasing all prisoners
and preventing aggressions against Palestinian civilians. It has even offered
Israel a truce proposal by which both sides stop attacking civilian targets
including Israeli settlers if they are properly disarmed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>7- Activating the Arab and Islamic backing</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This activation for the Palestinian issue is the central
cause of Arabs and Muslims. This backing is considered the 'strategic reservoir'
of this cause.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Fourth: Circumstantial objectives</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1- Neutralizing Israeli military power</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hamas thought, at the beginning of the Intifada, that adopting
civil confrontation techniques such as stones and blockages would isolate
and neutralize the occupation's huge military might and equipment.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2- Establishing political legitimacy</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This political legitimacy has been achieved through the
active participation of Hamas in the Intifada and the ensuing persecution,
torture, deportation and martyrdom of Hamas members.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Means of Hamas Movement</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>1- Mosque activities</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As an Islamic ideological movement, Hamas had concerned
itself with the primary place of worship; i.e. the mosque. It considers
the mosque establishment one of the most important means for achieving its
goals and promoting its principles. Mosques are fields for preaching, guidance,
political mobilization for struggle and resistance because they offer the
opportunity for gathering people five times a day.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>2- Political and informational activity</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In this respect, Hamas holds political symposiums, campaigns,
and Islamic exhibitions as well as issuing communiqu&Egrave;s, publications
and booklets.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>3- Networking through institutions</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Due to the disintegration of existing institutions in the
Occupied Territories after the outbreak of the Intifada in 1987 and the
weakness of the Israeli Civil Administration, Hamas set about establishing
what has comparatively been highly organized and effective institutions.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>4- Civil Resistance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Various civil resistance forms (demonstrations, strikes,
civil disobedience, protests, non-cooperation, etc..) have been central
to the Movement's resistance programmes and techniques.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>5- Military Action</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Since the outbreak of the Intifada, the confrontation of
Israeli occupation has gone through several stages. The following are the
main ones:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>a. Massive Civil Resistance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>b. 'The Knives War&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>With the escalation of the occupation's measures against
the Palestinian people and the decline of the role of certain organizations
in the Intifada, it looked as if the situation necessitated a move into
some qualitative action which did not depend on massive presence. Consequently,
&quot;cold steel&quot; resistance, later known as &quot;knives war&quot;,
was adopted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>c. Armed resistance</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In January 1992, the Movement's military action started
as a natural result of the occupation's terrorism against the Palestinian
people during Palestinian civil protests. The Intifada came to a point where
it was necessary to limit the amount of massive activities and to redefine
and readjust such activities so as to ease the economic and social burden
of the people. This actually paved the way for the Movement's military programme
in a time when Israelis were intensively increasing the operations of their
terrorist &quot;Death Squads&quot; to liquidate the strong nucleus of the
Intifada activists and leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On of the most important facts to be stressed here is that
there have been subjective and objective factors which contributed to the
excellence of Hamas' military performance. Remarkable among these factors
has been the independence of the military wing from the political one.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>d. Martyrs operations</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>These operations have indicated that readiness to sacrifice
oneself among Ezzedin Al Qassam militant have made them tough opponents
and ideological matches whose concepts of loss and gain are quite different
from their enemy's. What is considered a loss by the enemy is mere martyrdom
and consequent paradise for them.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Corruption: The Other Face of the Palestinian
Authority</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Khalid Amayreh</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem: On 21 March, the British daily, The
Guardian, published a shocking account of the rampant corruption engulfing
virtually all aspects of PA administration in the Gaza Strip. In fact, David
Hirst's audacious revelations were so shocking that some Gazan activists
translated the article entitled &quot;Shameless in Gaza&quot; into Arabic
and distributed it as a leaflet throughout the Strip and in some parts of
the West Bank. Moreover, a finer translation of Hirst's investigation was
aired several times by &quot;al Quds,&quot; the Damascus-based radio station
run by opponents of Yasser Arafat.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Shameless in Gaza&quot; was so candid in exposing
the moral decadence, administrative nepotism, and the overwhelming financial
corruption permeating the PA hierarchy from the very top to the very bottom.
One Palestinian journalist remarked that Hirst exposed only one aspect of
an entirely morbid body known as the PA. Another journalist envied Hirst
&quot;because he has a powerful country to protect him in case the establishment
decides to break his fingers and silence his mouth.&quot; He rightly argued
that had a Palestinian journalist indulged in this kind of &quot;dangerous
talk&quot;, he would have incurred the full wages of his folly, with punishments
conceivably ranging from &quot;condemnation to a dark cell in some notorious
Gaza jail&quot; to &quot;accidental liquidation by some overzealous Force-17
members who didn't abide by the spirit of the law.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hirst's presentation of the &quot;Tunisians, the new profiteers
of Gaza&quot;&oacute;who often &quot;use their VIP cars to sail through
Israeli checkpoints on their way to the flesh-pots of Tel Aviv...even as
Israeli border closures rob day labourers of their menial wages&oacute;did
not go unnoticed by the Palestinian intellectual community.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 12 May, the Palestinian Legislative Council (constantly
bullied by Arafat) held a long-delayed hearing on &quot;Corruption in the
Palestinian Authority&quot;, during which counsellors listened to hair-raising
stories that, in the words of one counsellor, transcended reality. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nabil Amre, apparently alluding to Hirst's article, recognized
during a seminar at Beir Zeit University on 15 May that &quot;there is widespread
administrative corruption within the PA.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amre, a close confidant of Yasser Arafat, actually stopped
short of saying that corruption was the modus operandi of the Palestinian
Authority administration. However, the man who reportedly writes most of
Arafat&iacute;s public speeches opined that the PA would be corrupt only
as much as the Palestinian people allow it to be.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amre's ostensibly valid argument, however, bears all the
features of a half-truth, since Arafat's Authority is not an exclusive Palestinian
affair. One should not forget that the PA was established first and foremost
by an Israeli-American decision, mainly to absolve Israel of the liabilities
of its continuing occupation of Palestine and to make Zionist domination
more viable and less costly. It was Israel, the United States, and the so-called
donor countries, after all, that provided Arafat with &quot;money-power&quot;
to enslave the Palestinians and that allowed him to &quot;hold all the reins,
control all the money, and make all the decisions&quot; because it is &quot;much
easier to deal with a corrupt autocratic leadership that is not accountable
to the people..&quot;</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Silence Incriminates&quot;</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For its part, the PA was so reticent about the scandalous
revelations that neither PA radio and television, nor indeed any of the
Arabic language newspapers published in Jerusalem or within the autonomous
enclave, mentioned anything about Hirst's article. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A lone exception was the Gaza-based Islamist weekly Al
Risala, which published a short column entitled &quot;The Essence of Authority.&quot;
The author (this writer) argued that the basic requirements for a modern,
healthy society (e.g. social justice, equal opportunities for all, and especially
accountability and equality before the law) were becoming all too &quot;conspicuous
antitheses&quot; of the &igrave;Sulta&icirc; (authority) of Yasser Arafat,
and that the inescapable outcome of this mischief was all too predictable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Qur&iacute;an states: &quot;God did no injustice to
them, but they were unjust unto themselves.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>The Death of Abu Dayeh Versus the PA Detention
of Kuttab</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By Ruth Anderson</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Recently, two seemingly unrelated incidents occurred&oacute;one
in Ramallah and the other in occupied Jerusalem. In the West Bank city of
Ramallah, Daoud Kuttab, a leading Palestinian journalist and a U.S. citizen,
was arrested by Palestinian police. According to Palestinian Prosecutor
General Khaled Al Kidra, Mr. Kuttab is being held pending police investigations
concerning suspicion of violating journalism regulations.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>What proves fascinating is the sudden interest of the White
House and its demands that Kuttab be immediately released. White House spokesman
Michael McCurry stated, &quot;We are very concerned about the implications
of his detention both for the rule of law and for freedom of the press.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>It is also interesting to note that Kuttab owns a television
studio funded by the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID) and
that he had been broadcasting live sessions of the Palestinian Legislative
Council in Ramallah. France is also outraged by the detention of Kuttab,
who was the winner of the International Press Freedom Award. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The reason given for Kuttab's arrest by PA police was that
he spread the word regarding Arafat's ever-expanding censorship which, by
the way, is funded with American and Israeli money, and that the PA routinely
jams radio and TV programmes.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Though his arrest was but another blunder on the part of
the PA, Kuttab is not likely to be abused in prison and his speedy release
is imminent. What is of concern here for those who speak out about the abuse
of freedom and the rule of law is the continued torture of Palestinian detainees
at the hands of Israeli interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There was no outcry about the death of one lone Palestinian
man who was savagely beaten and died during the last week in May. There
was no White House spokesman to protest the death of Khalil Abu Dayeh. There
was no official protest to the Israeli authorities concerning the brutal
murder of this man. And France, like the White House, so concerned over
the arrest of Kuttab, remained silent.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli authorities arrested Abu Dayeh during the second
week in May when he was in Jerusalem with his wife. He was allegedly trying
to steal a weapon from an Israeli soldier in Jerusalem's Old City.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 23 May 1997, Khalil Ali Abu Dayeh, 37 years old and
married with 5 children, died from wounds received from severe beatings.
He was first held in the Russian Compound Prison and Interrogation Centre
in Jerusalem and later transferred to the Givat Sha'ul Psychiatric hospital,
a move which Abu Dayeh resisted. He was again beaten on his hands, wrists
and neck. When he complained of throat pains on 21 May, he was taken to
Sharei Zedek hospital in Jerusalem. There he was tied by his feet and hands
and when he tried to resist, he was beaten until he died.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The autopsy report conducted by the Autopsy Department
of the Palestinian Authority confirmed that Abu Dayeh had been severely
beaten, that his body had sustained blows by heavy instruments, that his
feet and hands had been tied, that he had fractures in various parts of
his body, that the bones on the right side of his face had been broken by
a dull, heavy instrument, that there were deep lacerations on his right
shoulder and that he had severe internal hemorrhaging. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Where was the world when this happened? Why were there
no international protests for this crime against humanity? Had he been an
animal, animal lovers the world over would have risen in outrage at the
death of a helpless creature at the hands of madmen. Abu Dayeh was indeed
helpless and his killers were indeed madmen; the only unfortunate thing
is that though he was treated as less than human, he was not an animal and
therefore his death did not stir the passions of animal lovers nor did it
move the White House to speak out about the brutality of his death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Who cares about the non-American or little-known Palestinians
who are arrested daily and tortured by the Israeli police? Who cares if
the indigenous inhabitants of Palestine are losing their land each day to
new Jewish settlements or blatant Israeli confiscation of Palestinian property?
Who protests the unjustified curfews and closures placed on the Gaza Strip
and West Bank which really are two huge concentration camps? And how is
it that Israel is called the only Democracy in the Middle East when Palestinians
have no rights and no freedom; they are unjustly put under curfew, harassed,
beaten and tortured; and their land and their dignity are taken from them
just because they were born Palestinian?</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There will never be peace unless and until the Palestinians
are given back their freedom and dignity, the right to live in peace on
their own land and are given the chance to survive economically as well
as culturally without unjust interference. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Men like Kuttab will survive. It is men like Abu Dayeh
that we must worry about<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Zionism and the Future of Palestine</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Robert W. McGee* </FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>I read an interesting book the other day -- Zionism and
the Future of Palestine. It was written by Morris Jastrow, Jr. and published
by the Macmillan Company in 1919. It has been out of print for many years
now and is almost impossible to find. The person who lent it to me told
me that there has been a conscious effort to remove it from library bookshelves.
It deserves to be reprinted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jastrow traces the origins of Zionism and discusses its
three aspects -- religious, economic and political -- which must be sharply
differentiated from each other. Religious zionism involves the belief that
the Jews will return to Palestine. Economic zionism was aimed at ameliorating
the pitiful conditions of the Jews living in countries like Russia and Romania
without citizenship rights and subject to oppression and persecution. Political
zionism had the aim of converting Palestine into a Jewish state, which Theodor
Herzl, the founder of political zionism, claimed to be the solution to the
Jewish question.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jastrow spends some time discussing the origins of these
three aspects of</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>zionism, but the most interesting part, and the part that
is most likely to enrage ardent supporters of the Jewish state, is the section
on political zionism. He spends much of the remainder of the book discussing
the fallacies and dangers of political zionism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reform Judaism, along with the possibility of attaining
full citizenship in the west, snapped the ties between religion and nationality.
As Jews could become citizens of the western countries they moved to when
they escaped oppression in Eastern Europe, they were able to practice Judaism
while exercising their rights as citizens in a number of western states.
Political zionism involves a misinterpretation of the trend of Jewish history
over the last 2,000 years. Religion and nationality were no longer inextricably
bound together. Thus, political zionism was based on a false premise, that
religion and nationality were inseparable.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even many zionists of the time conceded that there was
no legitimate reason for having a Jewish state as long as the Jews who lived
in Palestine were guaranteed the freedom and security of the other inhabitants
of the region.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jastrow correctly predicted that the intertwining of religion
and nationality -- political zionism -- would have negative consequences.
Whereas non-Jews have only one country and one loyalty -- Americans are
American, the French are French, etc. -- Jews are seen as having split loyalties.
They are both citizens of the country in which they live and also supporters
of the Jewish state. Thus, Jews who live outside of Israel (occupied Palestine)
are seen as being less than totally loyal to the country where they reside.
This political difference adds to the anti-semitism that already exists,
just as Jastrow predicted.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As time passes it is becoming increasingly clear that Britain
did a great disservice to the inhabitants of Palestine by giving away land
that it did not own. Present-day problems can be traced to this tragic violation
of property rights, coupled with the false premise of political zionism,
which Jastrow exposed in 1919.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Religious Zionism in Focus </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Gush Emunim's popularity among Israelis grow</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>By: Israel Shahak*</FONT></I></B></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>(Part 1 of 2)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>At the time when so many politicians, political scientists
and media pundits in Western countries are busily discussing the real or
supposed dangers of Islamic fundamentalism, hardly anybody speak of the
Jewish fundamentalism, which not only exists, but also grows, in Israel
and even more in the United States. I don't mean by that the negligible
splinters of Kahanists, but the much more influential and dangerous Messianic
ideology of the religious settlers in the Territories organizationally represented
by the Gush Emunim. Unlike the Kahanist splinters, Gush Emunim is considered
perfectly respectable. On some important issues, it is supported by the
entire opposition camp in Israel (Labor and Meretz), the right-wing and
religious as well as by some influential Jewish and Christian groups in
the U.S. Although it has organized demonstrations against Yitshak Rabin,
some of its leaders remained until his assassination on 4 November, 1995,
his closest friends. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The prospects of Gush Emunim seizing power in Israel through
a coup d'etat or heavily influencing Israeli policies through a complacent
government (like the present government of Benjamin Netanyahu) is by no
means unlikely: and the reminder that Israel possesses nuclear weapons and
insists on keeping its nuclear monopoly in the Middle East is in this respect
in place. Contrary to what is usually believed, the ideology of Gush Emunim
is in my view even more extremist than the ideologies attributed to the
most extremist Islamic fundamentalist organizations. It is high time that
this ideology be more widely known than it has been so far.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Like other run-of-the-mill Israeli ideologies, the Gush
Emunim ideology is in its essentials traceable to the 1920s. It was devised
by Abraham Yitzhak Kook, the Chief Rabbi of Palestine, the most influential
supporter of religious Zionism. His followers believe he was divinely inspired
and infallible. His son and successor, Rabbi Tzvi Yehuda Kook, who died
childless at the age of 91 in 1980s, was treated with similar deference.
To all intents and purposes, his followers became a sect within Orthodox
Judaism, and that sect eventually evolved into present Gush Emunim. Following
T.Y. Kook's death, the spiritual leadership of the sect devolved into a
&quot;rabbinical council,&quot; with a membership selected by mysterious
criteria from among his disciples. The innovative tenets of their theology
are traceable to an interpretation of Jewish mysticism (the Cabala). Sine,
however the writings of both Kooks are (possibly on purpose) even more obscure
than the invariably obscure Cabbalistic literature and in modern interpretations
of both. Unfortunately, the deeper implications of all those writings are
theologically too intricate to lend themselves easily to a popular presentation
to otherwise well-educated readers. This is why such presentations are lacking,
even in Hebrew. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Gush Emunim, (G.E.) however, several good books have
appeared in Hebrew. The only on available in English is no more than fair.
It is: &quot;for the Land and the Lord, Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel,&quot;
by Ian S. Lustick, Council on Foreign Relations, 1988. As the author informs
us in his preface the book originated with a paper written for the U.S.
Department of Defense. This may partly explain the book's excessive concentration
on the political stances of G.E. and its relative neglect of invariant elements
in G.E. doctrines. Contrary to what its title suggests, &quot;Jewish Fundamentalism&quot;
is hardly explained in the book. Moreover, Lustick tends to present the
more extremist G.E. dogmas in a way that wouldn't overly shock his American
readers. Fortunately, some of the material missing from Lustick's book can
be found in &quot;Israel's Fateful Hour&quot; by Yehoshafa Harkabi (Harper
&amp; Row, 1988), specifically its chapter &quot;Nationalistic Judaism.&quot;
Later, I will quote much from these two books. First, however, I am going
to discuss the contents of the original Hebrew literature in my own words,
without bothering to attribute each mentioned idea to a specific source.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before discussing its political implications, let me begin
with some fundamentals of Rabbi A. Y. Kook's theology as interpreted by
Gush Emunim. That theology is both eschatological and Messianic, in that
it assumes the imminence of the coming of the Messiah, from when the Jews
aided by God will triumph over the Gentiles and rule over them (for the
latter's own good) for ever and ever. Consequently, all current political
developments can be seen through by those in the know ( the leaders of the
sect), as destined to bring this end sooner, or postpone it in time. Specifically,
Jewish sins, particularly the lack of faith as the worst of them, can postpone
the coming of the Messiah. Not for long, though; even the worse sins of
the Jews cannot alter the predestined course of Redemption. All they can
do, is to increase the sufferings befalling the Jews prior to its occurrence.
The two world wars, the Holocaust and other calamitous events of modern
history serve as stock examples of such a curative punishment. Such explanation
can go into much specific detail. One of the best known rabbis from the
mentioned &quot;rabbinical council&quot; of Gush Emunim, who also serves
as the rabbi of Kiryat Arba and who eulogized the mass murderer Baruch Goldstein
at his funeral, Dov Lior, had attributed Israel's relative failure in its
1982 invasion of Lebanon to the lack of faith manifested by signing peace
with Egypt and &quot;returning the inheritance of our ancestors (i.e. Sinai)to
strangers.&quot; The odder such explanations are, the more readily tend
they be accepted by the sect. In the Cabalistic doctrine, the nearer the
redemption is, the more incomprehensible its portenus must appear to the
uninitiated. It is because the power of the Satan (i.e. of the Gentiles)
can be defeated only by acting bizarre. (the Satan of the Cabbala is conceived
of as rational and well-versed in logic). the same logic was quite common
in the past Jewish movements of the same type, for example in the world-wide
movement of the false Messiah Shabtay Sevi (1665-66) or in the early Hassidism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The thus-far presented ideas are derived from the tradition.
There are, however, some innovations as well. One concerns the concept of
Messiah. The Bible anticipated a single Messiah, Jewish mysticism anticipated
already two of them, but G.E. anticipates a collectivity of Messiahs. According
to the original Cabalistic doctrine, the two Messiahs will differ in character.
The first, a militant figure, called &quot;the son of Yoseph,&quot; will
have the task to prepare the material preconditions for the Redemption.
The second Messiah will already be the spiritual &quot;son of David&quot;
redeeming the world by spectacular miracle-making. Still, the two Messiahs
of the Cabbala were conceived of as individuals. Rabbi A. Y. Kook altered
this notion by identifying &quot;the son of Yoseph&quot; with the group,
namely with his own followers. Along the same line of thinking, Gush Emunim
perceives itself (or the two divinely ordained Messiahs. True, this fact
cannot be revealed to the uninitiated until the conditions become ripe.
Therefore, the Gush Emunim cannot be under its infallible Divine guidance.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The second innovation concerns the relation of the first
Messiah to the ignorant and unbelieving Jews. In this matter, rabbi A.Y.
Kook's doctrine draws upon the Biblical prophecy that the &quot;salvation
bringing &quot; Messiah will be &quot;riding upon an ass, and upon a colt
the foal of an ass&quot; (Zecharia, 9.9). In Cabbala this verse was regarded
as a &quot;proof&quot; that there will be two Messiah: one riding upon an
ass and the other upon a colt. But rabbi A.Y. Kook faced a problem: how
can a collective Messiah ride upon a single ass? He solved it by identifying
the ass with the secular and indifferent Jews. It is upon them that the
collective Messiah will ride, which means that he will exploit them for
material gains, while at the same time redeeming them, at least to the extent
to which they are capable of being redeemed. But just as the Messianic ass,
given its low place in the hierarchy of beings, is and must remain ignorant
of the noble purpose of its divinely inspired rider, so Gush Emunim matters
more than the remainder of the Jewish nation by virtue of its exclusive
access to the Divine truth. The rider leads the ass toward salvation given
this noble purpose, he may well deliver some kicks en route to make sure
the ass does not stray from the path. In this way Gush Emunim has to deal
with ass-like Jews, stubborn enough to refuse to renounce their beastly
habits and concerns and to embrace the True faith.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The last innovation of rabbi A.Y. Kook to be discussed
here is the one which has most decisively contributed to the growth of popularity
of Gush Emunim. It concerns the conduct of the elect throughout the Redemption:
in relation to other Jews, in relation to Gentiles and in relation to the
worldly concerns in general. Rabbi A.Y. Kook taught that the elect should
not stand aloof from the rest of the world. True, the rest of the world
was sinful and Satanic in its nature. But the task of the elect was to bridge,
to the extent possible the gap between themselves and the rest of society
by involving themselves in the latter and thus sanctifying it. This doctrine
has since the 1920s deeply influenced the behavior of his followers and
was reasserted with added vigor by Gush Emunim after 1924.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Unlike the Orthodox Jews until then, rabbi Kook's followers
began to dress like the seculars, except for wearing a minimal-size skull
cap. At this time, they tend to follow the Israeli secular clothing fashion
of the 1950s. Likewise, their schools introduced large portions of perfectly
secular teaching matter into their curricula. Rabbi Kook insisted that fighting
and training oneself to fight was a religious duty. Faithful to this teaching,
Gush Emunim includes large numbers of officers from select units of the
Israeli army. Special army units comprised of the students of G.E.'s Yeshivot
are renowned for their excellent combat qualities, for their high motivation
to fight, And for a relatively high casualty rate in the Lebanon war. In
a society as militaristic as the Israeli Jewish one is, this attitude won
G.E. wide public sympathy.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For this and other reasons G.E. is respected highly by
the right-wing Israeli Jews. Labor electorate once had some respect for
G.E., but eventually G.E. managed to antagonize it badly by demanding that
Lebanon be annexed &quot;as a part of the heritage of our ancestors, the
tribes of Asher, Naftali and Zebulon&quot;, and in general by supporting
policies even more hawkish than those of Sharon. For example, G.E. opposed
vehemently Sharon's 1982 alliance with the Falangas, on the ground that
the latter were Christians, and therefore &quot;idolaters.&quot; G.E. believes
that in the Messianic age the Jews should in their conquests rely on God's
help alone. Alliance with infidels could incur the risk that God would withhold
His help as a retribution. An instructive example of the cosmic nature of
such beliefs was provided by Daniel Ben Simon, a staunch labor supporter,
(Davar,&quot; February 27, 1994) after the massacre perpetrated by Goldstein.
Ben Simon quoted an &quot;explanation&quot; provided by a member of the
Jewish Underground, after its members were arrested by the Shabak in the
spring of 1984, having been caught red-handed while laying bombs under Arab
houses, timed to explode at the beginning of Sabbath (so as not to injure
any pious Jews), and at the same time planning to blow the AL Aksa Mosque.
the &quot;explanation&quot; is traceable to G.E. sources. &quot;While interrogating
one 'Jewish Underground' member, Shabak men were stunned by the downright
satanic idea under girding the plan to demolish the Muslim mosques on the
Temple Mount. As the man explained to his interrogators, 'the demolition
of these mosques would have infuriated the hundreds of millions of Muslims
in the entire world. Their rage would inevitably lead to a war which in
all likelihood would escalate into a world war. In such a war the scale
of casualties would be formidable enough to promote the process of Redemption
of the Jews and of the Land of Israel. All the Muslims would by then disappear,
which means that everything would be ready for the coming of the Messiah'
&quot; Such doctrines were unpalatable even for the worst hawks of Labor,
who as a consequences lost all respect they once had for G.E.'s distinguished
fighters.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>But G.E. is increasingly loathed by Laborites and left-wingers
also for other reasons. One of them, which appeared already after the Oslo
Accord and Goldstein's massacre, was the belated disclosure of the tight
control the G.E. rabbis exercise over it and of their contempt and hatred
for secular Jews who dare disobey the Divine Will as revealed to them. The
Association of Judea and Samaria Rabbis, which rules the Gush Emunim settlers
was described by Dov Elbaum on January 7, 1994 (Yerushalayim&quot;), who
thus quotes one of that Association's members, rabbi Daniel Shilo from the
settlement of Kedumim: &quot;The Judea and Samaria Rabbis at present solve
the gravest problems the settlers face when they begin to lose faith in
Jewish settlement in Judea and Samaria as conducive to Redemption. Some
Jews who lack faith begin even to ponder whether the whole idea of settlement
might not be fundamentally wrong or whether the process of Divine Redemption
is not in its retrogression stage, or whether the Almighty is not trying
to signal to us that we salt the settling. In such a moment, the rabbis
have the duty to provide the answers. This is why we, the rabbis, have now
more power than any conceivable lay authority. By virtue of our spiritual
influence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village stood on flat terrain on the central coastal
plain, on the north side of a highway leading to Jaffa. [Kana'na and Abd
al-Hadi 1986:31] The inhabitants believed that their village was narned
after Salama Abu Hashim, a companion of the Prophet Muhammad, who was buried
in the village in A.D. 634. His tomb, on the northwest side of the village,
became known as the shrine of Sayyiduna (our master) Salama. [ibid.:9, 311
In 1596, Salama was a village in the 7wahiya of Ramla (liwa' of Gaza) with
a population of ninety-four. It paid taxes on a number of crops, including
wheat and barley, as well as on other types of property such as goats and
beehives. [Hut. and Abd.:1541 The Syrian Sufi traveller al-Bakri al-Siddiqi,
who traveled in the area in the mid-eighteenth century, visited the above-mentioned
shrine. [Al-Rihla, cited in al-Khalidi 1968:152] In the late nineteenth
century, Salama was a village built of adobe brick and had a few gardens
and wells. [SWP (1881) 11:254]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>During the British Mandate, Salama was divided into quarters,
each quarter inhabited by a hamula (clan) or sub-clan. The houses were at
first clustered together, with the houses of each hamula or sub-hamula centered
around a large courtyard (hawsh) that had a single common entrance. The
courtyard provided private space for women to do their household chores,
for children to play, and for families to gather in the evening or on special
occasions. Some families also built houses in the orchards; these did not
usually belong to hamulas. Although most houses were constructed of adobe
brick, some people built stone houses and Baghdadi houses, which were made
of wood and insulated with gravel and whitewash on the inside. [Kana'na
and 'Abd al-Hadi 1986:30, 35] The population was comprised of 6,670 Muslims
and 60 Christians. Salama had two elementary schools, one for boys and another
for girls. The boys' school was opened in 1920 and the girls' in 1936; 504
boys and 121 girls were enrolled in 1941. The villagers also supported a
soccer team.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There were numerous shops in the village, including five
coffee shops. During the Mandate, a transportation company that owned cars
and buses was established in Salama, with partners from the neighboring
village of al-'Abbasiyya; the company was called the Salama-al-'Abbasiyya
Automobile Company. [Kana'na and 'Abd al-Hadi 1986] The villagers worked
primarily in agriculture and associated activities, and to a much lesser
extent in commerce and the civil service. In 1944/45 a total of 2,853 dunums
was devoted to citrus and bananas and 2,266 dunums were allocated to cereals;
370 dunums were irrigated or used for orchards. Agriculture was both rainfed
and irrigated; irrigation water was drawn from some eighty-five artesian
wells. [Kana'na and 'Abd al-Hadi 1986:32] The residents shipped their produce
in Jaffa and sold some of it in nearby Zionist settlements. They also shipped
milk to a dairy factory in Jaffa that was owned by two men from Salama.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupation and Depopulation</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Salama was hemmed in by a number of Jewish settlements
and came under almost continuous attack for a period of five months, beginning
on 5 December 1947, a week after the passing of the United Nations Partition
Resolution. The New York Times reported that members of the Haganah opened
fire with machine-guns at Salama on that date and that Arab families were
evacuating the area and moving towards al-Ramla and Lydda. The Palestinian
newspaper Filastin reported a twopronged attack on the same date, which
abated when British police arrived and later resumed during the night. Sniping
and further attacks were reported over the following two days. The History
of the Haganah states that in December 1947 &quot;the Haganah leadership
in Tel Aviv decided to attack the infamous village of Salama,&quot; adding
that &quot;this was the first attack on an Arab village.&quot; The assault
was carried out at dawn on 19 December and was unsuccessful. Palestinian
historian 'Arif al'Arif mentions another raid on 28 December and writes
that it was preceded by a diversionary attack from the settlement of Petach
Tiqwa. The raid originated at Ramat Gan, where the Zionists had assembled
a large force drawn from the Jewish Settlement Police and the Irgun Zvai
Leumi (IZL). The village's defenders managed not only to drive the attackers
back, but mounted a counteroffensive against Petach Tiqwa, where they were
joined by militiamen from Lydda and al-'Abbasiyya. [F:6/ 12/47, 7/12/47,
8/12/47; NYT:6/12/47, 11/1/48; R:274-79; S:1379]</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In early January 1948, the villagers had set up various
makeshift defenses around Salama. The New York Times reported on 11 January
that British army units had used gunfire to clear four roadblocks around
the village and had told the makhtar to make the people fill in a large
ditch &quot;presumably intended as a defense measure.&quot; Filastin described
the same incident, adding that the army justified its actions by saying
that it needed to move freely through the area. The defensive barriers were
evidently being put to good use, since Filastin reported no less than ten
separate attacks on the village in the month of January alone, sometimes
more than one in a single night. [F:11/1/48; NYT:11/1/481</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Zionists believed that Salama provided shelter for
nonlocal guerrillas, but al-'Arif writes that it was the villagers themselves
who organized a militia of around 30 men, in the wake of the UN Partition
Resolution in November 1947. After that, scarcely a day went by without
a skirmish around the village, during which &quot;bullets rained down&quot;
upon Salama. On 18 January 1948, Israeli historian Benny Morris records
a major Zionist attack on the village, by the Third Battalion of the Alexandroni
Brigade. The operational orders for the January operation stated: &quot;The
aim is . . . to attack the northern part of the village of Salama ... to
cause deaths, blow up houses and to burn everything possible.&quot; A qualification
was added: &quot;Efforts should be made to avoid harming women and children.&quot;
According to Morris, numerous houses were destroyed in the January attack.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The largest attacks that occurred in subsequent weeks and
which were reported by various sources were carried out on 28 February and
15-16 April. The Arab Liberation Army sent 20 fighters to join in the defense
of Salama during the first attack. Reporting on that attack, the New York
Times indicated that the Haganah had &quot;invaded&quot; Salama, and the
attack was only revealed the following day when British police discovered
the bodies of 6 Jews killed during the attempted invasion. A communique
issued by Arab militia forces based in the area said that a force of 250
Jewish troops participated in the first attack, including an advance party
of 50. It added that the 6 Jews killed were part of the latter force, which
was surrounded by the village's defenders. The communique, published in
Filastin, said that 3 Arabs were also killed in the battle, including 1
woman. In the second attack, al-'Arif writes, at least 30 three-inch mortar
shells rained down on the village from Jewish positions at Petach Tiqwa.
[F:2/3/48; NYT:1/3/ 48, 29/4/48; R:274-79; S:1379, 1502; M:1571</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The attacks persisted into the second half of April, but
the village defenders soon ran out of ammunition, and the residents began
to leave. The village was not occupied, however, until the end of April,
during Operation Chametz (&quot;Passover&quot;; see Bayt Dajan, Jaffa District)
which aimed at the encirclement and occupation of Jaffa. [M:157; R:274-79]
Units of the Alexandroni Brigade occupied Salama on 29 April 1948. [S:1574-75]
Morris quotes the Haganah radio as saying that the village was evacuated
&quot;at the first onslaught,&quot; but al-'Arif states that Jewish forces
did not enter Salama until they had made sure that it had been evacuated
by its residents. Al-'Arif writes that the village was empty by 30 April,
and a Times dispatch indicates that Salama surrendered to the Haganah on
that day. Later that day, Salama was visited by Jewish Agency chairman David
Ben-Gurion, who wrote in his diary that he found &quot;only one old blind
woman.&quot; Morris states that the villagers were scattered among various
locations, some going to the Ramallah and Nablus areas, others to Gaza and
Jordan. [M:100; NYT:29/ 4/48, 1/5/48; R:274-79; S:1553]</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Settlements on Village Lands</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The village and its lands have been engulfed by the expansion
of Tel Aviv.</FONT></P>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>The Village Today</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A number of village buildings remain: numerous houses,
four coffee shops, the mosque, the shrine, one cemetery, and the two schools
(see photos). The houses are deserted and in a state of disrepair, except
for a few that are inhabited by .Jewish families. Most are made of concrete
and exhibit a variety of architectural features. They are either one- or
twostorey buildings and have rectangular doors and windows (except for one
that combines both arched and rectangular windows). Four houses are identified
as belonging to Ahmad Muhammad Salih, Mustafa Abu Najm, Abu Jarada, and
Abu 'Amasha. The house of Abu Najm is a two-storey, concrete structure with
rectangular doors and windows (some of which have grillwork and others shutters).
It is sealed, and the outside staircase leading to its second floor is gone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The four coffee shops were named after their owners: Muhammad
al-Hawtari, Abu 'Asba, Sha'ban al-Naji, and al'Arbid. A Jewish family lives
in the al-Hawtari coffeeshop. It has an enclosed front porch and a slanted
roof covered with corrugated metal sheets; the bottom door panel has been
marked with a star of David. The domed shrine is in a state of disrepair.
One of the two village cemeteries (&quot;the martyr's cemetery&quot;) is
deserted and overgrown with wild vegetation, while the other has been turned
into a small Israeli park. Fig, cypress, palm, and Christ's-thorn trees
and cactuses grow on the site. The surrounding land is generally covered
by construction.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>&quot;Robert Fisk: Reporting the Truth and
Exposing Lies&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>by: Nader Hashemi</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><B><I><FONT SIZE=+1>Nader Hashemi is the co-ordinator of the Carleton
University Middle East Discussion Group. He is an active member of several
human rights and solidarity groups related to the Middle East and Bosnia-Hercegovina.</FONT></I></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Veteran Middle East correspondent Robert Fisk spoke to
a capacity crowd of 350 in Ottawa, Canada last month on the topic &quot;Threats,
Lies and Videotape: Reporting the Middle East.&quot; His lecture could have
alternatively been titled: &quot;Honesty and Moral Integrity: Reporting
the Middle East.&quot; With a penetrating oratory style and flawless English
diction, he spoke for one hour and 45 minutes drawing upon his 30 years
as a professional journalist, 21 of which have been spent reporting from
the Middle East and North Africa. His presentation was a blend of history,
humour, personal anecdotes and solid analysis. Fisk who holds has a PhD
in Politics from Trinity College, Dublin, is the author of the 60,000-selling
and widely acclaimed book, PITY THE NATION: LEBANON AT WAR, and has the
distinction of being the longest serving Western correspondent in the region.
His talk was a reflection on both the changing nature of his profession
and the restrictions placed on news reporting from the Middle East. It was
interspersed with live video footage from his 1993 documentary &quot;From
Beirut to Bosnia&quot; and never seen before raw film from the Israeli massacre
in Qana, south Lebanon.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Theorizing about recent changes journalism, Fisk lamented
the &quot;geographical shrinkage&quot; of his profession &quot;firstly because
it diminishes our world, turning ideas into government inspired certainties,
locking us into the straight-jacket of think tanks and institutes that expound
simple north-south, east-west perspectives. State Department correspondents
now tell us . . how the international community -- formerly the 'Free World'
-- should behave, how Russia is too big to be shunned over the bloodshed
of Grozny, ... how Bosnia does not -- and later does -- represent a US national
interest, how the Middle East must seize the unique, not-to-be-repeated
offer of an American-Israeli peace. And secondly, I hate the way,&quot;
Fisk continued, &quot;in which this geographical shrinkage is flattening
out history, smoothing out the creases of the historical record so that
humiliation and political treachery are turned into 'age-old hatreds', so
that reasoned opposition to a flawed peace treaty is turned into 'support
for terrorism'.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A major part of his address was directed toward criticizing
the impact of sound-bit technology. &quot;How odd it is, these days,&quot;
Fisk observed, &quot;to find our perspectives narrowed rather than broadened
by an increase of knowledge. How strange is our desire -- in the short,
edible sound-bites of the news agency wire -- to put history into a box.
How eccentric is our wish to avoid the connections, every bit as strong
as the fibre optic cable, which bind history to us.&quot; Quoting from what
Edward Said has termed &quot;the passivity and prolonged distraction&quot;
of television viewers and what the Palestinian scholar calls the &quot;rise
of democratically- induced conformism.&quot; Fisk put forward Said's thesis
that despite the diversity and heterogeneity of the United States, &quot;it
is easy to stir up feelings of endangered patriotism and national insecurity
(Edward Said, 'American contrasts,' AL-AHRAM WEEKLY, 17-23 February 1994).&quot;
Political censorship for reasons of state, as in the 1990-1 Gulf War, where
the mainstream media, instead of challenging the state accepted censorship
as a condition of reporting, was cited as an example.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Robert Fisk listed three areas which have made reporting
the news more difficult: 1) the physical danger due to an increase in the
sophistication of modern weaponry, 2) the technical problems associated
with television whose &quot;technology&quot; Fisk points out is &quot;as
restrictive as the cliches of many of its reporters,&quot; and 3) the increase
power of lobby groups. Fisk spent time criticizing the intimidation and
pressure tactics of such groups &quot;who try to persuade our editors that
we are liars or racists or that we should be fired from our jobs because
we told truths which they wish to silence. Never have these organizations
been as potentially effective as they are today,&quot; he added. &quot;They
do not write or telephone to elicit information; they do so in order to
inhibit our telling of the truth.&quot; Fisk was speaking from extensive
person experience in addressing this theme. Pro-Israel groups, whom for
years have criticized his reporting, launched a frontal assault in 1994
against the US Discovery Channel after it aired &quot;From Beirut to Bosnia,&quot;
a three hour documentary where Dr. Fisk explores the reasons behind anti-Western
sentiment in the Muslim World. Their pressure and intimidation tactics were
successful in preventing a customary second showing of the documentary (see
Robert Fisk, &quot;From Beirut to Bosnia,&quot; INDEX ON CENSORSHIP, May/June
1995).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fisk was also critical of media censorship in the Arab
world. After investigating and reporting on Egypt's unfair elections and
the systematic violations of human rights by Egyptian security police, he
was attacked in the leading daily AL-AHRAM for &quot;spreading lies and
deceit&quot; and likened to &quot;a black crow pecking at the corpse of
Egypt.&quot; He showed the audience a blown up cartoon from the Bahrain
newspaper AKBAR AL-KHALEEJ, where he was depicted along with colleagues
from the BBC and THE TIMES (London) as a rabid dog and menace to society;
a clear threat against his life. Criticizing his Arab press colleagues,
he stated: &quot;They are quick to vilify Western journalists, sometimes
with very good reason. . . . But I still remember how, during the Israeli
siege of west Beirut in 1982 -- when thousands of civilians died, either
in Israeli air-raids, bombardments from the land and sea or in the Sabra
and Chatila camps at the hands of Israel's allies, not a single Arab journalist
-- newspaper or television journalist -- came to Beirut from Egypt or Jordan
or the Gulf, from Algeria, from Morocco or from Libya. . . Loud was the
rhetoric in newspapers around the rest of the Arab world. Absent were their
reporters, many of whom bowdlerized the reports that we sent out of the
besieged city to print in their newspapers.&quot; In the Gulf War they were
no better Fisk added. &quot;They lined up, as usual, behind their leaders,
wrote glowing articles about the New World Order, the perfection of American
military power or, if they were Palestinian or Jordanian or Iraqi, the moral
leadership of Saddam Hussein.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Fisk shared with his audience insight into the moral underpinnings
that inform his unique brand of journalism. &quot;Whether or not we journalists
write the first draft of history,&quot; Fisk affirmed in his crisp English
accent and scholarly demeanour, &quot;we are often the first witnesses to
history. Indeed, I believe that is what the job of a journalist should be:
to be a witness to history, to discover the truth . .and to set it down
in print so that no one can ever say: 'we didn't know, 'nobody told us'.&quot;
Further axioms of the Fiskian code of conduct include a belief in the importance
of challenging authority, investigating the powerful, and exposing the official
line put by government and state.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>And finally onto Qana. Robert Fisk was the first journalist
into the UN compound of the Fijian battalion after it was hit by proximity
shells during the height of Israel's bombardment of southern Lebanon last
year. In a moving and graphic description which brought many in the audience
to tears, he related the scene as he entered the camp. &quot;Blood ran in
streams from the gates of the United Nations' compound in which those poor
people had taken refuge. They were the gates of hell. As I walked inside,
I saw a young girl holding in her arms the body of a middle-aged man, rocking
the corpse from side to side and weeping and crying over and over 'my father,
my father.' There were babies without heads, women without arms. I will
never forget what I saw. I reported it all in my paper.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He then proceeded to tell the entire story of the Qana
massacre. The fact that he was speaking on the 18 April, exactly one-year
after the Israeli attack, made his presentation all the more poignant. &quot;For
us reporters at the time -- and the United Nations -- the truth or otherwise
of Israel's explanation -- that it never intended to hit the UN base and
its protected Muslim civilians -- rested on its denial that it could not
see where its shells were falling. But the survivors, UN soldiers and refugee
alike, all told of seeing a pilotless Israeli photo- reconnaissance aircraft
over the camp during the massacre. And if this was true, then the implication
was obvious: the Israelis knew all to well what they were doing.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>After extensive interviews with refugees and UN soldiers,
Fisk heard repeated rumours that a UN soldier at a nearby base had coincidentally
videotaped the bombing of Qana including the pilotless Israeli photo-reconnaissance
aircraft. His search for the mysterious film was in vain. He was told that
UN personnel were under strict orders not to discuss its existence with
anyone. It was two days after the mass funeral for the massacre victims
of Qana that Robert Fisk's telephone rang in his Beirut apartment. An anonymous
voice gave him a map reference and added: &quot;1300 hours.&quot; With the
audience listening intently as he recounted the story, Fisk's moving description,
which perhaps was the highlight of the evening, deserves to be quoted verbatim.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The map reference was a crossroads outside Qana. I have
never driven so fast to southern Lebanon. And at 1300 hours, I saw in the
rear-view mirror a UN jeep pull up behind me. A UN soldier in battledress
and blue beret walked up to me, shook hands and said: 'I copied the tape
before the UN took it. The plane is there. I have made a personal decision.
I have two young children,' he said, 'the same age as the ones I carried
dead in my own arms at Qana. This is for them.' And from his battledress
blouse he pulled a video-cassette and threw it on the passenger seat of
my car. It was, I think in retrospect, the most dramatic individual personal
act I have ever seen a soldier take. The mighty powers may try to cover
up but the little men can still sometimes win.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The unedited raw film clearly shows the UN base in Qana
under bombardment with the Israeli reconnaissance drone flying over head.
Fisk talked the audience through the screening pointing out the arc and
direction of the in-coming artillery shells. An Israeli helicopter is also
visible over Qana at the time of the attack, dropping phosphorous flares
to avoid heat-seeking missiles. Qana is covered in smoke as the artillery
shells rain down from the sky. At one point flames are clearly visible in
the UN base. Fisk announces pointing to the screen, &quot;There is the conference
room on fire. There are about 50 people burning to death inside that room
at the moment. This smoke,&quot; pointing to a nearby section of the screen,
&quot;is basically from the cremation of these people as the walls catch
fire.&quot; The audience sits in stoned-silence like a jury in a courtroom,
as Fisk presents his evidence with the meticulous precision and poise of
a prosecuting lawyer who convincingly demolishes the defense team's main
argument. After the video was turned off he returned to the podium and ended
his talk with the following two sentences. &quot;But here, I think, the
work of journalism must end -- and the facts of history take over. For your
kindness this evening, Ladies and Gentlemen, and for your kindness in inviting
me to Ottawa to speak to you, I thank you very much.&quot; A thunderous
applause and standing ovation ensued.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Reflecting on the evening's lecture and video presentation
I am reminded of Noam Chomsky famous admonition that &quot;it is the responsibility
of intellectuals to speak the truth and to expose lies.&quot; No reporter
lives up to that ideal better today than the Middle East correspondent for
THE INDEPENDENT, Robert Fisk. <BR>
