<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">We have been fooled!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shihadeh*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I have to admit that, at the beginning, I was not vehemently opposed to
Oslo, since out of frustration and desperation for an honorable peace, I have convinced
myself that Oslo could be the proper vehicle to achieve our national objectives. Oslo was
based on UN Resolution 242, which embodied the principle of the inadmissibility of
acquiring land by the use of force, and even stipulated a just solution to the Palestinian
refugee problem. With a proper emotional anxiety, one can easily find some strings from
these principles to create false hopes that Oslo embodies in it the final just solution to
the entire Palestinian Israeli problem. Such beautiful dreams were dashed to small
fragments against the onslaught of Israeli expansionism on the West Bank, while the
violation of our civil and human rights have become the daily motto of Zionism cruel
practices against our people, as the ugly <i>de facto</i> took over the hopes of
Oslo&#146;s <i>de jure. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us face it, the status quo cannot contribute in any manner toward an
optimistic vision for the future of peace in Palestine. The Israeli daily creation of new
facts on the grounds, by expropriation of more lands and the demolitions of more homes
cannot be construed as a step toward a final solution. The late Sharon-Natanyahu plan for
the future of the West Bank unveils a grotesque picture of the future, as
&#147;buffer&#148; zones built on Arab lands, are to be sliced off from all direction
surrounding the West Bank with super-highways connecting the 165 Jewish settlements into
Israel proper. What would be left cannot under any optimistic terminology be called a
state, or cantons for that matter, but a collection of Palestinian ghettoes dissected and
discontinued from each other by Israeli checkpoints. The final debacle would end up with
the Palestinian authority controlling less than 10% of Palestine while the Israelis would
have 90% of the lands under their cruel control. One cannot escape the irony that if
retrospectively compared to their land ownership prior to the 1948, the Jews total
ownership of the lands was less than 10%! So they have switched positions through the
biggest land grab of the 20<sup>th</sup> Century.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To pacify the disgruntled Palestinian masses an <i>interim agreement</i>
has been signed to persuade us that all Israeli violations on the ground are only
transient and could be rectified by the final status negotiations. This should legally
mean that, at the end of the final negotiations, all homes demolished would be rebuilt by
the Israelis to allow the original owners to return peacefully to their original habitat,
all land expropriated would be restored to their original owners, all evicted Palestinians
would be allowed repatriation, all super-highways would be removed to allow the continuity
of the Palestinian state and all the settlements would be dismantled, and its Jewish
inhabitants would be returned to Israel proper! That is what our naïve leadership is
trying to sell to the Palestinian masses, and here where we should draw the line that can
separate fact from fiction. To believe such parody one has to either become an ignoramus
or have &#147;faith&#148; in miracles. Israel is not going to return the expropriated
lands, nor would it, in our wildest dreams, ever entertain the thought of dismantling the
newly built settlements and highways, nor would it ever return our refugees. With the
present trend, created by our disillusionment in Oslo, we could never dream of achieving
our national objective of acquiring a viable and independent Palestinian State. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We do have other options and we should explore them and pursue them
immediately before we reach the end of our rope. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What has not been adequately exposed publicly, is the established fact
that the Palestinians hold the most powerful card for the future of the entire region, as
they alone hold the vital decision on the future of war and peace in the entire area. The
PA ostensible weak position cannot obviate the fact that without the Palestinian
cooperation, peace in the whole area could not be finalized. Without the Palestinians the
Israelis could never reach a stage of normal relations with the Arab and Moslem world, to
include political and economic cooperation. The Israelis realize that solving the
Palestinian problem could be the only bridge that can carry them across to its normal
existence as an acceptable member of the Middle East community. The Arab masses from the
Arab gulf to the Atlantic Ocean have more than a strong affinity with the Palestinian
cause and no leader would risk his own position to discourage the Palestinian from
fighting for their national rights. Jerusalem stand as a sacred city in the hearts of all
Moslems and no one would acquiesce to have it permanently subjugated under Zionist
hegemony while oppressing the indigenous Palestinians into leaving the Holy City. With
this in mind armed struggle should not discounted as a viable option for the liberation of
Palestine, as we have the resources, the determination and the enormous support of the
masses in both the Arab and Moslem world. We should never succumb to all outside pressure
to surrender our rights under the dictates of a strong oppressor. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes we do have other options, but such options could not be actuated by
simply &#147; wait and see attitude&#148; as time may not be necessarily on our side
especially if our leadership is actively participating fully with the Zionist dreams. We
need to organize in a unified front and work very hard toward such objectives. No one ever
said that liberation of our patrimony is a road full of roses, as the road is long and
more sacrifices are expected. We should learn from history that when the oppressed keep
their torch of freedom lit they would reach the end of the tunnel. We have to understand
that and make sure that Israel does too. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israel, U.S. press Arafat for further concessions</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime and the United States are expected to exert tremendous
pressure on Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat for further concessions,
particularly on such fundamental final status issues as Jerusalem and the refugees, as
well as the borders of the prospective Palestinian State on parts of the West Bank and
Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources have intimated that in return for recognizing a
Palestinian State in principle, the U.S. and Israel will demand that Arafat accede to the
Israeli &#147;red lines&#148; as repeatedly spelled out by Israeli Prime Minister Ehud
Barak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These red lines include Israel&#146;s refusal to return to the pre-1967
borders, Jerusalem remaining under Israeli control, the bulk of Jewish settlements to be
annexed and incorporated into Israel, and no repatriation or restitution for the estimated
4 million Palestinian refugees who were expelled from their homeland at gunpoint when
Israel was created over 50 years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The above-mentioned sources said the United States and Israel would make
it clear to Arafat that unless he agreed to come to terms with Israeli demands to that
effect, he would not be allowed to embody Palestinian Statehood on the ground, a step
which would further discredit Arafat in the eyes of the Palestinian people and could
ultimately bring about his downfall.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, according to the sources, the U.S. and Israel will also warn
Arafat that unless he gives in, they would seek to sever all financial and economic aide
to the Palestinian Authority as well as incite instability within the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Officially, the PA has maintained its position that the Palestinians would
not accept anything less than full Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip in
conformity with United Nations Security Council resolutions 242 and 338 as well as finding
a just solution to the refugees&#146; cause in accordance with UN resolution 149, which
grants the refugees both repatriation and restitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, PA officials have of late made a series of uncharacteristically
tough statements, insisting on the full implementation of pertinent UN resolutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, observers in Palestine contend the tough talk is only tactical in
nature and designed to extract the best possible deal from Israel, given the extremely
weak negotiating position of Arafat&#146;s regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the uncompromising statements are unlikely to reflect the
thinking of Yasser Arafat, the sole decision maker in the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And in light of Arafat&#146;s long history of giving concessions to the
Zionists in the name of &#147;safeguarding the peace process&#148; and in return for some
&#147;symbolic achievements&#148;, the Palestinian leader does not seem to warrant the
benefit of the doubt, as many Palestinian intellectuals now openly admit.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Arafat himself has only rarely spoken of the need to guarantee the
right of return for the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He instead spoke in general terms about a &#147;just and equitable
settlement of the refugee problem&#148; and whenever he mentioned resolution 194, he did
not use emphatic or strong language to ascertain that inalienable right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, there have been some extremely worrying signs leading
observers to believe that Arafat may eventually cave in to the Zionists and their American
puppets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For example, the Israeli Hebrew daily, <i>Ma&#146;ariv</i>, reported on 28
April that Arafat deposited a position paper with U.S. President Clinton recently whereby
Arafat demonstrated a willingness to compromise on the issue of refugees and borders in
return for receiving a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as its capital.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ma&#146;ariv</i> reported that the position paper, which contained 13
clauses, was a detailed draft proposal for the framework agreement with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The main gist of the proposal speaks of the PA&#146;s willingness to meet
Israel half way in everything relating to security arrangements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The paper also notes that the Palestinian leadership was referring here to
Israeli early warning stations on hilltops and other forms of military presence in the
Jordan Valley.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA is also prepared to be more flexible regarding border corrections,
which will enable Israel to annex the large settlement blocs near its borders. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As regards the refugee issue, the paper reportedly suggests that the PA
will agree to a solution which will lead to the mass return of refugees to pre-1967
Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian official Sa&#146;eb Ureikat denied the existence of such a
paper.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said during an interview with the PA-run radio station &#147;Voice of
Palestine&#148; on 29 April that the &#147;alleged document has no truth to it&#148; and
that &#147;it is likely to be another balloon test.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ureikat&#146;s thinking, however, may not and often does not reflect that
of Yasser Arafat&#146;s, who has neither confirmed nor denied the report.</p>

region <br>
without restoring the Palestinian rights</i></font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interview in Doha by Mahmoud al Khatib</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The head of the political bureau of the Islamic Resistance Movement,
Hamas, Khalid Misha&#146;al has said that Hamas is still calling for resistance as the
only option to restoring the legitimate rights of the Palestinian People.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Speaking in an interview with the <i>Palestine Times</i> in Doha last
month, Mr. Misha&#146;al strongly denied that his movement&#146;s political status was
weakened. He also criticized the optimism showed by some Arab regimes when Barak was
elected as Prime Minister in Israel. He also described his deportation from Jordan with
three other members of the Hamas political bureau as a &#147;loss&#148; but said Hamas was
not absorbed by that issue and did not consider it as its battle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following is the full text of the interview:</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Question: We notice that Hamas&#146; military and political actions have
been going backward in the last few months. Do you agree with this remark? What are the
reasons?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Answer:</b> There are certain circumstances that affect the political and
military work. There is no doubt that the military resistance of the occupation had been
targeted by the Zionist and the PA&#146;s security services alike during the last period.
There are also the hard efforts exerted by the CIA to help the Zionist and the PA security
agencies under the pretext of combating terrorism. However, there were various resistance
operations carried out by the Hamas military wing, the Ezzul-Deen Al-Qassam Brigades. Some
of these operations have been successful while some others were aborted, such as the
recent one in Al-Taibeh. All these successes support the idea that resistance is the only
option for the Palestinian People and that we are not going to give up because of these
security obstacles. As for political action, I emphasize that we are retrograding.
However, everyone can see for themselves that the Arab official arena was busy with the
prospects of the peace process during the last few months. Since Barak came to power in
the Zionist regime, some Arab officials pinned their hopes on his coming&#150;a thing that
was not based on firm ground&#150;but they were eager to get rid of the nightmares caused
by Netanyahu. Hamas has also experienced similar circumstances before. But the political
events and the nature of the Zionist conduct during this stage all enhance our conviction
that the Arab official regimes will find themselves facing hard options and that their
relying on the peace process is baseless. They will eventually reach a conclusion that the
Arab regimes and people cannot do without the resistance forces, at the top of which is
Hamas.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: It seems that the peace process is now experiencing a decisive stage.
How do you assess the future of the current negotiations between the Zionists and the PA?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> The negotiations on the Palestinian track has entered the final
stage although their substance has interfered with the remains of the transitional stage.
The Zionists have been exerting two kinds of pressure on the Palestinian Authority: the
first is by ignoring the PA under the pretext of concentrating on their talks with the
Syrians and the Lebanese in order to blackmail the PA and get more relinquishments from
it. The other is to pressure the PA in order for them to sign the &#147;frame&#148;
agreement quickly with the delay of the basic issues, especially the issues of the
refugees and Jerusalem. In order to achieve this goal, the Israelis pretend to be flexible
regarding the declaration of the Palestinian State in order to substitute for the
liberation of the occupied territories. The Zionists are now seeking to conclude a frame
agreement with the PA similar to the 1993 Oslo accords, postponing the negotiations of the
details and of the main issues to the future in order to impose their own agenda on the
PA. We are sure that the basic rights of the Palestinian People will again be the victim
of these negotiations, especially the issues of the refugees and Jerusalem.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: The PA claims that it has made achievements on the ground through the
negotiations, in particular the Israeli withdrawals from the West Bank and the Gaza Strip
as well as the indications introduced by Barak for the first time regarding his agreement
on the declaration of the Palestinian State. How do you see these achievements?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> These indications from Barak were made in order to extract more
relinquishments from the PA and to accept the Israeli demands regarding the issues of the
refugees and Jerusalem. Also, the change in the Zionist position regarding the Palestinian
State is just in appearance, but the content of this position remains the same. There is
no change in the Zionist position regarding the sovereignty on the land and on the
borders. The four &#147;NOs&#148; declared by Barak after he was elected last year have
been increased and became five during his recent visit to Washington. The newest Israeli
&#147;NO&#148; was with regard to the Palestinian refugees. He said the Zionist regime
cannot bear any moral or legal responsibility towards the Palestinian refugees and that
their problem should be solved by resettling them where they are living now and by giving
them compensation although Israel would not be responsible for paying the compensation. In
general, there are two facts regarding the current negotiations: the first is the change
in the priorities. Instead of liberating and extracting the Palestinian occupied land and
then the establishment of the Palestinian State, the PA has become busy with the
establishment of the State without having the land liberated. What is the value of this
State without land and without sovereignty? The other fact is the stereotyping of some
limited achievements in order to cover up the relinquishments given by the PA regarding
the issues of the refugees and Jerusalem. I would like to ask the Arab regimes how they
can accept such consequences that eventually lead to holding them responsible for settling
about 4.5 million refugees on their soil instead of keeping it a Zionist responsibility.
We warn of the consequences of the final status talks. The Arab and Muslim nations should
bear responsibilities towards this central issue.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: But what is Hamas&#146; programme to face these consequences?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> Hamas is concerned with enlightening its people, in the first
instance, and the Arab and Muslim people about what is going on. It is also concerned with
defending the rights of the Palestinian People represented in the issues of the refugees,
Jerusalem, the prisoners and the defending of the Palestinian land that has been
confiscated daily. We are concerned with alarming the Arab and Muslim nations in order to
bear their responsibility towards the Palestinian issue. During the last few months, Hamas
focused on the Jerusalem issue and called for the holding of an Arab and Islamic
conference to defend Jerusalem. During our meetings with the Arab officials and popular
forces, Hamas sought to mobilize an Arab and Islamic position to support the Palestinian
Cause. In addition, Hamas is still abiding by resisting the occupation despite the
difficulties it has been facing.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: You are an active organ in the Palestinian Opposition Front. Do you
believe that this Front has no role to play nowadays?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> There is no doubt that the situation of the Palestinian Opposition
is not satisfactory. But one of the merits of the Palestinian situation is that it is
moving. This leads to the conception that the Opposition factions are not the only players
in the Palestinian arena, but there are popular forces which are formed continuously and
there are also the independent figures. The Opposition factions, popular forces and the
Palestinian notables and figures all are reacting with the Palestinian different concerns
and issues such as the return of the Palestinian refugees to their homeland. This
environment is that which will produce a Palestinian situation that supports the
resistance.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: How do you see the future of the Palestinian Opposition factions based
in Damascus in case the Syrians sign a peace agreement with the Jewish State? Will this
affect Hamas when it loses important allies such as these factions?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> I don&#146;t think that any development in the talks between the
Syrians and the Israelis could lead to closure of offices of the Palestinian Opposition
factions in Damascus because any achievement on the Syrian track does not mean the
stopping of justifications of the work for the Palestinian Cause. The Palestinian People
have the right to continue their struggle regardless of any agreement signed between the
Zionist regime and the Arab parties. No one can confiscate the right of the Palestinian
People to work for their cause under all circumstances until they restore their full
rights. I also do not believe that the Syrian official position will prevent the
Palestinians from working for their cause in case a peace agreement is signed between
Damascus and Tel Aviv.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: The issue of the Palestinian prisoners in the Israeli jails is an
important human one. What is your role in solving this issue?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> There are more than 2,000 Palestinian prisoners and detainees in
the Zionist jails. Most of them belong to Hamas and are ignored by the agreements signed
between the PA and the Zionist entity. Most of those who were released from the Israeli
jails were members of the Fateh Movement&#150;the PLO mainstream faction&#150;and the
pro-Oslo organizations. I think that the Palestinian prisoners have the right to be
supported and have their cause defended by their people and the freedom-lovers because by
their sacrifices they achieved many things for their people. But the PA had ignored their
sacrifices and did not exert serious efforts to release them. Hamas has been adopting a
programme to support the Palestinian prisoners. The programme began with rallies in Hebron
last month. There will be other activities to support this cause in order to pressure the
Zionists to release them. When we talk about prisoners in the Israeli jails, we feel shame
to say that there are hundreds of Palestinians in the PA jails, especially when they have
been detained only for the interests of the Zionist Enemy. This shows that the only
achievement made by the PA is its security cooperation with the Enemy and the arrest of
its own people.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: What are the latest developments regarding your return to Jordan?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> Unfortunately, all mediations and political efforts regarding this
issue have failed. There is no explanation to this Jordanian official position except the
response to external pressures. If the Jordanian position was based on pure Jordanian
national interest, it would not take this unjustified position which rejects our return to
Amman. This position contradicts the Jordanian Constitution since we hold the Jordanian
nationality. But our case has been continued by the Jordanian Supreme Court of Justice.
During the last session of the Court, it appeared that the legal position of the Jordanian
government was weak. They [the defense lawyers] also exposed the fact that the Jordanian
government wanted to keep this case going for a long time and so they [the defense
lawyers] tried to kill it by all means.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Q: You know the Jordanian government&#146;s position rejects the presence
of Hamas leaders in Amman owing to external pressure. What is the result you are looking
for by insisting on your return to Amman?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A:</b> Whatever the Jordanian position is and whatever the pressure
exerted on it, we are talking about our rights as Jordanian citizens which should not be
confiscated because of this pressure. As Jordanian citizens, we have the right to live in
our homeland and should not be deported. Meanwhile, I want to emphasize that Hamas is not
totally absorbed by this issue. We also do not consider it as a battle to be fought. Hamas
has its own concerns and programme. It is absorbed by the concerns of the Palestinian
Cause, the Palestinian man and the developments on the Palestinian soil.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On April 14, 1948, the Irgun and Stern Gang units performed a heinous
operation in the quiet peaceful village of Deir Yassin. It was on this day that 254 men,
women and children were brutally massacred as part of Plan Dalet which went into effect
the first week of April 1948. The Dalet plan was made up of two operations, Nachson and
Havel, which were designed to occupy and destroy the Palestinian villages along the whole
length of the Jaffa-Jerusalem road. The report of the Israel Defense Forces Intelligence
Branch admitted that the massacre of these unarmed and helpless civilians was a
&#147;decisive accelerating factor&#148; of the Palestinian exodus. Israeli army witnesses
said that the Irgun and Stern Gang &#147;shot everyone they saw in the houses, including
women and children... and that &#147;the commanders made no attempt to check the
disgraceful acts of slaughter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Forty-eight years later, Israeli Prime Minister Peres, who was
paradoxically granted the Nobel Prize for Peace, ordered operation &#147;Grapes of
Wrath,&#148; a bombing blitz in Southern Lebanon, which demolished 17 villages, left more
than half a million people homeless, killed 200 and wounded several hundreds more. On
April 18, 1996, in a ruthless Israeli strike against a UN peace-keeping compound in
Southern Lebanon, the civilians who sought refuge at the UN compound in Qana, from
operation Grapes of Wrath, were shelled, resulting in the deaths of 102 people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first Prime Minister of the illegal state of Israel, Ben Gurion, had
the attitude that all Palestinians should be gotten rid of as if they were not even human.
How they were done away with was of no importance, what mattered was that they were
disposed of either by atrocious massacres or by being driven out of Palestine in mass
exoduses. The Holocaust exchanged hands. The so-called victims of Hitler&#146;s Nazi
regime became the perpetrators of even more vicious and violent crimes against humanity.
The difference was that the media, now controlled mostly by Zionists or Zionist
sympathizers became either totally oblivious to the genocide of the Palestinians or
completely circumvented accurate coverage of what was going on. They were aided by
American dollars, American lack of interest and the greed/ignorance of Arab leaders who
basically were out to make certain their little kingdoms or dictatorships survived even at
the cost of losing the Holy Land and the lives or well being of the indigenous inhabitants
of this Land of Honey. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli military commander responsible for the Qana attack said, <br>
&quot;We did our duty. They deserve to die because they are only Arabs.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An Israeli soldier told &quot;Kol Ha'Irr&quot;, an Israeli magazine,
&quot;I obeyed the orders. My conscience does not bother me at all. We should have fired
more shells to kill more Arabs . . . One Arab more, one Arab less, you know. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the battery commander said, &quot;Anyway, there are millions of
Arabs.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is difficult for the rational mind to justify the fact that the
oppressed have become the oppressors. What is more amazing is the oppressed do such a
splendid job of oppressing. What is shocking is that they perform their atrocities by
classifying them as campaigns to wipe out terrorism, or to surgically remove threats to
the security of Israel when in reality, it is merely a campaign to gain more Arab land at
the expense of Arab civilian lives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Women and children are not the enemies of a heavily armed military
machine. Ambulances carrying the dead and wounded are not guided missiles but vehicles of
mercy. Yet, such an ambulance in Qana was shelled, killing all those inside who were being
rushed to the nearest hospital for emergency treatment. The same thing applies to those
innocent civilians of the peaceful village of Deir Yassin. They were the enemies of no
one. They had committed no crime. They were not even aware that on one Spring day when
life held so much promise, their lives would be so brutally taken away from them. And no
one was spared, not a woman, nor a child and especially not any adult male. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What the Qana of April 1996 in Lebanon and the Deir Yassin of April 1948
in Palestine, have in common is the ruthlessness of an Israeli conscience that does not
even exist. And after all, what is one more Arab killed? There are millions of them! </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Americans experience the pain of remembering</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Ray Hanania*</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is a tradition in the Arab world of &#147;remembering&#148;. We
often commemorate events of tragedy that have occurred in our national lives.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The list of tragedies is long. Deir Yassin in Palestine in 1947 witnessed
more than 100 civilians butchered by Zionist terrorists who later became Prime Ministers
of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There were many subsequent massacres of Palestinians orchestrated by
Israelis as recent as a few years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many Americans don&#146;t relate to that experience. They tend to want to
commemorate &#147;positive&#148; events, such as holidays and national achievements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, in recent years, they have been forced to reconcile pain and
suffering. And they are coming closer to understanding why the Arab world commemorates
tragedy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just this month (April), for example, there were two big commemorations.
One concerned the year-old anniversary of the massacre at Columbine High School in
Littleton, Colorado, carried out by two fellow students. The killers&#150;kids who were in
their early teens&#150;worshipped Adolph Hitler and the Nazis and planned their murderous
rampage to take place on Hitler&#146;s birthday, 20 April. In a rampage that lasted about
an hour, the two &#147;kids&#148; murdered 12 fellow students and a popular teacher. They
even recorded a videotape before the attack to explain their disdain for their fellow
students who, they complained, bullied, badgered and mocked them in school. (Bullying
others is an American tradition, although it is no justification to murder innocent
people.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And then there was Oklahoma. It&#146;s been five years since Americans
went berserk blaming &#147;Arabs&#148; for the worst terrorist attack since George
Washington levelled a fort manned by British soldiers in the eighteenth century. It was
exactly five years ago the same week that two Americans plotted and then blew up, in a
massive explosion that rocked this &#147;heartland&#148; city, the Alfred P. Murrah
Federal Building. The explosion ripped apart the multi-storied building, tearing away
nearly half of it and exposing its inner-office rooms and dwellings. The image of the
bombed-out Murrah Federal Building so closely resembled building&#146;s destroyed in
numerous American bombing raids n Beirut, Lebanon, that at first, when I saw it, I thought
we were witnessing another American-led attack against an Arab target.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But, alas, despite the anti-Arab hysteria that reached a frenzied
crescendo, it turned out that the vicious, blood-thirsty, murdering baby-killers turned
out to be Americans after all. Yes. When the dust settled in Oklahoma and media
commentators from around the country had called for the arrest and murder of Arabs and the
bombing of Arab countries and cities finally stopped screaming for blood, the truth came
out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabs didn&#146;t do it, like everyone wanted to believe and thought.
Americans did it. Just like they have done it in hundreds of other countries that
Americans don&#146;t feel are worth their time remembering at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Middle Americans with names like Timothy McVeigh and his accomplice Terry
Nichols were arrested by accident. A police officer noticed McVeigh&#146;s car had a
faulty turn signal and he pulled him over. Smelling the strong odour of the chemicals used
in making explosives, the officer searched the vehicle. And in a singular moment of
enlightenment for an American, this Oklahoma officer realized that the driver, a non-Arab,
was in fact involved in the explosion. The blast killed 149 adults and 19
children&#150;crushed the same way Iraqi babies must have died during the American-led
attack on Baghdad many years earlier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While the Columbine students were commemorating Hitler&#146;s birthday,
McVeigh and Nichols were commemorating the 19 April 1993 attack against the weird
inhabitants at Waco, Texas. There, federal authorities attacked a commune of religious
fanatics who did not want to surrender their weapons. David Koresh and more than 60 people
died in the gun battle the federal authorities initiated, burning the building with all
its inhabitants, including the children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The entire American nation took pause for the innocent American lives that
vanished during the two tragedies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The name Qana, Lebanon, has meaning to the Arab people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 18 April 1996, Israel attacked Lebanon, again. Using American-made
weapons, Israeli soldiers, with fresh paychecks funded by American taxpayers, blasted
their way into the civilian village of Qana.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More than 17 high-impact shells, made by the United States, landed on a
United Nations base that was protecting Arab civilians that had fled the brutal Israeli
assault. When the smoke cleared, as it eventually did at the Murrah Federal Building, more
than 106 men, women and children were dead. Men, women and children. Mothers, fathers,
sisters, brothers. Children. Infants. Babies. All dead. And not one American thought it
worthy to stand up and say they were sorry.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I understand the pain of Columbine and Oklahoma City, more than the
American people could ever understand. I know it better than them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks in large part to Americans and their allies, the Arab world has
experienced some of the most grisly acts of carnage and killings that have been committed
on this planet. We know what it&#146;s like to remember tragedy. We&#146;re sorry you
finally know what it&#146;s like, too. But you don&#146;t make it easy to feel sorry for
you.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You make movies and documentaries, and the American media gives it such
detailed coverage. But when it comes to an Arab death, little is said. Little is reported.
Little is documented.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There&#146;s little more I can say.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">JUSTICE FOR ALL?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Fatima Hamilton</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In today&#146;s world, we hear many people expounding upon human rights
and desiring to punish war criminals. We find that people want justice. At least they say
they want justice. Yet, justice has a double-standard, depending on what part of the world
one lives in and in whose &#147;camp&#148; he resides in. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>We always hear in the news of Jews being compensated by
Germany&#150;and now Switzerland and France&#150;for the atrocities of the Second World
War. France and Switzerland aim to compensate the victims or their families for the assets
that their banks and corporations took from them during the war. We find there are many
films and books concerning of the Holocaust. Always the Jew draws pity. Well, the
Holocaust was indeed pitiful and it is a crime for any human to suffer such atrocities.
Yet, in the midst of these reparations to apologize and to compensate the Jews, the world
has forgotten that others also suffered at the hands of the Nazis, such as Gypsies and
Poles, among others. Where&#146;s their compensation? </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>If we really want justice for all and for atrocities committed
decades ago, then we must be fair to all victims. Justice is supposed to be for all
people. The United Nations created the &#147;Declaration of Human Rights&#148;, which many
countries must not know about. So, if the West, and others, claim to desire justice, then
all victims of unfairness must be compensated. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The Native American Indian should receive reparations from the
United States Government because they stole their land and tortured their people; even
today, they are not totally well-treated, and those still living on reservations live in
bad conditions. Black Americans should receive compensation because they were enslaved for
centuries by America, as well as by other countries. Africans, Arabs and Indians should
receive compensation as a result of the atrocities they&#146;ve suffered at the hands of
the British, the French and the Italian occupations of their lands during the times of
colonialism. Japan should receive reparations from the United States and Europe for the
atomic bombs that were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki which killed innocent women,
children, elderly and handicapped. Where was America&#146;s mercy? If they were following
the Jewish tradition from the Torah of &#147;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth,&#148;
then they went too far; they took a whole limb for a tooth. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>What about Serbia&#146;s genocide and ethnic-cleansing that was
carried out in Bosnia and Kosovo? Where&#146;s the reparations for these poor, defenseless
people who suffered the loss of lives and peace of mind? Their lives have been torn apart.
Their women were raped and damaged psychologically. Children witnessed horrors that may
have damaged them forever. Can these people ever learn to live a normal life? </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>What about Chechenya now? Who will defend them? After the war is
finished, who will compensate them? Besides, where&#146;s the World now? They went to
Kosovo but forgot about Chechenya. Maybe they are afraid of losing their Russian business
market and their political ally. Maybe they are too afraid of Russian nuclear weapons. The
Chechen rebels are braver than the rest of the world. The West must enjoy dealing with
Russian criminals. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Then, we look at Palestine and South Lebanon. Who will help them
overcome Israeli atrocities? Will anyone compensate the Palestinian refugees who are
scattered throughout the world? Will they ever have a home? Will they ever have an
official identity? Will the world ever stop their suffering and torture that Israelis
daily inflict on them? Will those who have been damaged psychologically and physically
ever get their rights, and who will compensate their losses? Who?? </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Isn&#146;t it funny how the Jews once suffered and now that they
have created Israel, out of someone else&#146;s land, they inflict the same wounds and
beyond that upon another people? Is this right? Is this justice?? If they wanted peace
with the Palestinians, and Arabs in general, they could have achieved it a long time ago.
They are just playing games and buying time in the hope of the world eventually forgetting
the truth and forgetting that there are a Palestinian people who need justice. The
so-called peace they have signed agreements for only exists on paper. These Israelis carry
in their hearts historical baggage of revenge and hate, and they&#146;re willing to avenge
it on others. Is this fair? Of course not! One should treat others as he wants to be
treated. When will the world ever understand true justice and really live up to its
philosophy of &#147;Justice for all&#148;?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">American Foreign Policy and the Art of
Demonization</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud</i></b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the United States&#146; primary assets in influencing and shaping
world politics is its mastery of the art of propaganda. The use of propaganda resulted in
great success during and after the Second World War. The United States, which left the war
with few scars and a greater say over global politics, developed its own propaganda and
turned this practice into a leading variable in its foreign policy outlook.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While there appears to be little disagreement regarding the legitimacy of
U.S. democracy, one cannot deny that in many ways mainstream U.S. media unquestioningly
agrees with and supports the government&#146;s stand on many world issues. Such an
attitude is often applicable in war times, when it becomes a national duty to eliminate
disagreements and side with the government, regardless.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many years later, the U.S. enhanced the borrowed art, added and deducted
accordingly to make it fit with the changing political environment. By far, the art of
demonization is the United States&#146; most unique and most effective technique of them
all. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Starting in the early 1950s and escalating to the present and presumably
for many years to come, the U.S. tends to view its worldwide conflicts in terms of
individual fanaticism rather than nations&#146; choices. When Jean Bertrand Aristide, for
example, was elected president of Haiti in December of 1990 by a 67% landslide victory,
the U.S. viscously rejected the Haitian majority choice. The U.S., which supported
Aristide&#146;s opponent Marc Bazin, was upset to see that all the money spent to bring
its man&#150;former World Bank official&#150;to power went to waste. The demonization
process thereafter kicked in. Immediately, Aristide was perceived as a dictator by the
American mass media, although his war on corruption and enhancement of social programmes
to benefit the poor would have, in a fairer world, drawn much more positive images of him.
Eleven months later, Aristide was removed from power through a military coup.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same political experiment conducted on the Haitians was later used on
others, although more visibly in other places. This, of course, should not imply that some
of those demonized by the American media and government were flawless and were necessarily
good. However, the American scheme attempted to isolate the fact that many of these
individuals were a mere reflection of a much larger phenomena. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why does the United States persist in using the same strategy time and
again? The benefits, from the viewpoint of the U.S., are abundant. By demonizing a person
rather than confronting the circumstances of which that person was a product, the U.S. is
able to largely downplay the question, &#147;Why are these nations opposed to the
U.S.?&#148; They can simply justify their actions by stating, &#147;As long as a leader is
evil, wicked, undemocratic, and insane, the U.S. is doing the world a favour by fighting
him.&#148; Thus, the revolution in Cuba had little to do with the U.S. abuses of the
Caribbean nation. It was Castro who was the real hurdle, it is Saddam Hussein who is
standing in the way of peace progress in the Middle East, and it is Osama bin Laden who is
stirring up unfounded and baseless hatred toward the U.S. and its favoured allies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The U.S. mastery of the art of demonization is now more successful than
ever. Many Americans, whether politically involved or not, are more often heard saying,
&#147;Why can&#146;t the government just get rid of X or Y?&#148; During &#147;Desert
Fox&#148;, an American man was stopped in the street and asked by a local TV reporter what
the government should do to combat &#147;Iraq&#146;s defiance of UN resolutions.&#148; His
reply went something like this, &#147;I think that we should bring Saddam Hussein to the
U.S., give him a fair trial, and then execute him.&#148; What is even more bizarre than
the answer itself is the fact that in many ways, that approach is nothing new in terms of
American Foreign Policy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Regardless of how we, as individuals, choose to perceive certain leaders
or key figures in world politics, we should differentiate between those who were a product
of events that effected their nations and those who are not. In the case of Osama bin
Laden, for instance, the man was certainly an expression of a phenomena that expanded as
the Untied States brought increasing harm to Arab and Muslim nations. While many choose to
fight the destructive American policy through speeches or literature, others have sought
alternative means, which some consider ethically permissible, while others find it
unjustifiable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Fidel Castro believed that Socialism was the path to follow as the
Cuban revolution aimed at reconstructing their shattered society, bin Laden found in Islam
the variables to enlighten, inspire and motivate the nations with whom he identified. The
issue therefore has little to do with &#147;radical Islam&#148;, as many claim. Islam,
however, was an available option that was left unexplored throughout the twentieth
century, while borrowed ideologies were the hot commodity in the Muslim and Arab
world&#146;s revolutionary market. The U.S., however, tends to single out individuals and
beliefs as the sole responsible component to peoples&#146; behaviour. Many are to blame
but hardly the United States&#146; blind and greedy policies around the world, which lend
a considerable helping hand to dictators, stirring up coups and devastating economies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Individuals don&#146;t last forever, but that hardly changes a thing. If
the evil of the world was bound to Hitler, Stalin, Nasir of Salvador Allende, the world
would now be a better place. Such truth is never accepted by the U.S. administration, who
has been leading an endless wild hunt for individuals and leaders throughout the years and
throughout the world. It is time for U.S. policy makers to take a realistic view of the
world and respect peoples&#146; aspirations and nations&#146; choices. If the U.S. refuses
to do so because of the &#147;goodness of its heart&#148;, it should do so if it really
values its economic interests and world ties. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Naseer Aruri*</p>

<p ALIGN="center">(2-2)</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Palestinian Strategies</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the Palestinians, the path of the single state is not a new form of
acceptable political development. It surfaced as their first program of liberation after
the 1967 occupation, namely, the democratic secular state. This program, however, which
was linked to armed struggle, was summarily dismissed before it had even been debated in
order to accommodate the Arab states' agenda of a diplomatic struggle. In fact, neither
the PLO, nor its program, has ever taken roots among the people. There were institutions
and there was rhetoric, but the money came from the Arab states. Accordingly, the
renunciation of the unitary state idea came as a quid pro quo: the PLO would scale down
its ambitions, while the Arab states would provide diplomatic and material help for a
mini, independent, Palestinian state alongside Israel. On the surface, diplomacy was
declared a great success, particularly as Israel was isolated in a world that came to
endorse Palestinian self-determination. In reality; however, it was a phyrric victory as
the endorsed Palestinian state never was actually established.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By contrast, the South Africans, who had also declared armed struggle,
continued to cling to a unitary state and to reject pressure to renounce armed struggle as
a form of terrorism. A separate independent existence was not high on their diplomatic
agenda. In the case of Palestine, the United Nations focused on the human rights of the
people under military occupation and on their right to a separate existence. But in spite
of international recognition of their right to independence, they were never able to
experience true emancipation. They continued to endure a status of refugees, of occupied
people, and of an ethnic minority in a country in which during the life time of many, they
constituted a majority of the population.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Palestinian struggle finally shifted toward the political
dimension during the Intifada, the goal of a separate independent existence remained
intact. It was, however, a struggle suited more toward empowerment and social and economic
progress than toward co-existence in a single state. Its principal goal was to make the
end of occupation not only desirable, but also manageable.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Alternative Strategies</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now that the pursuit of independence has been impeded by the structural
arrangements inherent in Oslo, the Palestinians are challenged more than ever to resurrect
the political struggle of the Intifada: building mass organizations and alternative
institutions that would enable them to cater to the social, economic, and political needs
of the populace. The on-going and ever-increasing land grab will not be halted by
diplomatic action, but will be slowed down only by mobilization and mass action.
Undoubtedly, the task is daunting, for it challenges not only Israel's occupation regime,
but the PA's authority as well, since any form of a struggle, even that designed to effect
international law principles, would be considered seditious and hence subject to
repression under the guise of fighting terrorism, guarding Israel's security, and meeting
the requirements of what Israel calls &quot;reciprocity.&quot; And yet there are no short
cuts to genuine emancipation. The privations and hardships associated with the status of
refugees, of an occupied population, and of second class citizens, will continue to retard
Palestinian political development despite all the trappings of statehood, e.g., a
President without executive power, a council without legislative powers, courts with
insignificant jurisdiction, an over-blown civilian bureaucracy prone to corruption, and a
pervasive military apparatus focused on suppressing dissent.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></b>The alternative to Oslo must guarantee the removal of disabilities
inflicted on the Palestinians in the three spheres. No degree of independence or
liberation is meaningful without removing the legal, social, and economic disabilities
that set the Palestinians apart and classify them under the three categories. This
requires a determined, systematic, and protracted struggle, which combines the three
segments of the Palestinian people, jointly with Israeli Jews who wish to be neither
master of another people, nor privileged in an apartheid system, nor colonial settlers
denying the existence of the indigenous natives or wishing their disappearance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The goal of the struggle would have to be equal protection of the law, as
in the 14th amendment to the U.S. Constitution, the illegality of any unreasonable
classification in the law, and the end of group segregation and its removal from the
social, economic, and legal fabric of society. Equality for every single human being in
Palestine/Israel would be the motto of the new struggle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, of course, is bound to collide with the interests of the major
players in Washington, Tel-Aviv, and Ramallah. For it would signal that U.S. domination of
Middle East diplomacy has failed. It would serve as an indictment of Zionism, the
classical version of Rabin, Peres, and Barak, as well as the revisionist brand of
Jabotinsky, Begin, and Netanyahu. It would serve as an indictment of the narrow brand of
Palestinian nationalism which seems either unwilling or incapable of re-examining the past
with all its errors, pitfalls, and misconceptions. Call this kind of struggle unrealistic
and the goal idealistic or utopian, but it certainly has more prospects for success than
the present open-ended formula, whose explanation continues to exact higher energies than
its application, and whose future is doomed by a grotesque disparity in power, divisions
within the respective camps, and a declared reluctance by the self-styled peace-maker to
devote any more energies to an issue that is no longer strategic or vital for the U.S.
national interest.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>Arafat's Dilemna</u></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Negotiations between Israel and the PA are like encounters between the
elephant and the fly. And now after the Clinton Administration has been put<b> </b>on
notice by Ehud Barak and Israel's congressional lobby to reduce the U.S. role in the
negotiations (as if Washington had been the PA advocate!), the weaker party has no place
to go except to its own wailing wall in Cairo. Having traded its people's legitimacy for
U.S. and Israeli legitimacy; the PLO has placed itself in a no-win situation. The ongoing
stalemate will also continue to be fueled by diviajons inside Israel, which now center not
on whether Oslo Would end the occupation and restore a measure of normalcy to Israelis and
Palestinians, hut on the most efficient and least disruptive approach to preserving the
status-quo under a more benign label. The method of repackaging the occupation is what
really divided Rabin and later Barak from Netanyahu. This fact has not been lost on a
sizable sector of the Palestinian community; inside and outside Palestine. While some
comprehend it welt others feel it instinctively, irrespective of Arafat's constant
expressions of nostalgia for and repeated devotion to Rabin's legacy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat has placed himself in the untenable position of being unable to
deliver to either Israel and its U.S. patron, on the one hand, or to his own constituents,
who were ready to scale down their aspirations but not to surrender their rights, not to
legitimize what the South Africans and the whole world have renounced -the bantustans and
apartheid. His denunciations of terror and vows to eradicate violence, under repeated
urgings by the United States and Israel, are seen in the Palestinian street as an ominous
attack on civil liberties and the right of dissent. Moreover; his assumption of
responsibility for Israel's security is becoming increasingly incontrovertible when that
security keeps on assuming an accelerated dimension that negate Palestinian rights -water
security; settlements security, and demographic security (which negates the rights of
refugees).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All of these factors confirm, prolong, and expand the stalemate. Oslo was
not designed as a normal traditional agreement. It has now become a guarantor of
disagreement and the intended legitimizer of the status quo. The Palestinians have no
other choice but to struggle for equal rights and equal dignity. Their society has been
deformed by Oslo, and their future development has been blemished by it. Not only had Oslo
foreclosed their option of a separate and sovereign existence; it has also denied them the
right to struggle for that existence, inasmuch as most variants of the struggle are bound
to be classified as either terrorism, lack of reciprocity; failure to abide by
commitments, or acting against peace.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Oppositional politics in the West Bank and Gaza will be considered as an
issue of security and law and order, despite the privileged position it occupies in
Israeli and American political life. Thus Oslo, whether managed by Labor or Likud, will
remain part of Israel's negotiating strategy calculated to put the onus on Arafat to prove
his ability as an effective gendarme for Israel, while the latter is released from the
pressure of finding a solution to its continuing occupation. Should the wave of suicide
bombings resurface, Arafat will discover that his obligation to Israeli security will
continue to dominate the diplomatic agenda and to overshadow the national rights of the
Palestinian people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is for this reason that the Israeli-supplied framework of Oslo and its
various corollaries, which irt themselves are part of Israel's negotiating strategy; have
placed Palestinian leaders in a &#147;no win&#148; situation. Arafat's deal with Israelis
predicated on an impossible equation. What Israel wants, Arafat cannot deliver without
becoming Israel's puppet and quisling.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The process that began in Oslo will reach no where because its path
relates to the nature of the Israeli state, which precludes genuine co-existence with the
Palestinian people on an equal basis. As long as the Zionist ideology of acquiring the
land without the people prevails, a negotiated settlement based on the right of the two
people to dignity and self-determination will continue to be elusive. Benjamin Netanyahu
did not repudiate Rabin's strategy; he only rejected his tactics. It should be recalled
that when Rabin diverted the negotiating venue from Washington to Oslo in 1993, he was
making an important shift away from the hardly concealed stalling tactics of his Likud
predecessor, Shamir, while creating his own gridlock that had the appearance of diplomatic
progress. In a subtle contrast to Shamir, Rabin opted for an agreement with a built-in
conflict over meaning and objectives. It is because of that gridlock and the built-in
conflict, that the Oslo process was born in a stalemate and continues to be stalled.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Segmenting the Palestine question by issues, population categories,
regions, towns and villages, and stages of negotiations has thus far constituted one of
the biggest obstacles to peace. Had the issue of land and settlement not been deferred,
the question of settlement security would not have become a barrier for redeployment. Had
the issue of Hebron not been singled out and also deferred, the question of
&quot;further&quot; redeployment would not have arisen. Had the issues of Jerusalem and
sovereignty not been put off, the violence associated with the closure, the tunnel, Ras al
Amoud, Abu Ghneim (Har Homa) would not have replaced them as root causes on the agenda of
the &quot;honest broker.&quot; Had the deferral pattern not been set, matters relating to
self-governance, further redeployment, easing the closure, releasing tax funds, and even
resuming negotiations would not have been treated as probationary. Could such a
self-defeating process be meant for real implementation?</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u>A</b> <b>Reconsideration of Zionist Ideology?</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Any forward movement beyond the present no peace - no war situation would
require a debate on Zionist ideology and history, in which the difficult questions,
suppressed since the establishment of Israel, would surface. At the heart of the debate
would be the main Zionist narrative, its negative portrayal of Arabs and its distortion of
history and the requirements of peace. Already, we are told, a post-Zionist debate is
taking place inside Israel. The question is how extensively has it been followed by the
general public. Political scientist Ilan Pappe' has written a series of studies on this
post-Zionist critique and its manifestations in the various Israeli cultural products,
including films, plays, music, novels; and short stories, as well as in the scholarly
discourse. Pappe's writings reveal how intertwined the lives of Israelis and Palestinians
have become. There is an implication in his work that Israel cannot prosper as an isolated
Western outpost in the region. A democratic pluralist Israel as a part of the
Mediterranean is also an Israel with many historical narratives. Such an Israel has a
chance at a common future.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The question of whether Zionism is a movement of national plundering or a
movement of a persecuted people acting according to a human ethic, seeking compromise and
peace, is being increasingly raised by Israeli intellectuals. The historian Benny Morris
framed the question in terms of the accuracy of the &quot;Zionist ethos claims that we
came to this land not to exploit the natives and expel them, and not to occupy them by
force.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Only when this kind of critique is broadened to include the mainstream and
penetrate the consciousness of the average Israeli, will the so-called peace process begin
to assume real, peaceful dimensions. Only when the Palestinians decide to rediscover their
democratic secular state framework and begin to adapt it to the present realities, will
hopes for real peace be rekindled. Call it a binational solution, a federal system, a
cantonal system on the Swiss model, the common denominators are still equal rights, equal
citizenship, plurality, co-existence, and common humanity.</p>

...portrays Arab children as murderers</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><strong>Diana Antone Ra&#146;ad*</strong></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How do they do it?! I bet I know. I bet they just sit around, whenever
they are having a slow day, blindfold themselves, and throw darts at a map of those 22
countries, inhabited by more than 290 million people, otherwise know as the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I&#146;m talking about how Hollywood filmmakers and writers decide on who
will be their next prey of vicious stereotyping. This time, the dart landed on Yemen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Paramount&#146;s latest release, &#147;Rules of Engagement&#148;, has
stooped to lower levels of shameless, racist, ethnic defamation than anything ever before
in Hollywood history. And you can just forget about authenticity: The film reeks of
inaccuracies and oversights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As part of my ongoing Master&#146;s research of the portrayal of Arabs in
American films of the 1990s, I have had to sit through Arab-bashing in a formidable
line-up of 20 top-selling films, sporting some of Hollywood&#146;s hottest actors and
actresses. How they can so carelessly lend their names to such irresponsible, unethical
works is a tragedy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I have seen hordes of Arab characters remorselessly killed, struck down
like bowling pins, usually as part of a &#147;happy ending&#148;. I have watched Arabs
demonized and their lives devalued. But never, in all the films I have seen&#150;and I
thought I had seen it all&#150;I did not ever expect to witness such flagrant, despicable
stereotyping as Rules of Engagement so brazenly flaunts.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This film also capitalizes on two of Hollywood&#146;s most renowned stars:
Samuel Jackson as decorated Marine Terry Childers, and Tommy Lee Jones as military
attorney Hayes Hodges. Hodges owes his life to Childers, who saved him from inevitable
death in Viet Nam. Thirty years later, Hodges must return the favour by defending Childers
in a court martial.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason for the court martial is a rescue mission gone bad. The
American Embassy (in what is supposed to be the Yemeni capitol but looks more like a dirt
road ghost town) is under attack by a crowd of enraged civilians, including women,
children and elders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just &#147;why&#148; these people are so outrageously upset is unclear,
except that later in the film, the U.S. national security advisor, William Soka (Bruce
Greenwood from Double Jeopardy), blows it off as &#147;the usual bullshit about American
presence in the Gulf.&#148; Childers is on a mission to save the ambassador (Ben Kingsley,
in a very lame role) and evacuate the embassy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What starts off with stone-throwing ends up with machine-gun frenzy. After
three of his men are down, Childers gives orders to open fire. His explicit and repeated
command to &#147;waste the mother f---ers&#148; results in a massacre, with 83 dead Yemeni
civilians and hundreds of severe casualties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fearing repercussions concerning relations with other Arab countries, the
nervous Soka decides to evade an international crisis by pinning the whole thing on
Childers. In the process, he destroys surveillance videotapes of demonstrators exchanging
fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In search of evidence that might help absolve Childers, Hodges flies to
Yemen, where loud music is playing in the streets and women are ululating.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Never mind that Arabs in reality observe at least 40 days of mourning for
the death of a loved one, let alone the death of 83 loved ones!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Friedken, the film&#146;s director, goes way out of line in his demonic
portrayal of Yemeni children. Initially, Hodges is near tears at the site of bleeding and
moaning youngsters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The hospital they are in looks more like a horse stable. (If this is
Friedken&#146;s idea of the Yemeni capital, Sana&#146;a, I&#146;d hate to see how he would
depict a remote village!).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After tickling our emotions and arousing our sympathy for these
&#147;innocent&#148; children, Friedken pulls the cheapest shot. A Yemeni boy aims at
Hodges with his finger, as if it were a gun. Then, our eyes are bombarded with flashbacks
of the demonstration where, apparently, the children&#150;not even teenagers, I&#146;m
talking about three-foot-tall CHILDREN!!&#150;were among the shooters, even the little
girl with the amputated leg. And to think we felt sorry for her!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What suckers we all are! Here we are accusing poor, innocent, gentle,
weeping Childers&#150;yes, this is your chance to see the macho Samuel Jackson in
tears&#150;when all along it&#146;s the Yemeni children who are the violent murderers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The film proceeds on its path of dubious destruction by maligning Islam
and taking poetic license&#150;more like a license to kill&#150;in interpreting the
concept of Islamic Jihad (the Muslim Holy War). In the courtroom, Hodges asks a Yemeni
physician to translate the Arabic voice message on a tape he found. Friedken would have us
believe that &#147;God commands [every Muslim] to kill Americans and plunder their
land.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am not a Muslim, but I know enough about Islam, even Jihad, to know that
what &#147;God commands&#148;, as Hodges blasphemously puts it, has nothing to do with
killing civilians or targeting Americans. As far as I know, when the Koran (the Muslim
Holy Book) came into existence over 1,400 years ago, there weren&#146;t even any Americans
(in the present context).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The film concludes with Jackson exiting as the exonerated hero further
endorses and legitimizes the killing of Arabs. And to top it all off, Friedken attempts to
eliminate any possibility for disbelief of this far-fetched movie by splashing a caption
before the closing credits about the fate of those who tried Childers, as if this were a
docu-drama.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And for all these negative Arab images, there was not ONE positive
representation. Someone tell me, please, by which earthly law is it acceptable for Arabs
to remain Hollywood&#146;s final scapegoat&#150;the constant target of its racist,
xenophobic contempt&#150;in an age when political correctness makes it practically
unthinkable to direct racial slurs against others, including Blacks, Latinos, Jews and
Asians? Racism is racism, and no one, NO ONE, should have to take it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the year turned 2000, I hoped we were at the dawn of a new age, an age
of self-reflection and public apologies for past mistakes, for past wars, past injustices.
An age of reconciliation, an age of new beginnings, learning from the mistakes of the
past.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are told &#147;the world shall never forget&#148; what Nazis, with the
help of propaganda, did to the Jews and others in Europe. We are reminded of the Japanese
concentration camps in America. We witnessed legendary Western filmmaker John Ford
publicly repent for his dehumanizing portrayals of Native Americans, for the hardship and
suffering to which his films contributed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But what good is all that when the first film with significant Arab
portrayal in the first year of the new decade and the new Millennium repeats the grave
sins of the past, plunging further into the abyss of immorality?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The scary thing is that this slanderous film, which opened in theatres
nation-wide the first week of April, has been number one in box office sales for the past
two weekends, earning $15 million in the first week and about $11 million in the second.
That means anywhere between 3.7 to 6.5 million people have seen it so far (depending on
theatre rates). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The excuse that this is entertainment and therefore has no social
responsibility, like other mass media, doesn&#146;t fly. The most dangerous propaganda can
seep through to our un-alerted subconscious as we relax to watch a film. I am sure, at
least for some of those who have seen Rules of Engagement, the next time they see a news
story about Arabs, about the Iraqi sanctions killing thousands of children, or the
Palestinian home demolitions, or the air raids on Lebanese cities, they will think to them
selves, &#147;waste the mother f---ers!&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How the people who took part in this film, whether behind the scenes or on
screen, can live with themselves after making such inhuman, damaging pictures is beyond
me. What Paramount is making from this film is BLOOD MONEY. As a member of ASU and
Phoenix&#146;s American-Arab Anti&#150;Discrimination Committee (ADC), I urge all of you,
dear readers, not to support this film, for the love of humanity!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bitter truth is that Rules of Engagement has been made&#150;despite
earlier, disregarded attempts of the ADC to converse with studio officials. It exists. It
will continue to exist, on video, DVD, and God help us, in a few years&#146; time, on
television in every American home. It will travel overseas, telling brutal lies to the
world about the people of Yemen, Arabs and Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All I can pray for is that people will denounce it and refuse to support
it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Military rules of engagement (in opening fire) forbid targeting innocent
women, children or the elderly, which is much more than I can say for this horrendous
film. It&#146;s one thing to portray adult men as killers. I can see how that would be
part of the &#147;rules of engagement&#148; for filmmaking in its desperate need for
villains and anti-heroes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But to turn the cameras on women and children, making hateful killers out
of them and condoning their murder...that breaks all filmmaking &#147;rules of
engagement&#148;, and foregoes all rules of human decency.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Israel&#146;s media and the right of return</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month&#146;s visit to Moscow by Eytan Bentsur, Director-General of
the Israeli Foreign Ministry, was described as a rare diplomatic undertaking. Its purpose
was to hand over two volumes, namely &#147;Documents on Israeli&#150;Soviet relations from
1941-1953&#148;, to the Russian Foreign Minister. Whilst acknowledging the critical
support given to the Zionist project by the Soviets, the 498 documents, soon to be
published, pours extra fuel on the burning issues of Palestinian expulsion and return. The
following is an assessment of the issue as it is currently played out in the Israeli
media.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To the same degree that its politicians have been obsessed with questions
of military security throughout the past 50 years, so too Israel&#146;s intellectuals were
always troubled by the existence of a Palestinian diaspora. The presence of millions of
refugees on its borders awaiting repatriation has, for all intents and purposes, been a
source of permanent discomfort and shame for the Jewish State. After the declassification
of government documents concerning the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, a number of Israeli
historians and sociologists began to publish in the late 1980s a series of works aimed at
putting across a &#147;New Historiography&#148; of the Arab-Israeli conflict and expulsion
of the Palestinians. But, like a festering sore that grows ever larger in the absence of
effective treatment, the twin issues of expulsion and repatriation have now spilled over
into Israel&#146;s mainstream media. Gideon Levy broached the subject in a feature article
published by <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i> on 26 March 2000. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under the caption, &#147;Ask forgiveness? Who, us?&#148;, Levy wrote;
&#147;We may have been the righteous victims in 1948, but on the road to realizing our
claim to justice, we perpetrated a terrible wrong on another people who had absolutely no
connection with our calamity. That wrong continues to bleed in the refugee camps, in the
occupied territories and in the Palestinian diaspora, and it will continue to haunt us and
prevent the achievement of a genuine settlement.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding his purported horror, Levy failed to develop his argument
to its logical conclusion. Quite like the new historians whose spirit he appeared to
invoke, the author seemed prepared only to weep for the people who were expelled or forced
to flee from their villages. He rightly admits they deserve recognition of the wrong done
to them and requests forgiveness. Yet, as is always the case, there was no explicit demand
for the Palestinian right to return. This, we may conclude, is still an area of taboo,
which even &#145;reformist and progressive&#146; Israelis are yet to transcend. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before the echoes of Levy&#146;s call were silenced, another writer, A.B.
Yehoshua, offered a strikingly candid and unapologetic rendition of the official line (<i>Ha&#146;aretz
</i>2 April 2000). In his piece entitled, &#147;Ending the Palestinians&#146; circle of
misery&#148;, he argues that &#147;there is no returning home for the displaced persons
and refugees of 1948, and there cannot be such a return. There can only be a return to the
homeland&#133;&#148; The beginning of their tragedy, Yehoshua suggests, must be traced to
the refugees who fled to Egypt, Syria, Lebanon and Jordan. They could have returned and
built new homes on their homeland. But instead of returning, they chose to lead a life of
humiliation and poverty; &#147;a welfare existence without rights.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the end, the Israeli novelist concluded the problem with the
Palestinians is that they confuse the concept of home and homeland. Their misunderstanding
must, therefore, be rectified in order to solve the refugee problem. They would be allowed
to return only to the Palestinian homeland whose borders must soon be defined and
recognized. As for the return to 1948 Palestine, his message is clear-cut. They can only
be brought back to their homes if they brought back to life the 6,000 Israeli dead who
were killed in 1948 when Israel was &#147;seeking peaceful coexistence.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><u><strong>From London to Oslo</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A critical reading of Yehoshua&#146;s narrative leaves a lingering
concern. Where does the history end, and where does the fiction begin? The newly
declassified documents on Israeli-Soviet relations offer the answer. Though by no means a
novelty, these documents belie every claim that the Zionists ever wanted &#147;peaceful
coexistence&#148;. They reveal that when Haim Weizmann met with Ivan Mikhailovich, the
Russian Ambassador to London in early 1941, his request was clear, &#147;Give me the land
occupied by a million Arabs and I will easily settle five times that number of Jews on
it.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having said that, one may naturally ask, if the Zionists really wanted
&#145;coexistence&#146; that badly, why did they reject it in 1939? Or, more specifically,
why did they refuse the proposals of the London Conference later embodied in the MacDonald
White Paper of May 1939? After all, His Majesty&#146;s Government had then declared its
intention to establish an independent Palestinian State where Arabs and Jews would share
government in such a way to secure their essential interests. As it appears, the Zionists
rejected the Policy Statement because it stated &#147;unequivocally&#148; that it was not
part of British policy that Palestine should become a Jewish State. Furthermore, this was
not attainable democratically because in 1939 the Jews constituted only 30% of
Palestine&#146;s population. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, the claim of &#147;seeking peaceful coexistence&#148; in 1947 had
only come about after the Zionists had obtained guarantees from Moscow and, more
importantly, Washington. Under the circumstances, it was the Americans who pressured the
British government to shelve the White Paper and declare Palestine a Jewish
State&#150;after Whitehall had previously announced that it would implement its plans,
regardless of the opposition. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was neither the first nor the last time that Palestinian/Arab
national aspirations were sacrificed in order to safeguard Zionists interests. Their
proclamation of independence from Ottoman rule in 1916 failed to secure British
recognition as promised. Quite unexpectedly, it was met with the Balfour Declaration that
altered the course of Palestinian history and changed the political and demographic
landscape of the entire region. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If the Zionist leadership had gained notoriety for its misrepresentation
of history, similarly the Arab political elite has become renowned for its unwillingness
to learn from the past. Acting on a promise of independence for Palestine in 1939, they
called off the revolt that was started three years earlier and had imposed <i>de facto</i>
control over most of Palestine. It was this rising power of Palestinian nationalism that
prompted the Zionists to turn to Moscow and Washington for help in order to speed up the
process. When Britain became fully on board in the mid-1940s, the stage was finally set
for the United Nations to rubber stamp the birth of the Jewish State.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the abortion of the 1936-1939 <i>Intifadah</i> led to the loss of 80%
of Palestine in 1947-1948, likewise the suspension of the 1987-1993 <i>Intifadah</i> has
left Israel with more than 60% of the occupied West Bank and Gaza Strip. There are, of
course, two significant differences. The United Nations &#147;authorized&#148; the
establishment of the Jewish State in 1948 (as Mr. Yehoshua carefully points out in his
article), yet no such endorsement was obtained for the accords that were concluded since
1993. And, if the issues of Statehood and occupation were the predominant issues of
1947-1948, the question of repatriation has today emerged to impose itself on the agenda
of politicians and media personnel alike.</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Writings on the wall</strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a rule, diplomats often begin their negotiations with maximal demands,
however outrageous and callous they may seem. When the horse-trading is over, they
invariably settle for lesser gains. Israeli opposition to Palestinian return is a good
example. Behind the façade of hard bargaining, they know perfectly well that in the end
they would have to recognize the Palestinian right of return. The truth about the refugees
is no longer an issue that can be misrepresented or hidden from public scrutiny and
accountability. Hence the conscience of humanity refuses to accept that victims should
oppress others to get their rights, especially when the latter had nothing to do with
their suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No other person was better placed to remind Zionist Israel of the
impending deluge than Nelson Mandela. Speaking to the Jewish Board of Deputies in London
in early April, Robin Island&#146;s most famous prisoner and South Africa&#146;s former
president told his audience that power and force will not be enough to secure peace in the
Middle East. Where is Caesar, Alexander and Hitler?, he asked his hosts. Any schoolboy
could have decoded this message. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though suppressed by guns and jackboots for the last century, Palestinian
stamina to regain their rights has never waned. Nowhere is this more pronounced today than
in the refugee camps. The evidence was brilliantly illustrated in the graffiti written on
the walls of Dheisheh camp during the Pope&#146;s visit. &#147;Sorry Pope!!!&#148;
&#147;We will not call any of the alleys of our camp after your name. These camps
can&#146;t last forever!!&#148; Those who argue that the West Bank &#147;homeland&#148; is
a substitute for stolen homes in historic Palestine must visit the camps and see for
themselves the writings on the wall.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our reading of the Israeli media notably afforded an insight into the
attitudes of the Israeli public on the question of Palestinian return. The results of a
survey conducted by Prof. Ephraim Yaar of Tel Aviv University, and published by the <i>Jerusalem
Post</i> (4 April 2000) underlined this. While 64% of Israeli Jews support the Law of
Return which enables Jews from any part of the world to immigrate to Israel and become a
citizen, 87% oppose the Palestinian right of return. This high number (87%), the professor
explained, &#147;shows that even among the secular and left-wing, there is a desire to
preserve the Jewish character of the State.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such are the values that determine Israeli policies and shape its social
structures. They are contrary to the spirit of our age and should be dismantled. This was
the theme of a speech recently given by Britain&#146;s Prime Minister, Tony Blair, to
newspaper editors in London. &#147;The breakup of the post-war international order and
globalization are calling into question systems constructed around the nation State.&#148;
Since it has &#147;become fashionable to predict the death of the nation State&#148;, as
Blair observed, we would surely be justified to expect the death of the ethnic State also.
To delay this inevitability, Israel continues to deny the Palestinian right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The case of Mazen al-Najjar</font></b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">MIAMI (Florida) - </b>Eleven-year-old Yara Al-Najjar has not hugged her
father for more than a year. She has seen him only through Plexiglas at a jail. So when he
entered the federal courtroom before a hearing last week, Yara went to see him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A federal agent stood and confronted her: &#147;Take your seat.&#148; She
did, putting her head in her hands and sobbing. Another officer, seated behind her, barked
again. &#147;Put your head up&#148;, he ordered.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She cannot understand why they were treating her so cruelly. &#147;Why do
they care if I cry?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her father, Mazen Al-Najjar, has been jailed for almost three years
without charges on secret government evidence that he is a dangerous associate of
terrorists. He made his first appearance in federal court last week to ask a judge to free
him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yara, her two sisters, her mother and about 30 members of their Tampa
mosque and the citizens&#146; group Hillsborough Organization for Progress and Equality,
or HOPE, travelled by bus from Tampa to show their support.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They were treated, they said, like suspects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the group of men, women and children walked onto the downtown
courthouse plaza with signs reading &#147;Free Mazen Now&#148;, a half-dozen U.S. Customs
officers ran from the building to confront them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When they complied with directions to move their protest across the
street, a man they believed to be an FBI agent stood six feet away and snapped
photographs, they said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When they passed through the metal detector at the entrance to the
courtroom, U.S. Marshals required photo IDs of all but the children and wrote down names
and birth dates. One woman said they noted her height.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They are trying to intimidate us,&#148; said Sami Al-Arian, a
University of South Florida professor and Al-Najjar&#146;s brother-in-law.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Najjar, a 42-year-old Palestinian refugee, has been ordered to be
deported for overstaying a student visa. His case is on appeal. He was denied bail by an
immigration judge who heard government testimony in secret and found Al-Najjar to be a
threat to national security.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week&#146;s hearing before U.S. District Judge Joan A. Lenard
requested his immediate release on constitutional grounds: His right to due process was
violated, his attorneys said. Lenard will issue her written decision after further review.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Najjar says he is not a terrorist. He was targeted by the U.S.
government, he says, because he worked at a USF-affiliated think-tank with Ramadan
Abdullah Shallah, who left Tampa in 1995 and a few months later became head of the
Palestinian Islamic Jihad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the day of his Miami court appearance, the government continued its
attempts to make Al-Najjar appear disreputable and dangerous, his attorneys said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Najjar was transported on a commercial flight from a Bradenton
detention facility after his attorneys made a formal request to the judge that he attend.
He was awakened at 1 a.m. for a hearing scheduled at 4 p.m., his family and attorneys
said. The flight takes an hour. He spent the day on a bench in a holding cell, said his
attorney, Joseph Hohenstein of Philadelphia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Najjar wore the same shirt and slacks he was wearing when he was
arrested three years ago. His wife, Fedaa Al-Najjar, said he told her that he asked to at
least wash the clothing, since it was wrinkled and smelled from being stored. Immigration
and Naturalization Service officers at the jail refused, she said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the few minutes he was given with his attorneys before his court
appearance, Al-Najjar was not permitted a conference room meeting but one separated from
them by a cloudy glass partition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The goal was not to have him present himself well to a federal
judge,&#148; Hohenstein said, &#147;and having a stressed-out, tired, ill-clothed
individual certainly contributes to that. Fortunately, a federal judge is not likely to be
swayed by such tactics.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Government officials said the measures are necessary for security.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Names of spectators have been taken at other hearings, said John Amat, a
deputy U.S. Marshal for the Southern District of Florida. The U.S. Marshal's Service is
responsible for security at the federal courthouse.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We&#146;re entitled to check people who come into the courtroom
whenever we feel the need to do it,&#148; Amat said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At a federal trial that convicted 11 gang members on drug and murder
charges in March, several spectators whose names were taken at the door were arrested on
outstanding warrants after they were run through the computer, Amat said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A defense lawyer at that trial said taking names is not typical at the
Miami courthouse.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>It bothers me because it is a public forum,&#148; said Albert
Levin. &#147;I think it&#146;s overreaching.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those entering the hearing last week passed through a metal detector,
emptied their pockets and submitted briefcases and handbags for searches. Amat said he
could not comment on whether the taking of names and birth dates was a decision made by
the U.S. Marshal&#146;s Service or done at the request of the FBI or the INS.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the Bradenton jail where Al-Najjar has been detained since his May 1997
arrest, supervisor David Wing said he was never asked about clothing for Al-Najjar. He
said he did not know why Al-Najjar was awakened three hours before departure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Najjar&#146;s family says it is because the government wanted him to
look like a terrorist in court. And it wanted his friends to feel intimidated.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>I felt it was humiliating for us. All the next day I kept
thinking, &#145;Why are you doing this to us?&#146;&#148; Mrs. Al-Najjar said. She said
she was told she could not bring her husband clothes. After the hearing, she and her
daughters rushed to see Al-Najjar before he was taken away.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Come, Safa,&#148; Mrs. Al-Najjar told her 4-year-old, whom
she held in her arms. &#147;We&#146;re going to see Baba.&#148; But the INS agents would
not let them get close.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>They don&#146;t have any mercy in their hearts,&#148; Mrs.
Al-Najjar said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Neither she nor her children have had a contact visit&#150;time with a
detainee in a visitor&#146;s room without a wall and window separating them&#150;since May
1999, she said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deplorable treatment of Al-Najjar is typical of the government&#146;s
attitude, said Andrew Kayton, a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union of Florida
working on Al-Najjar&#146;s case. Kayton, who lives and works in Miami, said he has never
seen the names of courtroom spectators written down.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Part of this is the culture of INS detention. The game is
de-personalization and debasement,&#148; said Kayton. &#147;This is a terrible thing. This
has caused inexcusable harm to his children.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The hearing&#146;s timing may have prompted some of the scrutiny. Last
week marked the anniversary of the bombing of the federal building in Oklahoma City.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No one balked at walking through a metal detector.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But taking names suggests everyone in attendance could be investigated. It
has a &#147;chilling effect on free speech and makes the Muslim and Arab community more
fearful,&#148; said Hohenstein.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is insulting, said members of the group, is the attitude that every
Arab is dangerous, every Muslim suspect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">HOPE member Richard Condon said he noticed that the schoolgirls wearing
traditional Muslim head scarves took longer to get through the security checks than did
he, a white adult male. One girl was told she could not bring in the folded American flag
she carried.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Pulling her to the side, Condon said, &#147;Give it to me.&#148; He passed
through the checkpoint without a second glance. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In order to proselytize and to spread their superstitions, Haredim often
exploit the distress of people. Relatives of terminally ill hospital patients, especially
if they are traditional, are often approached by messengers of a charismatic rabbi, who
first reiterate that the doctors cannot help and then suggest that the relatives buy some
sacred water, consecrated by a certain rabbi, and smear the patient with it. The
messengers relate stories about miracles that occur after the use of this sacred water,
which is never distributed without a non-returnable payment. The messengers, of course,
never mention the failure of sacred water miracles. The secular Hebrew press at times will
report on the failure of these miracles, especially when a large amount of money is known
to have been spent for the sacred water. Such reporting, however, most often only deepens
the chasm between those who read and those who do not read but loathe the secular Hebrew
press. In their own press the Haredim not only attack the secular press but also display
their general hostility towards secular Israeli Jews. Until the later part of the 1980s,
most of the Israeli Jewish public paid little attention to the Haredi press Since then,
general public attention has increased considerably. Dov Albaum, one of Israel's foremost
experts on Haredi affairs, focused upon this point in two Hebrew-language articles, one
published in the August 30, 1996 issue of the newspaper, <i>Yediot Ahronot, </i>the other
published in the July-August issue of the bi-monthly periodical, <i>Ha 'ain Hashvi'it (The
Seventh Eye), </i>which is published by the Israeli Democracy Institute and is devoted to
analyzing the Israeli press. Albaum discussed the structure of the Haredi press in <i>Yediot
Ahronot </i>and then proceeded to a discussion in <i>Ha'ain Hashvi'it </i>of the Haredi
attitude as a whole towards secular Israeli Jews. According to Albaum, the violent attacks
in the Haredi press upon Aharon Barak, the president of the Israeli Supreme Court,
attracted increased public attention. The Haredi press called Barak &quot;the most
dangerous enemy ever to face the Haredi public.&quot; Albaum pointed out that the earlier
Haredi press attacks upon the left wing kibbutzim, the Israeli army, the secular media and
many other secular institutions and figures aroused little general interest. The attack
upon the Supreme Court, long regarded as the holiest symbol of Israeli secular democracy,
piqued the interest of many secular Jews. The violent Haredi press attacks upon Yitzhak
Rabin, while he was prime minister, did not have the same effect. Shortly before Rabin's
assassination an article in one of the most popular Haredi weekly publications, <i>Ha
'Shavua (The Week) </i>predicted:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The day will come when the Jews will bring Rabin and Peres to the
  defendant's bench in court with the only two alternatives being the noose or the insane
  asylum. This insane and evil pair have either gone mad or are obvious traitors Rabin and
  Peres have guaranteed their place in the Jewish memory as evil Jews of the worst kind.
  They resemble the apostates or the Jews who served the Nazis.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Reiterating that secular Jewish interest in Israel heightened after the
attack upon Barak and the Supreme Court, Albaum observed that increasing numbers of
secular Israelis are insulted when they read in the Haredi press that their lives are
garbage and their children are hallucinating, lifeless drug addicts. Albaum explained:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Haredi journalists deliberately exaggerate all marginal phenomena in
  secular society. They describe all murders, cases of alcoholism and hard drug situations
  as characteristics of secular Jewish society. In addition, they allege as facts incorrect
  statements, engage in the wildest forms of slander and often use the most derogatory
  terminology. Their aim is to condemn absolutely the secular, Jewish lifestyle.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is difficult to avoid considering such depiction as analogous to the
Nazi methodology.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The structure of the Haredi press is significant. Albaum pinpointed as the
main Haredi ideological trendsetter <i>Yated Ne'eman (Faithful Tent-Peg), </i>the official
newspaper of the Degel Ha&#146;Torah faction, headed and controlled by Rabbi Shach. Albaum
explained that <i>Yated Ne'eman </i>is strictly monitored by a committee of five rabbis,
all appointed by Rabbi Shach and headed by Rabbi Natan Zohavsky. At least one of the
committee's rabbis is in the newspaper's office each evening except the Shabbat. Every
word of every article, advertisement and announcement must be approved for publication by
the rabbi(s) on duty. Certain words and expressions, such as aids or television, are not
allowed to be printed. The term &quot;Red Cross,&quot; supposedly associated with
Christianity, is especially prohibited from usage.</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yated Ne'eman </i>articles often ferociously attack rival Haredi factions.
One example is that all advertisements about social events of the Shas Party, which is
despised by Rabbi Shach, are not allowed to be printed. The importance of this prohibition
was highlighted when, after an apparent lull in the spiritual war between Rabbi Shach and
Shas, one of the newspaper's editors dared to publish an advertisement announcing the
bar-mitzvah of Aryeh Der'i's son. (Aryeh Der'i is a Member of the Knesset and an important
Shas leader.) Upon learning of this, Rabbi Shach strongly reprimanded Rabbi Zochovsky, the
head of the overseeing committee of rabbis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Spiritual censorship committees exist and monitor everything printed in
other Haredi newspapers. Albaum asserted: &quot;Freedom of the press is an unknown concept
in the Haredi press.&quot; Haredi editors, according to Albaum, proclaim a different kind
of freedom: &quot;the right of our public not to know certain things.&#148; The censoring
rabbis decide what the public should not know.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In reflecting the general Haredi attitude towards secular Jews, Haredi
press articles often present arguments reminiscent of anti-Semitic statements about all
Jews. Albaum pointed to a February 1996 article,<sub> </sub>for example, in which Israel
Friedman reiterated the position that the land of Israel belongs only to the Haredim and
that secular Jews and Palestinians should leave it. In addressing secular Jews, Friedman
in his article stated: &quot;Go away from here&#133;We tell you this in a friendly manner.
Go away. American crime will easily absorb the criminal secular youth who are all
enchanted by alcohol, drugs and earrings. They are bloodsuckers who drink our blood. They
dare to live on land that belongs to us.&quot; In another article Albaum quoted Nathan
Ze'ev Grossman, the editor of <i>Yated Ne'eman, </i>as attributing the rise of neo-Nazism
in European countries &quot;to the influence of the Rabin government.&quot; Grossman
described all kibbutzim as Nazi institutions and proposed &quot;to put them on trial
according to the precedent of the Nuremberg trials.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredim demand that other Jews should, at least in public and
especially in regard to matters of symbolism, behave according to their dictates. Haredi
demands, often supported by traditionalist Jews, so frequently cause political scandals
that they can be described as a staple of Israeli politics. More Israeli government crises
have occurred because of religious scandals than for any other reasons. To further their
political interests, the Haredim insist upon employing certain symbols. This insistence
has played an important role in Israeli politics. Many Israeli Jews, together with a much
greater number of diaspora Jews, in deference to what they believe is Jewish tradition and
the commandments of Judaism, support Haredi demands to keep and display symbols of
religious observance. Such support has produced scandal. One particularly illustrative
scandal occurred in Autumn 1992 and occupied Israeli politics for many months. During the
time of this scandal, the Haredi Shas Party threatened to leave the Rabin government, not
because of Rabin's plans to deal with the Palestinians nor because of possible concessions
to the Syrians but rather because the then Minister of Education Shulamit Aloni, on a
visit to Nazareth was photographed eating in a non-kosher, Arab restaurant and thus
violating the religious symbol of the ritual purity of food. Only six months prior to the
Aloni affair another scandal involving a Member of the Knesset had occurred; MK Yael Rayan
was photographed on a Tel Aviv beach, dressed in a swimsuit and reading a book on Yom
Kippur. All the religious political panics then protested furiously against what they
termed this &quot;profanation of Judaism.&quot; After hearing traditionally religious
Labor Party Knesset members echo the same sentiments, Prime Minister Rabin, who was not
traditionally religious, reinforced the accusation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During her tenure as minister of education, Shulamit Aloni made numerous
statements that were viewed as being in opposition to symbols in Judaism and thus
blasphemous; these statements resulted in scandals. One month before arousing scandal by
eating in an Arab restaurant, for example, Aloni publicly acknowledged that the denial of
the world's being created in six days was a tenable hypothesis. She also publicly struck
the controversial, although hardly earth-shattering, position that the teaching of Judaism
in the state's secular schools should be slightly changed. (She was content to leave as it
is the teaching of Judaism in the state's religious schools.) Aloni caused even more
furore when she publicly slighted some biblical figures. Ranny Talmor, a respected Israeli
journalist, rightly observed in her October 14, 1992 article in the newspaper, <i>Hadashot;</p>

<blockquote>
  </i><p ALIGN="LEFT">[Aloni] scarcely escaped Galileo's fate after he persisted in
  maintaining that the earth moved around the sun. Some supposedly enlightened, secular Jews
  whispered to one another:</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Of course she is right, but why does she need to say this in
  public?&quot; The Jewish Grand Inquisitors were delighted in their realization tat they
  had scored another victory against the weak-minded infidels.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jewish Inquisitors harassed Aloni even more after Rabin forced her to
apologize publicly in an open letter to Rabbi Ovadia Yoseph, the spiritual head of the
Shas Party. Yoel Markus, a well-known Israeli journalist, reflected widely held opinion
when he observed in his October 13, 1992 <i>Haaretz </i>article:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">As is well known, each concession in such matters only encourages the
  demand for more. This is why the abject surrender to Jewish religious demands by members
  of the Labor and Meretz Parties makes us wonder. Rabin has solemnly undertaken to check
  closely an intelligence report, submitted to him by the National Religious Party [NRP],
  describing how Aloni violated the Sabbath and ate non-kosher food in Israel and abroad.
  The Chairman of the Labor Party faction in the Knesset [Elie Dayan] publicly rebuked Aloni
  and Member of the Knesset Yael Dayan.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The NRP hired detectives to spy on ministers in order to discover what
transgressions of Jewish religious commandments they committed. Such spying continued
while the Rabin and Peres governments were in power. Rabin and Peres, while prime
ministers, obtained all the findings of the detectives and continually attempted to keep
their ministers from transgressing any religious laws in public.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his <i>Haaretz </i>article, Yoel Markus articulated many fears, shared
by a sizeable segment of the Israeli Jewish public:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">We can also expect demands that each minister and member of the Knesset be
  accompanied by a kashrut inspector, who holds a full-time job for this purpose and that
  similar inspectors be appointed to insure that kashrut is observed in every neighborhood
  and on every street in Israel. A demand may also be made to establish vice squads,
  authorized to raid private homes in order to ascertain whether kashrut is being observed
  and whether, God forbid, a wife does not by chance have sex with her husband in the period
  of impurity during and after the time of menstruation [lasting eight to fourteen days.]</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Other Israeli journalists expressed similar fears and went further than
did Markus in their published articles. Some attacked not only the religious but also the
secular Jews who remained silent about the attacks upon them and their behavior and who
would allow continual efforts by religious surveyors to brainwash systematically. Many
Israeli Jews, whose opinions were represented by certain journalists, saw the activities
and actual victories by religious factions as advancements towards a full-scale Jewish
&quot;Khomeinism&quot; in Israel.&nbsp;</p>
