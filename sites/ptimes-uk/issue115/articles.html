<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Public pressure forces PA to take tougher<br>
stance on Clinton&#146;s proposals</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem &#150; From Khalid Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Public pressure has apparently convinced the Palestinian Authority to
adopt an ostensibly tougher stance on the so-called Clinton proposals.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The proposals, presented by the U.S. President to Palestinian and Zionist
negotiators during mid-December, effectively ignore the right of return for the estimated
four and a half million Palestinian refugees and allows Israel to maintain sovereignty
over significant parts of East Jerusalem in violation of United Nations resolutions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On Saturday, 30 December, the PA issued a statement following its weekly
cabinet session in Gaza reiterating the traditional Palestinian position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement stated that a just and durable peace in Palestine would have
to be based on UN resolutions 242 and 338 and to include the implementation of UN
resolution 194, which grants the refugees both repatriation to their homeland and
restitution and compensation for their dispossession, homelessness and suffering.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement reiterated the paramount importance of the right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The leadership makes it abundantly clear that there can be no
durable peace in the region without the implementation of the right of return in
accordance with UN resolution 194.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement also pointed out that the maps suggested in the American
proposals were virtually the same maps that had been presented by the Israeli Prime
Minister Ehud Barak during the Camp David talks near Washington six months ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the issue of the Haram al-Sharif, PA spokesman Nabil Abu Rudeina said
the Palestinian leadership would not sign any agreement denying the PA full sovereignty
over East Jerusalem and the Haram al-Sharif compound.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abu Rudeina&#146;s statements were apparently in response to earlier
remarks by Barak, which some observers viewed as a retreat from the reported Israeli
willingness to accept Palestinian sovereignty over the Haram al-Sharif compound in return
for the Palestinians giving up on the right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barak said during a televised interview with Channel II of the Israeli
television Friday night, 29 December, that under no circumstances would the Zionist regime
sign an agreement ceding to the Palestinians sovereignty over the Haram al-Sharif.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, Barak stressed that any final status agreement with the PA
would have to contain two central components: First, a clear and unmistakable declaration
that the conflict between Israel and the Palestinians was over; and, second, the negation
of the right of return.</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA posture hardened</b></i></u><br>
The relative hardening of the PA posture is due mainly to the strong opposition among
Palestinians to the Clinton proposals, particularly for ignoring the right of refugees to
return to their former towns and villages.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sources close to the PA leadership in Gaza intimated that a torrent of
letters, faxes and email messages were flooding Yasser Arafat&#146;s offices in Gaza and
Ramallah, warning him that the refugees would in no way be bound by any agreement ignoring
the right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sources said refugee leaders in Jordan, Lebanon and Syria, as well as
local refugees in Gaza and the West Bank, who number around 500,000, made clear to Arafat
that they would turn against him and his leadership in case he &#147;crossed the ultimate
red line,&#148; an allusion to the refugees&#146; right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) urged the PA to reject
the American initiative which the Movement said would only end the conflict without ending
the Zionist occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jamal Mansour, an Islamist spokesman in the Nablus area, disclosed that
the Movement has done a meticulous study of the Clinton proposals and found that they do
not meet the very minimum of Palestinian rights and aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have found that the proposals violate the simplest of our
legitimate rights. The proposals would keep the bulk of Jewish settlements intact, would
effectively leave our holy places under the Zionists&#146; partial or complete occupation,
and, above all, they negate the sacred right of the Palestinian refugees to return to
their homeland,&#148; said Mansour during a rally marking the fourteenth anniversary of
the founding of Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Mansour argued that the fall of over 250 Palestinian martyrs and the
injury of 12,000 other Palestinian youths was not aimed at enhancing the negotiation
position of the PA but rather aimed at achieving good riddance from Zionist colonialism
and domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similar statements have been made by high-ranking Islamist officials,
including Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, politburo chief Khalid
Misha&#146;al, and Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi, who has been released from PA custody after
three years of intermittent administrative incarceration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the same rally in Nablus, Hizbullah leader Sheikh Hasan Nasrullah
spoke via an amplified telephone from Beirut, calling on all Islamic and liberation
movements in the Arab world to make the liberation of Palestine their top priority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We believe the main criteria for true Islamic commitment is how much
effort we put into resisting the Zionist scheme which targets our land and
sanctuaries.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, a coalition of Islamic and nationalist forces issued a
statement on Friday, 29 December, reiterating its &#147;absolute rejection of the American
proposals.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement pointed out that the proposals failed to meet the very
minimum of the inalienable Palestinian rights and would lead to the liquidation of the
right of return for the Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement also urged the PA to resist international and regional
pressures aimed at forcing the Palestinian Authority to accept the liquidation of the
Palestinian cause under the rubric of a lopsided peace process that is devoid of justice
and balance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The virtual Palestinian rejection of the American proposals is expected to
lead to a further escalation of Israeli repression of Palestinian resistance in the West
Bank and the Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Fateh Chief in the West Bank, Marwan al-Barghouthi, pointed out on 30
December that the next few days would witness an escalation of Palestinian protests
following a relative calm coinciding with the Eid al-Fitr holiday.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">One more little harassment: the checkpoints</font></b></h3>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="center">Samah Jabr*</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The barriers are cement, not just small lean-tos for guards. Ten years
ago, Palestinians left their houses and farms to discover a new Israeli surprise: the
checkpoint. The Israeli military phenomenon sitting squarely in the centre of our roads
told us all that these roadblocks were not temporary. They ominously signalled more
oppression to come. The move was an enhancement of Israel's plan to separate us into
village archipelagos and cantons. Apartheid had begun in earnest. Palestinian villages and
towns, not to mention closure of the city of Jerusalem, lay before us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since just the sight of the cement barriers stopped us short on our way to
work, hospitals, schools and neighbourhood visits, we could not slough off this latest
Israeli affront: another &quot;security measure.&quot; We knew it was yet another
imposition we'd have to live with. It did not make for happy relations with the brothers
and sisters who had decided to move into our backyards and our front yards as well. At
least the move gave us something new to talk about and talk we did. Taking action against
the checkpoint move, however, was another matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The guards manning the checkpoints were fully armed. Perhaps they would
not shoot, but the butt of a gun can be painful, too. Furthermore, the checkpoints had
accessories: special offices to issue permits. Anyone living outside the city of Jerusalem
would now have to get an entry pass to enter the Holy City.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just imagine driving from your home in Alexandria, Virginia, to your
office in the Department of the Interior in Washington, DC, and having to stop at least
four times to be checked before you crossed the Potomac and, finally, having to get out
and argue for a pass to the city in order to simply go to work.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I live with my family in Dahyat al-Barid, just across the Israeli
checkpoint on the Ramallah-Jerusalem road. To Americans, this road would appear to be a
street, a street full of potholes, to say the least. My home is within walking distance of
the checkpoint and the city of Jerusalem. For the last ten years, every member of my
family, including myself, wanting to go about our daily business in the city just down the
street have had to pass through this checkpoint. Even our closest grocery store is across
the demarcation line, so a simple trip to pick up milk becomes a hassle sometimes
involving long waits because the Israeli soldiers at the checkpoints have decided to pull
a suspect aside without the courtesy of letting the rest of us pass.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember being in America for the first time and going on vacation with
my host family. We were on the Indiana toll road and I saw a huge barrier rising ahead,
slow down signs and bumps on the road to make sure we did. I felt a tightness as we
approached the booths, and I almost asked, &quot;Was this checkpoint put up for me?&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My hosts were puzzled by my tenseness. To them, this barrier was a benefit
not a threat. I wish they could know what the sight of it meant to me. On the other hand,
maybe it was better that they didn't know what life is like in a part of the world their
country's government made possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My friend, Betsy, tried to tell me that the checkpoints are just like U.S.
toll booths. Not exactly. The checkpoints are not there to raise money to improve our
roads. Unlike toll booth operators who wish travellers a pleasant day, checkpoint guards
are there to harass us. Then, there's the ID card issue. Should, by chance, one of us
leave home without our Jerusalem ID (those born in Jerusalem have an identity card to
prove themselves or they can be sent away from the beloved city, but that is another
issue), that person is in for more harassment than usual and a return trip to the house to
get the card is the least penalty. No, being Palestinian and living in a canton created by
those who would possess our land is not like driving from New York to California without a
question asked along the way. You know the American Express advertisement, &quot;You can't
leave home without it?&quot; Well, you get the point.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My mother is the driver in our family. She works at a school in Shufat
which is just a 15-minute ride from our home. That is, it was a 15-minute ride ten years
ago. Now, with the checkpoints in place, it takes her as long as an hour during rush hour.
Often, Mom is chauffeuring me and, as I sit there, I make good use of my time. Sometimes,
I jump out and run over to a little shop to buy a newspaper and coffee. I see school kids
doing their homework in the back seat and women fixing makeup or men actually shaving
their beards. I'm proud of the coping mechanisms of my people. Stop us short and we'll
come up with useful ways to make the time count. I feel sorry for the frustrated drivers
who honk their horns and yell slurs, often with the risk of being pulled out of their cars
and held for long periods.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Once a friend of mine was attending the funeral of his sister-in-law in
Bethlehem. A well-known Palestinian attorney, he crossed through the last checkpoint on
his drive from Jerusalem to Bethlehem but was told to leave his car at the checkpoint for
special inspection. He left his car and walked into town only to return to find that
checkpoint soldiers had burned his car to ashes. &quot;Security,&quot; they told him.
Another time, I was walking through a checkpoint and a soldier was kicking a pregnant
woman in the stomach for some undefined offence. I stopped to help and ended up in
detention for the rest of the day. It amuses me to hear friends tell of how they avoid the
checkpoints by going through people's backyards and up and around the hills of the Holy
Land on days when the guards are on the alert, looking for another &quot;evil&quot;
Palestinian.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;We have our ways of getting where we want to go,&quot; is a common
jest among us. But, in truth, this isn't very funny. It isn't funny that we are forced to
have &quot;ways.&quot; Having to have our ways is not a path to peace, is it? Road rage
takes on new meaning in the Holy Land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sometimes, when I'm in a hurry, I leave my mom's car and take one of our
service vans that run all over the West Bank. The &quot;courageous&quot; service drivers
have developed some skills that helps them know how to &quot;handle&quot; the checkpoints.
They know all the tricks and the back ways into town. Remember when the Israelis-dressed
like Arabs-snuck into Ramallah and ended up getting killed by an angry crowd? The
international press suggested that these poor Israeli soldiers were lost. Lost? Given that
there is only one street from Jerusalem to the suburb Ramallah and anyone who lives in the
area, Israeli or Palestinian, has to get through the checkpoint or around it, and there is
no way to do that without knowing exactly where you are going, how could these men have
been lost? Could it be that they were not as clever as their country supposes them to be?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For me, the greatest problem of living in a world of checkpoints is
fatigue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Daily anxiety provoked by wondering every few miles whether or not there
will be &quot;an incident&quot; is an exercise in the infliction of Israeli-imposed
stress. I feel that for us, everyday Palestinians, the checkpoints are designed to make
life so unbearable that we'll just go away and let Israel have our homes and land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If you spend ten years of your life going through checkpoints, you cannot
avoid the days when you have to get out of the car, put your hands above your head and
wait. If you tire of this and decide to turn back, you can be shot in the back as you walk
away. While most of us do not get shot in the back, the harassment of the exercise takes
years off our lives-a form of intimidation that adds to the stress upon us by the Israelis
who feel that 'might makes right' and that torture like this will allow them to win. No,
there is not much win-win mentality among Israelis, at least not among those who have put
us on islands or reservations as the Americans call them.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How many women have delivered their babies at a checkpoint? How many
patients have died before they reached the nearest hospital? Checkpoints are a sign of
apartheid levelled at us by those who claim that having had evil done to them, evil by
them is permissible, all in the name of security, 'might makes right,' and the famous
words, 'never again.'</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That the others, we Palestinians, had nothing whatsoever to do with the
victimization of the Jews in Europe or with their self-imposed exile (which they now
expect us to adopt for ourselves) doesn't matter. Something, you see, has happened to the
Zionists and is exhibited through their denial of what we experience every day: the warped
Jewish interpretation of the &quot;Do unto others as you would have others do unto
you&quot; axiom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli/American war decreed against the indigenous people of
Palestine is as unwinnable as the war in Viet Nam was for the Americans. Might makes right
can never win over the will of oppressed people who love their homeland and their
lifestyles and who really have no choice but to stay in place. There are more Palestinian
refugees outside our borders today than any other group. Where is the place to put more?
Where is the famous intellect of the Jew? Have these people lost all their common sense?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Beyond that, however, is the biggest question of all. If the Israelis
murder every single one of us, we will die in body, but Jews will die in spirit. One
cannot perpetuate evil and not feel the effects and that is the bottom line to all of
this. Might makes right may overtake us, but morality and justice will have the last word.
That is my strength and the strength of the people I love in my small world. We may lose
the lives and lifestyles we love, but if we do, the moral strength and standing of Judaism
will be gone forever. That's what losing really means.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Palestinian Story:</font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">A Non-Fictional Tragedy With Few Readers</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ramzy Baroud*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Blaming the victim is nothing new to criminals who desperately try to
justify their crimes. Not a single occupying force throughout the world has failed to
point at its victims as the ones who deserve the blame for their acts of resistance. The
Libyan resistance of the Italian military occupation was described as &#147;barbaric&#148;
as was the Angolan resistance against the Portuguese. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A more recent example is the ongoing human tragedy in Iraq. For the last
ten years, Iraq has been held solely responsible by the United States government for the
death of its people. The United States, in fact, claims that its sanctions on Iraq are
aimed at weakening Iraqi President Saddam Hussein and destroying his regime&#146;s
&#147;weapons of mass destruction&#148; arsenal. Moreover, American officials have
repeatedly alleged that their country is actually striving to &#147;save the Iraqi
children.&#148; Such claims contradict many statistics, including United Nations figures,
that estimate the deaths of Iraqi children as a result of the U.S.-championed UN sanctions
at over one million. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the Israeli version of the &#147;blaming the victim&#148; strategy is
much more provoking and insulting to human intelligence than any other strategy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis blamed Arabs in 1948 for plotting to destroy it, thereby
justifying their obliterating 418 Arab villages, their driving a million indigenous
inhabitants from their land and their killing of thousands in the process. In 1982, the
Israelis blamed Lebanon for allowing &#147;terrorists&#148; to infiltrate Israel&#146;s
northern borders, which consequently justified their invasion of Lebanon, their total
destruction of the country&#146;s infrastructure, their killing of 20,000 Lebanese and
Palestinians, and their occupation of large parts of the country for decades as a
&#147;security zone&#148; for Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And now the Israelis are again blaming the victim. During the most recent
Palestinian uprising, which was clearly provoked by Israeli leader Ariel Sharon&#146;s
antagonizing visit to the Muslim holy sites in Jerusalem, the Israelis have managed to
blame Palestinians for the clashes during which thousands of Palestinians have been
injured, maimed and killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials and media propagated that Palestinian parents were
responsible for sending their children to die in clashes so that the Palestinians as a
whole could score cheap political points. The propaganda spread quickly and was uttered by
presumably respected figures. Even the Queen of Sweden expressed concern in a recent
speech regarding the deaths of Palestinian children, blaming their parents for exposing
their offspring to such harm, failing to mention the Israeli snipers who killed them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Horrifyingly, what should have been dismissed as a racist allegation was
quickly echoed throughout the Western media. On the American TV show &#147;60
Minutes&#148;, PA Chairman Yasser Arafat was asked by the host, Mike Wallace, what he
hopes to gain by the death of his young people, another devious attempt to blame
Palestinians for the death of their young rather than the Israeli occupation forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The relative success of the Israeli propaganda shows that much of the
Western world is still receptive to racism and shameful perceptions of non-Westerners, as
if they are lesser beings. In fact, an Israeli settler stated that there is a relationship
between Arabs and animals when he was interviewed on television in the early days of the
Intifada. He said, &#147;They [Palestinians] are not humans...they are animals.&#148;
Another lamented, &#147;In a way, those Palestinians aren&#146;t even animals. Animals
care for their offspring. Palestinians send their children out to kill or be killed.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arguing that Palestinian mothers in fact love and care for their children
is equally degrading, for it dares to recognize the Israeli argument, or at least some of
its false premises and racist conclusions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To avoid trying to prove that Palestinian parents are not sub-human, and
at the same time emphasize the racist Israeli claims, I find it most suitable to turn to
Charles Dickens&#146; <i>A Tale of Two Cities</i>, a reminder of a dark history that still
reveals itself through Israel&#146;s treatment of the Palestinians. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Tale of Two Cities</i>, although it narrates a dark segment of
Europe&#146;s history, was in many ways fictional. And if it was true, it is a folded
chapter in history. Yet, despite such facts, the horror portrayed in the novel somehow
manages to bring us to tears, to fill us with rage and make us sympathize with fictitious
characters who inhabited Paris hundreds of years ago. Thousands of Palestinian victims who
are blamed for fighting for their freedom have fallen, and more are falling every day. But
they are real, and their story is not a folded chapter in history. The Palestinian tragedy
is a &#147;tale of one nation,&#148; non-fictional and more tragic that any other, but
sadly a story that not so many care to read.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Abdul-Jawwad Saleh*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the end of the second millennium, three million Palestinians are
imprisoned in ghettoes by the very man whom the Palestinian leadership hailed as the
saviour of peace. Netanyahu had driven the peace ship off course. Barak scuttled it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the past 12 weeks, collective punishment, in every form, has been
imposed on the inhabitants of these ghettoes -- the Palestinian people. Five hundred
settlers in Hebron impose a curfew on 40,000 Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under a racist colonial policy of separation, the Israeli occupation
forces are digging deep trenches in bypass roads to prohibit the Palestinians from using
them to escape imprisonment. Over 200,000 labourers, the products of Israel's policy of
dependency, are unable to reach their places of work in Israel. Movement into and out of
these ghettoes is restricted. Muslims and Christians are prohibited from praying in their
holy shrines in Jerusalem. Women in labour, especially those travelling from villages, are
stopped at Israeli military posts and prevented from reaching the hospital. Wounded
children and young men are left to bleed to death. Ambulances are shot at, and their
drivers are killed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The colonisers, backed by the army, are impoverishing and starving the
population of the rural areas, preventing the population from harvesting their olive
crops. They have uprooted 23,465 fruit trees so far. Greenhouses have been destroyed by
bulldozers and homes have been razed, leaving whole families with no shelter under the
barren cold skies. Schools are closed, and classes are held in tents, without desks or
chairs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian ghettoes are besieged by two armies: the official military
forces of the occupation, and the army of the Zionist colonisers, mostly fanatical
ideologues who regard Baruch Goldstein -- who slaughtered tens of Palestinians praying at
dawn in Hebron -- as a hero and an example to be emulated. Many of these settlers have
been found guilty of killing Palestinian children and other innocent bystanders in cold
blood. They are the perpetrators of the assassination attempts on the mayors of Nablus,
Ramallah and Al-Bireh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These two armies are perpetrating the most horrendous collective crimes
imaginable against Palestinian cities, towns and villages, as well as the refugee camps
where the victims of Israeli attacks in 1948 live today. This is an apartheid regime. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The generals of the official Israeli army are united with the settler
army. The occupation forces have used extravagant violence, deploying gunships, snipers
and tanks to crush civilians who are struggling to defend their land and their very
existence. Assassination campaigns have been launched against Palestinian activists.
Palestinian journalists and photographers as well as foreigners have been wounded. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A former Shin Bet security service director criticised such policies
recently. Ha'aretz newspaper quoted him in its editorial of 6 December as saying:
&quot;This is the same security outlook whose failure to realise its aims led almost
naturally to the idea of separation from the Palestinians... Is the option of a Jewish
democracy with apartheid acceptable? In my opinion, no.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Under Barak's government, the state of Israel has become the state of the
Israeli army. Barak has outdone Shamir and Netanyahu in allocating budgets for building
new and expanding old colonies in the Palestinian occupied territories. The Israeli press
has also launched a propaganda campaign against the Palestinian people's uprising. One of
its most outrageous and perverse claims has been that Palestinian parents send their
children out to be killed by Israeli soldiers. Some American and Israeli writers have
described this as &quot;Palestinian paganism.&quot; This is more than racist folly -- it
is fascism. It is not even an attempt to dehumanise the Palestinians -- it is far worse,
for even animals protect their young. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If willingness to sacrifice their children makes the Palestinians
something less than animals, however, what are the civilised Israelis who are more than
eager to massacre those children? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian ghettoes will never surrender to Oslo and its conditions.
The Al-Aqsa Intifada, as a popular uprising, is a refusal of Clinton's attempt to dictate
the priorities of the political process in the interest of Israeli security. It is an
outcry against the creation and enlargement of Palestinian intelligence agencies at the
expense of democratisation and essential public services. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the establishment of the PA, conditions for the Palestinians have
worsened. Poverty has increased, according to World Bank and United Nations reports. If
the closures continue, poverty will reach the dangerous rate of 50 per cent. Corruption
has spread. <br>
Many factors triggered the Al-Aqsa Intifada, among them internal Palestinian problems, and
the leaking of a &quot;final solution&quot; that would have legitimised permanently the
Israeli occupation of the territories taken in 1967. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA does not yet know the people it governs. This time, it has
succeeded in channelling the Intifada against the occupation. But the Palestinian
leadership should think twice before returning to the negotiating table on the same terms.

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Israeli Elections: Which PM can kill more <br>
Palestinians during the peace process?</font></b></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Dr. Mohamed Khodr</em></b></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Now that America&#146;s election quagmire is over with President
Elect George W. Bush the winner, America can begin the process of healing, uniting,
reflecting on the strength of its democracy, and analyzing the uncharted waters of its
electoral process and its system of government. As an American citizen, I am proud and
indebted to our civil peaceful democracy and transition of government that we enjoy in the
comfort of our homes. It took time and wars for America to eventually settle on &#147;One
Man, One Vote&#148;, which has been the hallmark of its democracy. The One Man, symbolic
of all citizens, meant that each American had the right to vote regardless of religion,
race or gender. Bush vs. Gore fought for the right of every American voter to be counted
so that all Americans may LIVE in peace and harmony during the next four years.
Gore&#146;s mantra of &#147;I&#146;ll Fight For You&#148; had no militaristic or evil
connotations. No one was going to be harmed, jailed or killed because of Gore&#146;s
&#147;chad&#148; fight. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Tragically, the same cannot be said of the elections in the
so-called &#147;democracy&#148; of Israel. The last two months of the al-Aqsa Intifada in
the Palestinian occupied territories showed that the real &#147;democratic&#148;
discussions among Barak, the Likud and the settlers was not about Israeli&#146;s economy,
education, future or the second-class status of Israeli Arabs or even about the elusive
&#147;Peace Process&#148;, but rather the debate was more animalistic and
instinctive&#150;&#147;Is the Barak Government Killing Enough Palestinians?&#148; Barak,
the Commando General personally responsible for assassinating Palestinians in their homes,
was under a great deal of pressure from his own Labor party, the Likud, the settlers, the
Rabbis and even the so-called &#147;peaceniks&#148;, as well as the Israeli populace, all
of whom were united in suppressing the Palestinian intifada at all costs. It seems killing
an average of five Palestinians a day and injuring scores of them did not meet their quota
for spilling Palestinian blood. Alas, Barak, the man who offered the &#147;most generous
concessions&#148;, saw his support dwindle and the only way to reclaim his political
future was to show Israel that he&#146;s just as good a killer as any other Prime Minister
of Israel. Thus he unleashed the most modern U.S.-made helicopter gunships, the most
deadly tanks, snipers, rockets, gunboats and assassins to prove his worth to Israel&#146;s
&#147;peace-loving, democratic&#148; citizens. Now Barak was on par with the murderous war
criminal Sharon, a potential opponent in the upcoming election. However, Barak&#146;s
murderous campaign was insufficient to satisfy the draconian thirst of the Israeli public.
In fact, the Likud and the settlers adopted the motto, &#147;Let the IDF [Israeli Defense
Force] win.&#148; (Translation: Kill them, kill them all; they&#146;re just like animals,
snakes, who throw their children in the path of bullets; let&#146;s get rid of them once
and for all. This is our land, what are they doing here anyway?) They accused Barak of
&#147;RESTRAINING&#148; the IDF. It didn&#146;t matter to Israel that the world, excluding
the pandering Clinton and Albright, and every human rights organization, including
Israel&#146;s own Bet&#146;selem, condemned Israel for using &#147;excessive force&#148;
against unarmed civilians. It never mattered before, it won&#146;t matter now.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Shockingly, as Palestinians died daily, Barak kept talking of the
need for peace negotiations with the Palestinians despite declaring that the &#147;peace
process&#148; was dead because now he has NO PARTNER (Arafat). As usual, whenever there is
Palestinian blood being shed by Israel one can depend on Israel&#146;s and America&#146;s
spin and media machine to masterfully unleash the right words and images upon the
ill-informed and unsuspecting Americans, as well as the population of Europe, to ensure
blame be placed upon the Palestinians and to raise the red flag of Israel&#146;s imminent
demise. One of the worst examples of pandering hypocrisy is the American television
programme&#146;s &#147;60 Minutes&#148; segment on the death of Muhammad Al-Durra, the
12-year-old whose videotaped death shocked the world. Bob Simon, a Jewish American
reporter still harbouring anti-Arab sentiment from his days as a prisoner in Iraq during
the Persian Gulf War, went to Israel to allow the Israeli General in charge of the troops
who shot the Palestinian child to forge a recreation that raised enough doubts about who
shot him that without even completing the investigation, the IDF issued a report saying it
was possible that Palestinians killed the child. Mr. Simon never interviewed the
child&#146;s father, the cameraman who shot the famous footage or any witnesses. There was
no mention of the IDF killing in cold blood the first ambulance medic to rush to help the
child and his father or of the wounding of the second medic who attempted the same. Simple
enough, CBS spent money to help exonerate the IDF. The same General has now been relieved
of his command after conducting his libellous investigation, but CBS is not expected to
review the case or apologize. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Domestically, Barak was killing Palestinians to satisfy Israel&#146;s
inherent thirst for Palestinian blood while internationally he was the Statesman crying
helplessly for peace but alas finding no partner. The world and the American media obliged
Barak, the hero of Camp David II, by solely focusing on the Statesman while deliberately
ignoring the funeral processions and lamenting the loss of the peace processions.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Barak&#146;s bumbling, commando style of politics&#150;trusting
only his instincts&#150;drove him deeper into the political grave. How sad and tragic it
is to see the world abandon all peace initiatives and go into paralytic limbo until
Israel&#146;s Prime Minister decides to move on peace or until Israel&#146;s elections are
over or until Israel gives some green light to the international community. Meanwhile,
during this political vacuum, Palestinian children are enriching the soil with blood,
tissue, minerals and nitrogen for the benefit of the settler&#146;s landscaping.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Barak&#146;s politically motivated resignation was timed to
outmanoeuvre Netanyahu, a man Israel and the world rejected and labelled as anti-peace and
pro-death. Now the Knesset in its anger may be changing the law to allow Netanyahu to run
for office in lieu of the fat, walking-time-bomb Sharon. This time, American consultants
like the rabid bulldog James Carville won&#146;t be involved; he and Gore will be busy
sweeping Florida for lost chads to soothe their loss despite a booming economy; a nation
at peace; a popular President; and the support of the usually reliable and invincible
American Jewish community, labour unions and good-for-the-vote-only minorities, as well as
the powerful media and Hollywood.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>So what might Israel&#146;s democratic election campaign between
Barak and Netanyahu look and sound like (while away from the world&#146;s eyes the daily
death beat of Palestinian funerals continues)?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. <b>On Palestinians</b>: Barak and Netanyahu&#146;s campaigns will hoist
this banner:</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Vote for Me: I can kill more Palestinians per day than he
can&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>One Dead Palestinian Should EQUAL One Vote&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. Each will promise not only to build more settlements but offer more
State subsidies to the settlers (courtesy of the ignorant American taxpayer) and free
military tanks to each settlement. Water will be provided free to settlements from
Palestinian wells while sewage will continue to be dumped on Palestinian land. Any Peace
Agreement will be submitted to the settlers for approval. Palestinians will be allocated
40% of the West Bank and Gaza as their State with huge impenetrable fences built around
them. They will be denied entry into Israel proper (which includes the settlements). The
rest of the land will be annexed. Some smart-alec reporter will ask them both, &#147;But
won&#146;t the United Nations, United States and the world object to this and pass UN
resolutions?&#148; Both will look at the reporter with scorn and disgust. Netanyahu will
respond, &#147;I think history has shown what we think of UN resolutions. Not even our
&#145;strategic idiot&#146;, sorry, I mean &#145;ally&#146;, America will dare support
such resolutions. We kill Palestinians every day with their money and taxes; you
don&#146;t see any of them complaining. In fact, if you&#146;ve noticed, Clinton and
Albright only bemoan the loss of Israeli life; they could care less about Palestinians.
American politicians know to support Israel no matter what, if they know what&#146;s good
for them in their next election. So Israel doesn&#146;t care what the world thinks;
besides, the whole UN is anti-Semitic.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. <b>On Jerusalem</b>: Both will promise to demolish the Haram al-Sharif
once and for all and build the third Temple. Israel will tell the entire Islamic world:
KISS MY KOSHER---&#148;; Jerusalem is Jewish, not Christian, not Muslim. Anyone who
doesn&#146;t like it&#151;tough! We have America&#146;s Christian Evangelists to support
us. They think they&#146;re using us to kill or convert us to bring back the Messiah. What
fools! We&#146;re using them! They forget Jews don&#146;t believe in Jesus while Muslims
do.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All the while our courageous Arab and Islamic leaders will continue to
embarrass themselves, their faith and their people by holding more meetings, visiting each
other to imply movement, talk, talk, talk, while concurrently comforting America and
Israel that they&#146;re simply fooling their subservient stupid people but they&#146;re
not going to jeopardize their relationship with Israel no matter what, even if they have
to kill all the demonstrators. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Funny how Barak kills Palestinians, curses Arafat and dismisses him as a
peace partner, kills Israeli Arab citizens, supports Sharon&#146;s &#147;right&#148; to
desecrate Masjid al-Aqsa, yet now runs on a mandate for &#147;Peace&#148; and desperately
NEEDS Arafat to sign a peace agreement to shore up his electoral chances! He is now
promising Israel &#147;real&#148; peace&#150;conveniently neglecting the fact that for 17
months he squandered his peace mandate&#150;he has been responsible for the killing of
Palestinian children, he has built more settlements and confiscated and demolished more
Palestinian homes than Netanyahu and in a fit of Satanic logic blames the Palestinians for
their deaths while now seeking their support and the support of the Israeli Arabs (90% of
whom voted for him in the last election and who consistently supported him in the
Knesset&#146;s no-confidence votes). </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>But what can we Americans do? We&#146;ve been told Israel is our
&#147;ally&#148; against violent Islam, is the only &#147;democracy&#148; in the region,
has withstood five wars the Arabs started, is a small country in a sea of hate and
militancy, shares our values and Israelis look, dress and smell like us while the
Palestinians refused the 1948 partition that would have given them a State. We hear on our
media that they&#146;re always screaming that they&#146;ll kill Jews and Americans and
everything Western, therefore why should we mind that each of us has sent EACH Israeli
over $22,000 despite their wealth? We don&#146;t understand why Arabs don&#146;t get our
viewpoint? Besides, how come none of them go on television to tell us their side of the
story? It&#146;s obvious that they know their argument doesn&#146;t hold water and that an
Israeli will cream them with facts. Besides, we believe in the Judeo-Christian tradition
not like that foreign, violent Islam thing.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>So let Barak and Netanyahu begin their elections and let us wallow
in such well-packaged Zionist lies. In the meantime, as long as CNN and the other
television networks don&#146;t show us Palestinian blood, we&#146;ll enjoy our Christmas,
New Year, and of course the Super Bowl. Yeah, man, I think this year the St. Louis Rams
are going to kick some butt again. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">New year, old deadlock</font></h3>
<i>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Palestine: between illegal occupation and
legitimate resistance</font></i></b></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Dr. Daud Abdullah*</strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Armistice, yes. But peace, no.&#148; This is how the former United
Nations Mediator to Palestine, Dr. Ralph Bunche, summed up his work toward the end of his
distinguished career. The American-born diplomat had no doubt about where the blame lay
for the &#147;evasive peace&#148; in the region. &#147;The trouble is,&#148; he told a
Jordanian Ambassador to the United Nations, &#147;You Arabs do not know how to start, but
once you start, you know where to stop. The Israelis, on the other hand, know very well
when to start, but to their misfortune they do not know where to stop. This has been the
cause of their tragedy throughout history.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although Bunche&#146;s tête-à-tête with Ambassador Muhammad El-Farra
took place way back in June 1967, its core message appears as relevant today as it was
then. The principal actors may have changed, but Israel&#146;s policy toward the
Palestinian people has remained fundamentally the same. Sure enough, the names <i>Irgun
Zwei Leumi</i> and <i>Haganah</i> may no longer appear on the International Police list of
terrorist organizations, but their bloody legacy still influences Israeli domestic and
foreign policies. The old guard led by Begin, Shamir and Rabin may no longer occupy centre
stage, yet as far as their policies go it is business as usual. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Member States of the United Nations supported the creation of a
Jewish State in Palestine half a century ago, it was their hope that Israel would be a
peace-loving country and its people would have benefited from their tragic past. There was
not the slightest inkling that their handiwork would prove to be a source of permanent
injustice, terror and inhumanity. Yet, from Deir Yassin in 1948 through Sabra and Shatila
in 1982 to the al-Aqsa Mosque in 2000, the history of Zionist Israel has been a litany of
crime and wrongdoing. For this reason Britain&#146;s pre-eminent historian, Arnold
Toynbee, concluded that Israeli colonialism since the establishment of the State of Israel
is one of the &#147;blackest cases in the whole history of colonialism in the modern
age.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite being the prime target of this onslaught, the Palestinian people
have nevertheless survived every genocidal campaign. Their survival, which Toynbee
compared to that of the Vietnamese, will eventually restore for the Palestinians their
freedom and political independence. They will continue to resist Israeli occupation not
because they love to see their children die, their homes demolished, or their citrus
groves destroyed, but only because Israel has left them with no alternative. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The poor man&#146;s weapon</b></u><br>
Even in the face of this continuing aggression and imbalance of military power there still
remain favourable opportunities on other fronts. When trade union leaders, professionals
and religious leaders across the region raised the call for an economic boycott of Israeli
and American products after the outbreak of the Aqsa Intifada, they had set in motion a
machinery that was very similar to that which toppled the Apartheid regime in South
Africa. This initiative may prove to be the most effective weapon used in recent years to
advance the Palestinian cause. The ring of steel created by the various peace treaties and
accords may afford the Jewish State some breathing space from unwanted
&#145;infiltrators&#146;, but it would not be enough to cushion the impact of a
peoples&#146; boycott throughout the Islamic and Arab lands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One may rightly ask, what hope is there for the success of the current
campaign when the boycott started by the Arab League in 1945 did not prevent the
establishment of Israel, the occupation of Arab lands, or ensure the return of the
Palestinian refugees? Such a question begs another two: was the boycott ever fully
enforced in letter and spirit? And, are the regional governments doing enough to prevent
the repackaging and disguise of Israeli goods in third countries before they are smuggled
into their countries? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Notwithstanding, there are evidently some signs which further enhance the
chances of success of this boycott. To begin with, experience has taught the peoples of
the region that they cannot rely entirely upon their rulers and governments to champion
their causes. And, given the nature and history of the conflict with Israel, they feel
obliged to discharge their individual as well as collective responsibilities with or
without the blessing of their governments. Hence the reason local associations and
community leaders have assumed the coordination of the current boycott.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another new element in the equation is the boycott of American goods in
the Arab and Islamic lands. In the past, this economic weapon was largely confined to an
Arab boycott of Israeli produce. The Aqsa Intifada has added a new dimension. It has
raised the stakes by mobilizing 1.5 billion Muslims across the globe in the boycott of
Israeli goods as well as those of its chief ally, the United States. Without the political
and military backing of the United States, Israel could not have trampled roughshod upon
the Palestinians or defied the will of the international community for five decades. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the official level, the need has become ever more urgent for regional
governments to enable the Palestinians to break their chains of economic dependency on the
Jewish State. For as long as they continue to derive 80% of their imports from Israel, the
Palestinians would remain subject to the whims of Israeli political, financial and
military interests. Additionally, regional governments must bring to a halt the various
economic machineries like the Middle East and North Africa Economic Conference (MENA) and
the Euro-Mediterranean Partnership (EMP) through which Israel hopes to capture the Arab
market and dominate their economies. The other areas, such as banking, financial markets,
customs and excise, the combat of smuggling and border control, all remain well within
their powers to act decisively in their favour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the ground, the boycott is slowly but surely gathering momentum. In
Cairo it forced the food giant Sainsbury to close several of its branches with losses
running up to 75 million Egyptian pounds. American companies like McDonald&#146;s have
recorded staggering losses at the close of last year because of the dramatic slump in
sales. Be that as it may, regional commentators maintain that the boycott must not be seen
simply as an attempt to execute punitive measures against Israel. It is, besides, a
deliberate effort to promote Arab-Islamic self-reliance and protect the market shares for
local and regional produce. Surely the need for a reorientation of priorities and tastes
cannot be overstated when the food bill of $20 billion accounts for 62.6% of Arab imports.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course the moral imperative to boycott the Jewish State is not limited
to its inhuman treatment of the Palestinian people. It is also because of Israel&#146;s
systematic undermining of international law and natural tendency toward crime. This is a
State that the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) condemned and
blacklisted along with 14 others in June 2000 for allowing billions of illegally acquired
dollars to be laundered and recycled through their banks or invested in &#147;front&#148;
companies. When peoples of other States in the region are blockaded, starved and denied
medicine for not implementing UN resolutions, there can be no excuse for Arab governments
not to boycott Israel for its refusal to cooperate fully with international investigations
into crimes ranging from human rights abuses to the embezzlement of international aid and
failure to control the flow of money from drug trafficking. Although it is extremely
unlikely that they would gain support for this initiative in the Security Council, they
must be assured of the unswerving support of their peoples in this undertaking.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bad old days</b></u><br>
Having presided over the shortest and one of the bloodiest administrations in the history
of the Jewish State, Prime Minister Barak has finally returned to the point from where he
started. After only 19 months in office he has called a national election to harvest the
fruits of his political ineptitude and military high-handedness. This is the season of
military repression in the occupied Palestinian territories, social and economic turmoil
at home, and international isolation abroad. How very much today resembles yesterday: as
the 1996 tunnel opening had sealed the fate of the Netanyahu regime, so too the
desecration of al-Aqsa Mosque in 2000 hastened the demise of the Barak regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Soldiers are soldiers and statesmen are statesmen. Israeli soldiers are no
exception. Regardless of how long they don the attire of statesmen and speak the language
of diplomacy, they remain irreversibly committed to a military solution with the
Palestinians. This is why Ehud Barak would very much prefer a government of national unity
with a Likud party led by Ariel Sharon. Such a marriage, he believes, would facilitate a
return to the bad old days of the Qibya and Sabra and Shatila massacres. But the truth is
if Sharon was unable to impose a military solution on the Palestinian people when he was
at the height of his military career, there is no likelihood that he would succeed today,
especially after the humiliating defeat in South Lebanon. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After pandering to the bigotry and fancies of religious extremists, Barak
has completely squandered his creditability and trust with the Palestinian leadership. His
overtures today seem more a matter of wishful thinking than purposeful intent. Whatever
his fate, his threats and use of force would fail to produce a valid and permanent treaty
for as long as the illegal occupation of Palestinian land continues. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestine&#146;s changing fortunes between illegal occupation and lawful
resistance have been marred with legal and moral contradictions. When Nazi Germany
occupied France during the Second World War, the acquisition of territory by conquest was
rejected and opposed. Indeed, the rights of return and resistance were upheld under the
banner of international legitimacy. Today, different standards are applied to the
non-European victims of Zionist occupation. A lower premium has been placed on Palestinian
national rights. And, because 78% of the settlers are immigrants from Europe, Russia and
the United States, their rights were rendered paramount. Worse still, the rules of
international law were bent, and even broken, to satisfy Israel&#146;s need not to be seen
as an illegal settler State but rather to be recognized as a colonial power with the right
to decide the destiny of the Palestinian people. The natural consequence is a bloody
deadlock with neither peace nor armistice. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Hanan Ashrawi</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Violence in the Middle East has so far claimed the lives of over 325
people and wounded over 11,000&#151;most of them Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest incidents took place in the early pre-dawn hours as Palestinian
Defense Forces (PDF), in response to gunfire by Israeli gunmen, shelled the empty
buildings in which the gunmen were taking shelter. Five people were killed and 20 injured
in the ensuing exchange of fire. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian President Yasser Arafat once again called on the Israelis to
&#147;stop the violence.&#148; He once again pledged Palestine&#146;s unwavering
commitment to peace and called on the Israeli people to &#147;stop their acts of terrorism
against Palestinian civilians and PDF personnel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Deploying &#147;our Markaba tanks, our Apache and Cobra gun-ships, and the
closure of Israeli territories&#148; are all &#147;essential measures to protect the
security of Palestine,&#148; he added. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Praising the &#147;policy of restraint&#148; practiced by the PDF,
President Arafat said that if it took the &#147;killing of 2,000 more Israelis&#148; to
put an end to Jewish rioting and terror, he would do so. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In response to the deteriorating economic conditions within the Israeli
territories, Palestinian officials said that they would allow 10,000 Israeli workers to
work in Palestine as a &#147;gesture of goodwill.&#148; To qualify for permits, these
Israeli workers must be married, with several children, and over 35 years old. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This latest easing of the closure of the Israeli territories came in
response to the European Union envoy&#146;s appeals to Palestinian leaders not to allow
the economy of Israel to collapse as a result of the multiple closures. &#147;The entire
European economic aid package to Israel is being absorbed by these closures,&#148; the
envoy said. Europe has pledged an estimated US$ 500 million annually to help build up the
Israeli economy. The cost of the closure is estimated at US$ 10 million per day. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the beginning of the violence (or uprising, as some Israelis call
it), unemployment has risen to 40% in Israel and over 30% of the entire population of
Israel is now living below the poverty line. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Called upon to release the funds that Palestine has refrained from handing
over to the Israeli treasury as per the interim agreements (VAT and excise tax), the
Palestinian Minister of Finance said the Palestinian treasury was owed for hospital and
other expenses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At a press conference held by the Palestine army spokesperson, and in
response to questions concerning Palestine&#146;s use of &#147;excessive force&#148; in
quelling the riots, General Shati reiterated that the soldiers have &#147;strict
orders&#148; not to shoot &#147;unless their lives are threatened.&#148; PDF personnel are
facing &#147;life-threatening and dangerous conditions&#148; and are acting strictly in
&#147;self-defense.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for the large number of Israeli children being killed (30% of the total
killed), General Shati once again called on the Israeli leadership not to &#147;send
children into the line of fire&#148; for the sake of &#147;scoring media points.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;As you know,&#148; he stated, &#147;the Israelis do not share the
same values that we have, and they do not have the same feelings for their children.&#148;
It is part of the Jewish culture to &#147;glorify martyrdom,&#148; and cynically sending
their children out to die provides the Israeli leadership with a &#147;cheap propaganda
victory.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that most injuries were in the head and the upper part of the
body is owing to the &#147;skill of Palestinian snipers,&#148; Shati explained. These are
highly trained and skilled experts who know how to stop &#147;lethal attacks&#148; from
&#147;Jewish terrorists.&#148; If there are any &#147;excesses,&#148; the PDF will carry
out its own investigations. &#147;Rest assured, we will do everything possible to
investigate and to discipline those responsible.&#148; He concluded, &#147;You must
remember, this is a war situation. Our soldiers are responding to stones, Molotov
cocktails, and live fire from the Israeli rioters.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a meeting with the visiting UN High Commissioner for Human Rights,
representatives of Israeli human rights organizations and NGOs raised the issue of the
Palestinian settlements on Israeli land occupied by Palestine. They claimed that
Palestinian settlers had &#147;stolen&#148; their lands to bring in Muslims from other
countries to live in housing units subsidized by the Palestinian government. &#147;Since
the signing of the Declaration of Principles, settlement activity has doubled,&#148; they
claimed. &#147;Israeli towns and villages on whose lands these settlements were built are
being threatened by these settlers with daily shootings, abductions, torture and killing
of innocent civilians,&#148; the Israeli representatives claimed. With the &#147;bypass
roads that the Palestinians had constructed,&#148; all Israeli towns are isolated from
each other and their inhabitants have no freedom of movement. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Expressing &#147;outrage&#148; at the use of &#147;excessive force&#148;
by the PDF, and at the violations of the Fourth Geneva Convention in the Palestinian
occupied Israeli territories, the UN Commissioner issued a report which included the
&#147;incident&#148; in which Palestinian settlers shot at her car while visiting the
&#147;shared&#148; city of Modi&#146;im. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In response, the Palestinian Government spokesperson issued a statement
refuting the Commissioner&#146;s report while describing it as &#147;one-sided.&#148;
Palestine has always applied the Convention &#147;de facto&#148; in the disputed
territories, the statement adds. Palestinian civilians have every right to live anywhere
they want in historical Canaan, and the PDF has the responsibility of protecting them. The
spokesperson further stressed the &#147;emotional and spiritual attachment&#148; that
Muslims everywhere have for this Waqf land as part of their heritage and identity. The
bypass roads are essential for the security of Palestinian and Muslim settlers who need to
travel freely in the Israeli territory and to connect with Palestine without being
attacked by Israeli terrorists. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked whether the uprooting of Israeli olive and fruit trees and the
bulldozing of crops were necessary, the Palestinian spokesperson responded that these were
used as &#147;cover&#148; by Israeli terrorists throwing stones at Palestinian settlers
and PDF vehicles traveling throughout the Israeli territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Palestinian civilians are being attacked by Jewish terrorists, and
the roads are no longer safe in light of these latest riots,&#148; he stated. Restrictions
on the movement of Israelis have become a security necessity, and curfews on Israelis are
essential, particularly in shared cities, for the protection of Palestinian civilians.
Haifa, for example, must remain calm, and for the security of the Palestinian population
there and in order to guarantee their freedom of movement, all Jewish inhabitants of this
city must remain under curfew. &#147;We allow them two hours of movement every few days to
let them do their shopping,&#148; declared the spokesperson. &#147;We do take into account
such humanitarian considerations.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Muslim neighbourhood of Jala&#146;, a suburb of West Jerusalem,
residents are being subjected to gunfire from the Israeli town of Beth Hassida. Fatima
Abed, 45, a schoolteacher and mother of six children, had to be taken to hospital for
shock treatment when a bullet struck the living room window of her suburban home. The PDF
tanks stationed there had to shell the town of Beth Hassida in order to silence the
Israeli guns. &#147;We will not tolerate any shooting or Israeli threat to our eternal and
undivided capital, Jerusalem,&#148; the spokesperson concluded. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem, however, remains an issue of contention. For security reasons,
Palestine has closed off Jerusalem (both East and West) to all Israelis, except for those
who are allowed to reside in the city and who had been issued blue identity cards by the
Palestinian authorities. Jewish holders of orange or green ID cards are barred entry, as
well as all vehicles with blue or green license plates&#151;&#147;only yellow license
plates are allowed to enter the area of greater Jerusalem as designated by the Palestinian
cabinet in 1967,&#148; said the spokesperson. Nevertheless, Jewish worshippers are allowed
to reach the Wailing Wall during two major holidays provided they are over 45 years old.
&#147;For security reasons,&#148; however, &#147;they have to be bussed in, and only in
limited numbers.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Jerusalem is open to all religions,&#148; declared the Palestinian
minister in charge of religious affairs. &#147;We have a policy of 100% religious
tolerance and we respect the right to worship freely at all holy sites.&#148; In response
to a question on the closure imposed on Jerusalem since 1993 and the prevention of Jewish
Israelis from entering the city, the minister responded: &#147;This is only a temporary
security measure. The whole world understands that we are living in exceptional
circumstances that require drastic measures.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These are the same &#145;drastic measures&#146; that are used by the
Palestinians to demolish Jewish homes, to confiscate Israeli Jerusalem IDs, to expropriate
Israeli land on which to build Palestinian settlements, and to ban Jewish Israelis from
building on their own land,&#148; claimed an Israeli resident of Jerusalem. &#147;First,
they declare our land as &#145;green areas&#146;, then they refuse to grant us building
permits on the 12% that&#146;s left to us, then&#151;before you know it&#151;Palestinian
settlements are mushrooming everywhere, around and within our city. We cannot move freely
in our own city,&#148; he added. The Palestine government, however, maintains its position
that it can build anywhere in its capital. &#147;We have even built housing projects for
Jews,&#148; claimed the Palestinian minister of housing and construction, himself a Hamas
member of Arafat&#146;s coalition government. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In yet another development, Palestinian President Arafat has issued orders
for the assassination of all Israeli leaders of &#147;terrorist&#148; organizations,
including Shas, the Mifdal, the Likud, and the Hagana militias of Chairman Barak&#146;s
own Labour party. In a moving speech before the inner (security) cabinet, President Arafat
vehemently declared zero-tolerance for the &#147;revolving door policy&#148; of chairman
Barak. &#147;We have repeatedly told him to arrest them and keep them in prison. By
releasing them, Chairman Barak is giving a green light to terrorism against the
Palestinian people. Our cities will be targets for despicable and vicious attacks by
Jewish fundamentalists who are opposed to the peace process. If Barak is to live up to his
commitment to peace, he must prove that he can safeguard the security of all Palestinian
citizens anywhere in Palestine and the territories.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a related move, the PDF Coordinator has issued orders canceling all the
passes and privileges granted to members of the Israeli Authority. Previously, the
&#147;VIP status&#148; granted to such Israeli individuals afforded them freedom of
movement among Israeli towns and cities without being stopped and searched at Palestinian
army checkpoints&#151;a routine measure for all Israelis allowed to move within the
territories. &#147;We had issued around 200 of these VIP passes,&#148; the Coordinator
stated. &#147;Instead of being grateful, members of the Israeli Authority are not living
up to their commitments&#151;they are not controlling the people or reigning in the
Israeli rioters.&#148; Once they stop the violence, the Coordinator promised, they would
regain their privileges. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked about the missile that killed a Labour militia leader and two
middle-aged Israeli women who had been in the street in front of their homes, President
Arafat praised the &#147;precision&#148; of the attack and described it as a
&#147;surgical strike.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;It was a necessary and successful operation,&#148; he boasted.
&#147;These terrorists must learn that they will not be safe anywhere.&#148; In the
meantime, opposition leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin called on President Arafat to arrest and
deport all Israeli leaders and added that Colonel Amram of the Israeli Preventive Security
must himself be assassinated on suspicion of involvement in the latest attacks on the PDF.
President Arafat refused to comment, saying it is enough to &#147;take out&#148; the
Israeli activist leadership. &#147;We shall study the situation and take further measures
as necessary,&#148; he added, thereby keeping the door open for further bargaining with
Hamas in the looming parliamentary crisis in Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aware of the implications of this latest political crisis in Palestine,
and in a bid to help President Arafat overcome the challenge of his rival, Yassin, U.S.
President Clinton gave an interview to Palestine television praising President Arafat for
his &#147;flexibility and generosity&#148; in the Camp David talks and laying the blame
for their failure squarely on Chairman Barak. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Arafat went further than any other Palestinian leader&#148; in
offering the Israelis functional responsibility and personal jurisdiction in the Israeli
part of Jerusalem. &#147;He also expressed a willingness to allow Barak to raise the
Israeli flag on the Holy Synagogue,&#148; Clinton added. Describing the issue as
&#147;largely symbolic,&#148; Clinton asserted that &#147;symbolic solutions&#148; could
be found. As for Palestinian settlements in Israeli territory, these could be grouped into
settlement blocs and annexed to Palestine. United Nations resolution 242 does not mean the
inadmissibility of acquisition of territory by war, he explained. Some territory may be
annexed to Palestine, for Palestinian settlers must be able to live under Palestinian
sovereignty&#150;at least 80% of them. As for the Jewish refugees who had left more than
50 years ago, they can be &#147;generously compensated&#148; and relocated elsewhere.
Clinton concurred with the Palestinian view that the Muslim-Christian character of
Palestine must be maintained, and that the Israelis must be &#147;realistic&#148; in their
demands. &#147;Chairman Barak must go further in meeting President Arafat&#146;s
flexibility,&#148; he added. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Pledging to continue American foreign assistance to Palestine, Clinton
promised to raise the US$ 3 billion granted to Palestine annually, while allocating a
further US$ 800 million to maintain Palestine&#146;s strategic military superiority in the
region and to fund Palestinian withdrawal from some of the Israeli territories. &#147;We
share more than funds and military secrets,&#148; Clinton declared. The Muslim-Christian
tradition and ethos supply us with &#147;values of democracy and human rights and we are
proud to call Palestine (the only democracy in the region) our special ally.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a reciprocal move, President Arafat promised that he would call on the
Muslim and Palestinian-American business community to be even more generous with their
campaign funds and votes in the upcoming American election. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While in the U.S., President Arafat called on Secretary of State Madeleine
Albright and thanked her for her identification with Palestinian suffering. &#147;I
appreciate all your efforts on behalf of peace and democracy,&#148; she responded. Later
in the day, Albright went on national American television admonishing the Israelis for
their &#147;violence&#148; and explaining how Palestine is &#147;under siege&#148; by the
Israelis, particularly &#147;those stone throwers.&#148; She further promised to veto any
draft UN resolution aiming to censure Palestine for its policies and measures in the
Israeli territories. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On his way back to Jerusalem, President Arafat made a brief stop at the UN
to meet with Secretary General Kofi Annan. Mr. Annan asked for a role in the peace
process, promising to maintain &#147;neutrality&#148; and not to be identified with any
Israeli if Palestine and the U.S. would allow him to join the membership of the peace
club. President Arafat promised to think about it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">President Arafat&#146;s last stop was in Europe to meet with the EU
presidency. They made the same request. He gave them the same reply. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, violence continues in the territories and many Israelis
find themselves caught in the crossfire. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">President Arafat remains committed to peace despite his grave
disappointment with Chairman Barak&#146;s inability to control his people or to appreciate
the &#147;generous offer&#148; at Camp David. &#147;I will leave no stone unturned in my
search for peace,&#148; he declared. In an unprecedented move, he openly avowed to
recognize an &#147;Israeli State&#148; on 50% of Israeli territory, provided he can
immediately annex the Palestinian settlement clusters and maintain security control over
the borders of the demilitarized Israeli entity. Jerusalem will remain under &#147;full
Palestinian control over all Jewish holy sites. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whether that will be enough to &#147;clinch a deal&#148; and to save
Arafat&#146;s political career remains to be seen. President Clinton&#146;s peace team
sounded upbeat in their assessment of the chances for resuming talks. On a family visit
during the Eid al-Fitr Holiday, Dennis Ross made a point of holding talks with both
leaders. &#147;It is up to Chairman Barak now to reciprocate the goodwill gestures of
President Arafat,&#148; he declared. &#147;The ball is in his court.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Washington, President Clinton declared himself satisfied with the
progress made so far. &#147;We can clinch this by 20 January 2001,&#148; he announced (in
a veiled reference to his end-of-term date). &#147;President Arafat has a political career
to save; I have a historical legacy to make; and Chairman Barak must show proper
appreciation of this unprecedented opportunity.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Occupied Israeli Territories, the uprising leadership issued a
leaflet denouncing the resumption of talks while Jews were being &#147;massacred&#148;
daily at the hands of the Palestine Defense Forces. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Next Tuesday, 2 January 2001, however, and despite Israeli extremist
statements, Palestinian and Israeli teams will dutifully head to Washington for
&#147;exploratory&#148; talks. The interpreter to the U.S. special envoy to Middle East
Peace Process declared himself &#147;satisfied.&#148; The Israelis will easily
&#147;swap&#148; the Jewish refugees right of return for responsibility over the Holy
Synagogue. For good measure, &#147;we&#146;ll throw in the Jewish Quarter and a
neighbourhood or two,&#148; he added in an optimistic tone. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Chairman Barak must show real leadership,&#148; a senior state
department official said on condition of anonymity. &#147;He must recalibrate,&#148; he
added. &#147;The Israelis never miss an opportunity to miss an opportunity. They cannot
afford to miss this one.&#148; Another official promised to strengthen Barak&#146;s
security forces to quell any protests among the Israelis in the face of rising anger.
&#147;This comes out of our commitment to peace and democracy,&#148; she said anonymously.
&#147;Palestine deserves peace and security at all costs.&#148; Should the Israelis prove
difficult, then they are not worthy of democracy and must be made to comply.
&#147;It&#146;s the least we can do,&#148; she added. &#147;We can help Chairman Barak
reactivate and expand his [military] State Security Courts (as promised by Vice President
Gore), and we will increase our participation in the Security Committees while upgrading
the Anti-Incitement Committee. After all, the security of Palestine is at stake, and
Palestine is no ordinary ally.&#148; What more could the Israelis hope for? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The horror! The horror! </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I appeal to you as one who has also experienced a rebirth in faith. It is
both enlightening and exhilarating to be &#147;born again.&#148; Such a catharsis should

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">When Basboos went to Hajj</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">E.Yaghi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos was a large, marmalade male cat who lived in a Gideon forest.
Early each morning, he would pad softly through the dappled sunlight of his forest home,
silently picking his way through the undergrowth, stopping at frequent intervals to sniff
the air for a tasty morsel of prized white mouse. He was king of his clowder and he ruled
supreme in his imperial forest of Gideon. Later in the day, he would take to a lone stream
and either lay down and stretch himself out or wait for an unwary white mouse to stop by
for a drink. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Basboos had been forewarned to change his habits or he would surely
perish. &#147;My dear imperial sire,&#148; his religious advisor would say, &#147;you
can&#146;t go on like this forever. You must repent your deeds, change your colours and
learn to be kind to the white mice that fear you so. At least if you cannot be kind to
them, don&#146;t eat them.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos regularly patrolled his territory on a daily basis, making sure
that no other feline intruders dare approach his forest kingdom. His religious advisor was
the only male allowed into his territory, but this morning, when he heard the news,
Basboos was outraged and answered in a furious growl, &#147;What, have you taken leave of
your senses? How can I not eat the white mice that pitter-patter everywhere? They are the
tastiest morsels I have ever had the delight to consume.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then as his whiskers twitched nervously and his claws retracted into the
soft earth of his newly built and extravagant den, he squinted his amber eyes and asked
his wise advisor, &#147;And just how do you fill your belly? Don&#146;t tell me you
don&#146;t eat mice at all.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;No, your majesty, I have given up eating mice completely. I went to
Hajj and it is as if I experienced a rebirth. I now, in good conscience, can do no other
living creature any harm.&#148; </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos felt his eyes burn red with anger. &#147;Then just what is it that
you do eat?&#148; </b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Oh, master, I only partake of nuts and berries and when lucky, lap
up whatever spilled milk I might find on the forest floor. I have even taken to the idea
of eating honey. You will see, once you go to Hajj, everything will change.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos noted how sleek his advisor&#146;s coat now appeared. Why, he
thought to himself, it is smoother and softer than ever before. He looked deep into the
eyes of his counsel and for the first time saw a calmness there he had never noticed
before. Lo and behold, the countenance of his advisor was serene and peaceful, even
pleasant to look at for the first time that the monarch could remember. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;How long does it take to go to this Hajj of yours and do you think
there is hope that I can change?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Oh yes, your highness. You will experience a great awakening and
everything will change, your desires, your tastes, your wants in this life.&#148; </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Everything?&#148; </b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Yes, everything.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So it was. Basboos decided to go to Hajj. He was accompanied by some other
feline delegates from neighbouring clowders. After a few weeks of absence, he returned to
his forest domain thinking to himself that indeed he was different. He called for his
advisor and invited his fellow felines over for a welcoming party and announced proudly to
them that, &#147;I have gravely wronged the white mice who share my forest habitat with
me. I have reformed and I am now insisting that my counsel circulate a letter of apology
to all mice who live in the forest of Gideon.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His fellow feline neighbours meowed in approval, and soon after his
reception and confession, a letter was circulated to all the white mice who dwelled in the
forest of Gideon. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The advisor did as he was ordered and in no time, all the white mice in
Basboos&#146;s kingdom read the circular, which was, in truth, an apologetic confession of
his past glutinous habit of devouring any white mouse that happened to cross his path. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos wasn&#146;t sure that the white mice would even believe the
circular, but all he could do was hope and wait and dine on berries and nuts and when he
was lucky, lap up a bit of spilt milk from the forest floor. Berries and nuts weren&#146;t
so bad after all, he thought. At least he wasn&#146;t chomping down any more helpless mice
who squealed whenever he bit through their fluffy white fur and crunched on their tasty
flesh. But wrong was wrong and he was a new marmalade cat. He noticed whenever he stood
hours on end admiring his reflection in the lone stream that trickled through his forest
home that his coat was smoother now and shinier than it had ever been and that his
countenance was almost angelic. He felt good about himself. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One day, one great day, his counsel entered his chambers and announced,
&#147;I&#146;m sorry to disturb you, your highness, but you have a visitor.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos only opened one eye and sleepily squinted at his counsel. He
stretched out his limbs and yawned slightly and then said in a drowsy mew, &#147;Who is
this visitor you speak of?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The white mice have sent an emissary to welcome you, sire. It is an
occasion to celebrate and a test of your endurance and abstinence.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Basboos jumped up. &#147;Yes, you are right,&#148; he purred. &#147;Have
him enter immediately.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suddenly, the most beautiful white mouse that he had ever seen, entered
his palatial den. He was about three inches long with a tail of similar size. His pink
eyes were intent and he did not take them off Basboos as if looking for an answer to his
unasked question. His coat was rich and lustrous and his little nose twitched in
anticipation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Berries and nuts. Bah! What were berries and nuts to a tasty morsel of
mouse? Had he been mad to give up such delights? Just look at this luscious piece of food
so close to him that he could reach out and pounce on it before it knew what hit it.
Unintentionally, his tongue slipped out and licked his jaws and he drooled a bit. But all
Basboos said in a low and restrained voice was, &#147;Welcome, my friend. I am sorry that
I have eaten so many mice in my day and broken up so many micey homes. It is my greatest
wish that you will all forgive me and that we can now be friends and live in peace and
happiness for the rest of our days.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He ended his apology with a long gentle purr as if to convince the white
emissary of his pure intentions. His tail switched up and down a few times as if to
certify his noble intentions. He even stretched out his paw in friendship. But instead,
the mouse scampered away as fast as he could, before Basboos could say or do anything
further. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The white mouse returned to his fellow mice. Basboos&#146;s counsel, who
happened to be picking berries in the same vicinity where the mice lived, overheard the
emissary saying to the other white mice who asked him about whether the monarch had really
conformed or not, &#147;The Hajji went to Hajj but that old glint of mischief is still in
his eye. I did not wait to be his dinner. The way he looked at me and the way he hungrily
licked his jaws were proof enough that nothing has changed.&#148; </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">American elections: System or farce?</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Edward Said</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For over one month, the entire world has been transfixed by the spectacle
of an unresolved U.S. presidential election, as George Bush and Al Gore employed
battalions of lawyers to fight out a very close election in the Florida and U.S. Supreme
courts. What first emerged from the sound and fury of the struggle (awarded finally to
Bush by a very right-wing Supreme Court) is that the U.S. is less a society of laws than
it is a society of lawyers. This is the most litigious country on earth, wherein if you
have enough money and power you can do virtually anything, even win an election when it is
clear that you have lost it. Over $3 billion were spent on the campaign, enough to rebuild
and run an entire school system in a medium-sized American town. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What was at stake, as Ralph Nader pointed out in his finally disappointing
campaign, was a system of spoils and patronage. For each of the two candidates&#150;one
the son of a former president, the other the son of a former senator&#150;the prospect of
the presidency was mainly about power, power that could keep literally thousands, perhaps
even millions, of people prosperous as appointees, employees and lobbyists, as well as
millions more in industry, the military, the bureaucracy and the universities, all of whom
would benefit in one case, and lose out relatively speaking in the other. Thus with the
change to a Republican administration in Washington there will be a return to the city of
the old Reagan and Bush crowd, led by Dick Cheney and James Baker, who seem as if they
have only been biding the time and playing golf while Bill Clinton and his crowd were
running the world. The transfer in sheer wealth and prestige should not be underestimated.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But to return to the law and lawyers: after years of sending U.S.
observers to supervise third world elections on the assumption that America leads the
world in the democratic process, I am surprised that the Congo&#146;s Kabila and
Uganda&#146;s Mugabe didn&#146;t make the suggestion that some of their people be sent to
the U.S. to survey and help to manipulate our elections here. What was revealed in the
unending broadcast news from Florida was that U.S. elections are a frighteningly
antiquated, inequitable and undemocratic hodge-podge of rules and regulations designed to
keep out the poor and disadvantaged in maximum numbers. More important, the American
ideological system&#150;which came dangerously close to breaking down completely&#150;once
again saved the day, papering over and then removing from awareness the fundamentally
jungle-like struggle of all against all that is the underlying reality when it comes to
the power and money of the ultimate prize. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Florida&#146;s inequities were only Florida&#146;s. Had the recounts
begun in Iowa, New Mexico, Wisconsin and Maryland, the whole edifice might indeed have
crumbled, revealing it to be a very poorly held together paper castle designed, in the
final analysis, to keep people from thinking too deeply or too critically. What does it
mean, therefore, for one candidate to have won the popular vote and the other to have won
the election as the result of a decision by a nine-member Supreme Court staffed by five
right-wing republicans voting in favour of their party, with the other four of them
mounting a lustreless defence of principle and equity? That certainly cannot be called
democracy! Nor is this all. What I had never known concretely before was that there is no
uniform federal election code that guarantees the same rights and the same voting
apparatus to each citizen. In Florida, for instance, the State has ruled that no one who
was ever charged with a felony is allowed to vote. This means that about half a million
people, most of them poor and black, were denied the right to vote for the president. In
addition, each county in the State has its own kind of voting machine and style of voting:
this runs the gamut from sophisticated machines to primitive, hand-manipulated pieces of
paper. Discrepancies of every kind are therefore certain. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Plus, one more thing. Particularly in southern States, where the federal
civil rights and voting statutes are not well-enforced, there were many reports of blacks
(families or individuals) who were prevented from voting by white policemen. All sorts of
trumped-up charges were manufactured against them, from driving without a valid license to
failure to register. Since the Democratic Party attracts the vote of indigent and/or
minority voters who are under the impression that the Democrats are more progressive than
Republicans, this meant that Gore lost large numbers of prospective voters to Bush. This
in addition to the 90,000 people in Florida who had voted for Ralph Nader. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As if this isn&#146;t enough to make clear that George Bush had absolutely
no real chance of becoming president except as a result of the physical and political
irregularities of the election as administered in one very unprogressive State, Florida,
whose governor is Jeb Bush, George&#146;s brother, there is also the undemocratic
electoral system which is a legacy of oligarchy and slavery. How it has endured for so
long is inexplicable. The system was originally designed in the 18th century to protect
property and race, so that a popular election might take place, only to be re-ratified (or
not) by a small group of designated electors who would be seen as confirming (or not) the
election results. It is this group that Bush gained to his advantage, even though the
popular vote (one person-one vote) had gone against him. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Is this unusual? Yes and no. It is true that only one other election in
American history made it possible for someone to lose the popular vote and another to
become president, but it is also true that the whole system functions essentially as a
system of control rather than of democratic participation. We shall never know how many
abuses took place in the past. Two percent of the U.S. population owns 80 percent of the
wealth, and to continue maintaining this disproportionality, the majority has either to be
kept under control ideologically or kept out of the system, preferably both. No more than
about 35-40 percent of eligible citizens vote, because the remainder senses, correctly,
that their vote does not mean what it should. What counts is that wealthy candidates can
manipulate both the mechanisms of voting and/or the media (preferably both) and guarantee
the absence of change that has kept the U.S. a country of the very rich supported by a
middle class that aspires, or believes that it can aspire, to the American
&#147;dream.&#148; And it is the survival of this dream with its underlying belief in the
need to perpetuate the system that has kept this country so extraordinarily anachronistic
by comparison with other industrial democracies. No wonder then that the U.S. has
effectively dismantled most of the attributes of the welfare state (absence of health
insurance, social security and labour unions under constant attack, badly funded
educational systems, unceasing complaints about &#147;government spending&#148; on welfare
even as the defence budget has exceeded $350 billion&#150;the largest ever in
history&#150;and extraordinarily punitive prison and police systems). The market rules
over everything without regard for the justice and security to which each citizen should
be entitled. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I do not want to be misunderstood as saying that everyone in the U.S. is
brainwashed. Far from it. What I do want to point out is that (a) the system favours the
rich and powerful (one of the reasons why Bush won was that he spent far more money than
anyone), and in effect works to preserve their ascendancy through a multiplicity of means,
including the electoral and ideological systems, at the same time that the whole world is
filled with the rhetoric of American democracy and freedom, most of it misleadingly
propagandistic; and (b) that in reality there is a constant struggle in America which the
disadvantaged, including women, racial minorities and underpaid workers such as teachers
and nurses, try to wage against the system, with varying degrees of success, but which at
present is mostly a discouraging struggle as the &#147;free&#148; market undermines labour
in favour of the largest employers who are coddled by the government through favourable
tax laws, loopholes in social security payments, and unfair labour practices. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To me, the ideological system is the most interesting case of all. Not
having come to this country until most of my secondary schooling was over, I was first
struck and have continued to be fascinated by how the powerful presence of violence and
conflict in this society is routinely masked and covered up with a more overwhelming
rhetoric and unending stream of pacifying thought, stressing the country&#146;s unity, the
perfection in it of democratic practice and theory, the animating and always benign
influence of the Constitution (which although a secular document reflecting the wealthy,
white, slaveholding, Anglophilic men who wrote it, is treated with the reverence accorded
to scripture by any good fundamentalist anywhere), the completed fulfilment of public
idealism, and the utter benignity of everything about America, always the most exceptional
country that ever existed. I suspect that all this is ingrained in schoolchildren, so that
by the age of 12 or 13&#150;barring the birth of a critical sense in the
individual&#150;most mature Americans tend to believe all this, or at least have little
opportunity in the public domain to voice different sentiments. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Certainly it is absolutely true that in the mainstream, discourse is
heavily policed: alternative or radical or dissenting voices are either kept out
completely or sent to the margins where they have no chance at all of gaining acceptance.
So it was with the elections during the past month. No sooner did the Supreme Court make
its scandalous decision than the commentators began to put the spin out that American
democracy has been restored, national unity established, and so on and on ad nauseam. As
if the flaws in the system were forgettable accidents, and therefore not worth dwelling
on. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And this brings me to my final point, which is the contempt for history
and for rational understanding that underlies the ideological chorus in every one of its
individual manifestations. The subtle question is whether the willing manufacture of
consent is worse or better than censorship by coercion. In the back of the purification of
reality that ideological consent requires is the idea that knowledge of history&#150;the
critical history that articulates the whole truth and violence of American
politics&#150;is to be opposed at all costs as basically disrupting what Foucault and
others have called governability. The moment a large number backs a whole thing, a red
light goes on in the boardrooms of America where the real decisions are made. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Remember that CNN, Time Warner, Disney, NBC, Sky News and the rest are
part of the same ideological system, serve the same clientele, and are owned by the same
relatively tiny group of people whose interest is to keep things as they are. Memory is an
inhibition, a possible threat to their hegemony, just as it is very dangerous for a critic
to keep making connections between supposedly un- or non-political institutions like the
Supreme Court and the Constitution, and on the other hand, base commercial interests. It
can&#146;t have been a mere accident that the main Supreme Court judge, Justice Antonin
Scalia, is a well-known right-wing Republican who wrote the majority opinion in favour of
George Bush (and hence against a complete recount) and who also has two sons working as
lawyers in the very same law firm that represented Bush. Or that Justice Clarence Thomas,
also part of the conservative majority for Bush on the Court, has a wife who worked for
the right-wing Washington think-tank doing studies of people who were being considered for
the Bush cabinet. Or to go from there to Chief Justice Rehnquist, also a Bush supporter,
who was once a well-known election officer blocking possible antagonists from voting
during the election of 1964 in Arizona, one can immediately see that the system is to be
kept functioning no matter how difficult the task or numerous the obstacles. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whether Gore would have been a better president than Bush is a question to
be answered with these constants in mind. For those who voted for Nader, they believe that
only an outsider to the system, a candidate who spoke about making real democracy the
issue, would have made a genuine difference.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Jewish Fundamentalism in Israel</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em> Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky</em></p>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 16</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The National Religious Party and the Religious
Settlers</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Gush Emunim attitude towards Palestinians, always referred to as
&quot;Arabs living in Israel,&quot; is important. Lustick mostly avoided this subject.
Harkabi dealt with it honestly by extensively quoting the statements of Rabbis Tzvi Yehuda
Kook, Shlomo Aviner and Israel Ariel. Kook, Aviner and Ariel viewed the Arabs living in
Israel as thieves; they based their view upon the premise that all land in Israel was and
remained Jewish and that all property found thereon thus belonged to Jews. Harkabi, who
learned this when doing the research for his book, expressed his shock: &quot;I never
imagined that Israelis would so interpret the concept of historical right.&quot; Harkabi
listed in sub-chapters of his book the numerous applications and extensions of this
doctrine. He pointed out that for Gush Emunim the Sinai and present-day Lebanon are parts
of this Jewish land and must be liberated by Israel. Rabbi Ariel published an atlas that
designated all lands that were Jewish and needed to be liberated. This included all areas
west and south of the Euphrates River extending through present-day Kuwait. Harkabi quoted
Rabbi Aviner: &quot;We must live in this land even at the price of war. Moreover, even if
there is peace, we must instigate wars of liberation in order to conquer it [the
land].&quot; It is not unreasonable to assume that Gush Emunim, if it possessed the power
and control, would use nuclear weapons in warfare to attempt to achieve its purpose.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For Gush Emunim, as Harkabi made clear and Lustick indirectly confirmed,
the God-ordained inferiority of non-Jews living in the state of Israel extends to
categories other than life and property. Gush Emunim has developed a foreign policy for
the state of Israel to adopt. This policy stipulates that Arab hostility towards the Jews
is theological in nature and is inherent. The conclusion drawn is that the Arab-Israeli
conflict cannot be resolved politically. This conclusion is supported by Lustick's quoting
the prominent Gush Emunim leader and former Knesset member, Eliezer Waldman:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;'Arab hostility springs, like all anti-Semitism, from the world's
recalcitrance to be saved [by the Jews]&quot;' (pp.77-9). Lustick also quoted other Gush
Emunim leaders who left no doubt about their refusal to enter into political agreements
with &quot;present-day Jewish inhabitants of the land who resist the establishment of
Jewish sovereignty over its entirety.&quot; Lustick quoted Fisch who argued that Arab
resistance could be attributed to Arabs' seeking &quot;to fulfill their collective
death-wish.&quot; Gush Emunim rabbis, politicians and ideological popularizers have
routinely compared Palestinians to the ancient Canaanites, whose extermination or
expulsion by the ancient Israelites was, according to the Bible, predestined by a divine
design. This genocidal theme of the Bible creates great sympathy for Gush Emunim among
many Christian fundamentalists who anticipate that the end of the world will be marked by
slaughters and devastation. Gush Emunim has from its inception wanted to expel as many
Palestinians as possible.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Harkabi quoted the views of Mordechai Nisan, a lecturer at the Hebrew
University in Jerusalem, that were published in the August 1984 issue <i>of Kivunim, </i>an
official publication of the World Zionist Organization (pp. 151-6). According to Nisan,
who relied upon Maimonides, a non-Jew permitted to reside in the land of Israel &quot;must
accept paying a tax and suffering the humiliation of servitude.&quot; In keeping with a
religious text of Maimonides, Nisan, according to Harkabi, demanded that a non-Jew
&quot;be held down and not [be allowed to] raise his head against Jews.&quot; Paraphrasing
Nisan further, Harkabi wrote: &quot;Non-Jews must not be appointed to any office or
position of power over Jews. If they refuse to live a life of inferiority, then this
signals their rebellion and the unavoidable necessity of Jewish warfare against their very
presence in the land of Israel.&quot; Such views about non-Jews, published in an official
publication of the World Zionist Organization, resemble Nazi arguments about Jews. Harkabi
commented: &quot;I do not know how many Jews share his [Nisan's] belief, but the
publication of the article in a leading Zionist periodical is a cause for grave concern.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The three following examples of other articles that appeared in
Hebrew-language newspapers provide additional analyses of NRP and Gush Emunim attitudes.
One of these articles deals with the most extreme group within Gush Emunim, named Emunim
(Being Faithful). Established after the formation of the Rabin government in 1992, Emunim
is led by Rabbi Benny Alon, the son of retired Deputy President of<i> </i>the Israeli
Supreme Court Menahem Alon. Rabbi Alon, quoted by Nadav Shraggai in his September 18,1992 <i>Haaretz
</i>article, stated:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The method of the mid-1970s will no longer work under a government whose
  moral profile is defined by the Meretz Party and whose members' hearts and minds are
  filled with scorn for the entire land of Israel and for Judaism. They not only want a
  Palestinian state without any Jews to be established in the very midst of the land of
  Israel. They also want a secular democratic state to replace the Jewish state of Israel,
  This government is spiritually rotten.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rabbi Alon then contrasted the 1992 government leaders with the Labor
leaders of the mid- 1980s and before, who &quot;felt like warm-hearted Jews feel&quot; and
were thus responsive to Gush Emunim 's pressures. Alon continued, &quot;But you cannot
apply the same methods with the likes of [Meretz MK] Dedi Tzuker or [Meretz member] Moshe
Amirav who coordinate their deeds with our enemies,&quot; In preparing his September 18,
1992 <i>Maariv </i>article, journalist Avi Raz questioned Alon further and discovered
Emunim's tactics:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Emunim wants to discredit Rabin [the then prime minister] by forcing
him to rely [for a Knesset majority] on the MKs from the Arab parties and thus to destroy
the legitimacy of his government.&quot; Rabin and Peres made concessions but nevertheless
insisted upon expanding Jewish settlements. In his article Raz quoted Alon further:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">From the spiritual point of view Rafael Eitan is wrong and should be
  criticized when he justifies Jewish settlements on the basis of helping Israeli's
  security. Security considerations in favor of the settlements are not the point. As I see
  it, politics rest upon spirituality. A body politic needs a soul. Israel's security and
  even the survival of the Jewish nation are no more than material dimensions of the
  spiritual Jewish depth. When we say that we must prevent the formation of a Palestinian
  state in order to save the Jewish state from extinction, we are not talking about
  spiritual things.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Raz observed: &quot;Blessed with profound spirituality, Alon and his
associates go to the United States for five days in order to request Christian
fundamentalists to support financially their activities.&quot; Alon and his associates
succeeded in acquiring some of this requested funding. As Jewish fundamentalists who
abominate non-Jews, they forged a spiritual alliance with Christians who believe that
supporting Jewish fundamentalism is necessary to support the second coming of Jesus. This
alliance has become a significant factor in both US and Middle Eastern politics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second example concerns the policies of Gush Emunim itself under the
Labor and Meretz government of the 1990s. In his October 5, 1992 <i>Haaretz </i>article,
Danny Rubinstein quoted Gush Emunim leaders who believed the goal of Rabin's policies was
&quot;to destroy root and branch the [Jewish] settlements in the territories and all
accomplishments of Zionism.&quot; Rubinstein carefully distinguished between the secular
Golan Heights settlers and Gush Emunim. The Golan Heights settlers claimed that Rabin's
policies were mistaken, because peace with Syria could be reached on Israeli terms. Gush
Emunim claimed that &quot;the Washington negotiations [with the PLO] amount to nothing
else than a dialogue of human beings with a herd of ravenous wolves, aiming solely at
turning the entire land of Israel into the entire land of the Arabs.&quot; This does not
mean that Gush Emunim declined to take money for its own purposes from the government that
negotiated &quot;with a herd of ravenous wolves.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his October 14, 1992 <i>Haarerz </i>article, Nadav Shraggai discussed a
symposium, organized and underwritten by the ministry of religion in conjunction with the
ministry of education, headed by Shulamit Aloni. The symposium's theme was: &quot;Is
autonomy for resident aliens in the Holy Land feasible?&quot; Rabbi Shlomo Goren, the
symposium's major speaker, explained: &quot;'Autonomy is tantamount to a denial of the
Jewish religion.&quot;' According to Goren, the Halacha considers the denial of Judaism to
be the gravest Jewish sin and enjoins pious Jews to kill those infidels who deny Judaism.
Rabbi Goren likened such infidels to those people who advocated autonomy. This indicated
that an attempt to assassinate Rabin would occur for religious reasons. Goren argued
further that Judaism prohibits &quot;granting any national rights to any group of
foreigners in the land of Israel.&quot; Goren also denied that a Palestinian nation
existed. He asserted: &quot;Palestinians disappeared in the second century BC, and I have
not heard of their being resurrected.&quot; Goren reassured his audience that, undeterred
by widespread infidelities, &quot;the process of redemption, already underway for one
hundred years, cannot be reversed when Divine Providence awaits us all the time.&quot;
Another symposium participant, Rabbi Aviner, concurred with Goren that Judaism forbade
granting even a small amount of autonomy to the Palestinians. Rabbi Zalman Melamed,
chairman of the Committee of the Rabbis of Judea, Samaria and Gaza, made the same point
even more clearly:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;No rabbinual authority disputes that it would be ideal if the land
of Israel were inhabited by only Jews.&quot; Rabbi Shlomo Min-Hahar extended the argument
to Muslims and Christians specifically by claiming: &quot;The entire Muslim world is
money-grubbing, despicable and capable of anything. All Christians without exception hate
the Jews and look forward to their deaths.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli taxpayers, including Muslim and Christian Arabs, paid for this
symposium, during which rabbinical leaders delivered such arguments. Prime Minister Rabin
and the ministers of religion and education approved and did not utter publicly negative
criticism of any of the views expressed. Rabin's approval might be understood as a part of
his deliberate encouragement of political programs at variance with what he claimed to
favor. Minister of Education Aloni's approval can be understood rationally only as another
manifestation of her weakness, carelessness and foolishness. Both Rabin and Aloni visited
Germany shortly before this symposium and fiercely condernned publicly the &quot;German
hatred of foreigners.&quot; They carefully avoided mentioning racist statements and
recommendations made by rabbis in Israel about how foreigners should be treated. They did
not mention, let alone condemn, Rabbi Melamed's advocacy of transfer, that is, the total
expulsion of all non-Jews from the land of Israel. Such mention might have complemented
their denunciation of German xenophobia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third example, also taken from the Hebrew press, stems from a book of
responsa, published in 1990. The book, <i>Intifada Responses, </i>written by the important
Gush Emunim rabbi, Shlomo Aviner, provides in plain Hebrew halachic answers to the
questions of what pious Jews should do to Palestinians during situations that arise at
times similar to the Intifada. The book is divided into brief chapters that contain
answers to questions. The answers do not relate to Israeli law. Quotations from the first
two chapters (pp. 19-22) illustrate the essence of the questions and answers contained in
this book. The first exemplary question in Chapter 1 is: &quot;Is there a difference
between punishing an Arab child and an Arab adult for a disturbance of our peace?&quot;
The answer begins by cautioning people not conversant with the Halacha that comparisons
should not be made between Jewish and Gentile underage minors; &quot;As is known, no
Halachic punishments can be inflicted upon Jewish boys below the age of thirteen and
Jewish girls below the age of twelve ... Maimonides wrote that this rule applied to Jews
alone ... not to any non-Jews. Therefore, any non-Jews, no matter what age, will have to
pay for any crime committed. &quot; In providing his answer, Rabbi Aviner proceeded to
quote another ruling by Maimonides that warned Jews not to punish a non-Jewish child who
can be presumed to be &quot;short of wisdom. &quot; Aviner concluded that determining
whether a non-Jewish child is to be regarded as an adult depends upon whether that child,
even if younger than thirteen, has sufficient understanding. According to what Aviner
wrote in his book, any Jew is capable of judging whether a non-Jewish child should in this
sense be considered and punished as an adult. The second exemplary question is: &quot;What
shall we do if an Arab child intends to threaten a [Jewish] life?&quot; Rabbi Aviner
explained that all prior responsa dealt only with the actual commissions of crimes by
non-Jewish children. He explained in this answer that if a non-Jewish child intended to
commit murder, for example, by throwing a stone at a passing car, that the non-Jewish
child should be considered a &quot;persecutor of the Jews&quot; and should be killed.
Citing Maimonides as his authority, Aviner maintained that killing the non-Jewish child in
this instance is necessary to save Jewish life.</p>
