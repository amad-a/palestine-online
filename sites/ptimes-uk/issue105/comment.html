<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#0000FF">Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return must
come first</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> - No true Palestinian patriot can remain silent in
the face of the ominous and sinister plots being devised against the inalienable right of
Palestinian refugees to return to their ancestral homeland from which they were deported <i>en
masse</i> when Israel was created in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, there are those who are actively seeking to circumvent this
inalienable right under a variety of rubrics, all bearing one title: the liquidation of
the refugees&#146; cause and the negation of their right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, a flurry of activity in this regard has been taking place of late.
Numerous conferences, symposia and meetings, some secret while others not-so-secret, have
taken place here in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv, and there in the halls of luxurious hotels in
Europe and North America. And the goal is, innocently enough, &#147;to find practical ways
and means to settle the cause of the refugees,&#148; the enduring cause of the
Arab-Israeli conflict.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These encounters would normally sire &#147;work papers&#148;, &#147;draft
projects&#148; and even &#147;master plans,&#148; all exuding one main substance, a venom
for the liquidation of the refugees&#146; cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is particularly painful, though, is the fact that some of our
so-called intelligentsia, including University professors who have lost their sense of
distinction, are taking part in these suspicious activities, thinking that by so doing
they are serving the Palestinian cause, while in reality they are being accomplices to a
grand conspiracy of lending &#147;legitimacy&#148; to the greatest act of thievery in
mankind&#146;s history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, we started to note of late that these diabolical thoughts
were beginning to reverberate in the minds of some of our writers and journalists who
might misconstrue their follies as expressions of wisdom and political sagacity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Recently, for example, a Palestinian journalist, who writes a daily column
in a semi-official Palestinian daily newspaper in the West Bank, went as far as to suggest
that Israel be asked to allow only a &#147;symbolic return of the refugees&#148; to Israel
while the real &#147;return&#148; would be to &#147;Palestine,&#148; e.g. a prospective
Palestinian political entity in parts of the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The smart columnist, skilful in verbal juggling but miserably poor in
thought, sought to mitigate t the ugliness of his morbid suggestion by demanding that in
return for Palestinians waiving their &#147;collective return to Israel,&#148; the Jewish
State would agree to offer &#147;Palestine&#148; a present on her day of birth, that being
a strip of land linking the West Bank and Gaza Strip.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is this disgusting hallucination? And who gave that journalist the
right to give up, with the strike of a pen, the legitimate and indelible right of return
of close to four million people who are still living on the hope that one day they will be
repatriated to their towns and villages, or at least to the former sites of their towns
and villages, despite the scars of time?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is imperative that we all understand that the right of return is first
and foremost a personal right, and nobody, not a person or a committee or a board or a
government or a State or a leadership or Yasser Arafat, has any right to give up, waive,
or compromise the right of return of a single Palestinian.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is a sacred, paramount right that cannot bear hallucination,
linguistic sophistry, philosophizing, absurdity or morbid reasoning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is an absolute right, recognized and endorsed by all norms and laws,
including UN resolution 194, which guarantees the refugees their right of return and
indemnification.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light of the above, and instead of throwing rancid doubts about the
credibility and applicability of this right, under the effect of despair, frustration, or
sentiments of defeatism, or perhaps under the pretext that political realism requires
compromise, Palestinian writers and journalists are called upon to urge the refugees to
cling to this eternal right.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, we must have the unswerving conviction that whoever was expelled
from Jaffa must be allowed to return to Jaffa, and whoever was expelled from Khulda must
be allowed to return to Khulda, and those who were expelled from Tantura!! must be allowed
to return to their village.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the suggested return of those refugees and their progeny to
&#147;Palestine&#148;, e.g. to the West Bank, would not be in reality a &#147;return&#148;
but a vicious form of settlement and rehabilitation of the refugees, a mere implementation
of the mushrooming plots.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the historical injustice will be far from over, but so
will the struggle for true justice.</p>
