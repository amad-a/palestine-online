<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Declare Oslo is dead!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Musil Shihadeh*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is the best course of action that the Palestinian leadership should
take under the present circumstances. The Palestinian-Israeli negotiations under the
so-called Oslo terms is a farce, as the word negotiations should be replaced by
dictations. How and in what manner could any Palestinian leader dream of getting a fair
outcome when he is negotiating from such a pathetic position of weakness? As long as he
thinks so? No one can deny the fact that Israel is doing more damage to the Palestinian
aspirations for national objectives under the Oslo agreement than without it. Present
settlements are being expanded while new ones are being established, while Palestinian
land confiscation is going on at an increased rate. The Judaization of Jerusalem is a
daily continuing process, while the prospects for the return of the refugees in conformity
with so many United Nations resolutions, starting with resolution 194 in 1949, are being
totally ignored and actually replaced by the old Israeli theme of settling them in their
present host countries. Let us not talk about future borders of the proposed Palestinian
State, because when the Palestinians used to own 93% of Palestine in 1947, they are
desperately struggling to retrieve a maximum of 10%. In other words, Israel is still
committing the same violations of international laws against the Palestinian rights, if
not more, under the Oslo accords than without it. The only difference is that such
violations are committed under the pretext of peace negotiations and thus extracting
legality under the auspices of Palestinian-Israeli peace negotiations with the Palestinian
leadership witnessing and blessing the demise of our national objectives. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course the Palestinian leadership would not waste any time in
rationalizing their continuance to succumb to Israeli demands by declaring to the
Palestinian masses that there are no other alternatives. Do we have other alternatives?
Before one should try to answer such an important question, we should study carefully the
final objectives of Israel in the area. Israel is determined to establish itself as a
normal member of the Middle East community in order to gain economic benefits from its
rich neighbours, while gaining a strategic position so as to become the vanguard of
Western influence and the benefactor in the area, and finally achieve peace to actuate
their theme of the new safe haven for Jews all over the world. In gaining such final
legitimacy they need the Palestinian bridge to cross, without which Israel would remain an
isolated armed castle with no place to go except within itself. In other words, they are
desperate to conclude a peace treaty with the real protagonists, namely the Palestinians,
before they proceed further to acquire different kinds of hegemony over their neighbours.
This is the strong Palestinian card, which the present leadership is contemplating giving
away to the greedy Zionists. From the Zionist point of view there would be no devastation
to their objectives that can exceed the death of the Oslo accords. And why not, when they
are getting more than what they were asking for through peaceful means than through the
status quo that preceded Oslo. Such a route would ensure getting the implicit blessing of
the entire Arab world, which would automatically follow the same steps that the
Palestinians have followed. No Arab government would place itself in any compromising
position when the real protagonists, the Palestinians, have signed a peace treaty with
their enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, our alternative is not to sign such a humiliating peace
agreement until Israel realizes our determination to achieve our national objectives.
Furthermore, the Palestinian leadership should realize that they cannot sign away the
lands of our ancestors, which also belongs to our next generation, without the approval of
a public referendum. The PA is definitely exceeding its jurisdiction in deciding our
rights. The PA should immediately cease all talks with the Israelis, declare a Palestinian
State without borders and leave the final struggle to our next generation. Israel will not
annex the West Bank with more than two and half million Palestinians aboard, because it
would defeat their own supreme goal of Jewish exclusivity. Annexation means giving the
indigenous Palestinians equal human and civil rights not only in conformity with
international laws but their own laws. Such annexation would become an Israeli nightmare
when half of the Israeli parliament would have Arab representatives. There are those, of
course, who claim that Israel might practice such annexation without the indigenous
people, either through further mass evictions or disenfranchisement of those who remain.
Such a horrible scheme is not to be taken seriously when we realize that such views are
espoused by super minorities that follow the Kahana teachings and have failed drastically
to gain any political influence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is time for the PA to declare that Oslo is dead and no more
negotiations with Israel should be contemplated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">A tribute to the martyrs of the Ibrahimi Mosque, the
victims of Jewish terrorism, on the 6<sup>th</sup> anniversary of the massacre</font></i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember what happened in Al-Khalil (Hebron) on that fateful morning
six years ago today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember because it was during the last ten days of Ramadan wherein
Muslims strive harder to get closer to the Almighty and seek His mercy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember how those faithful believers ate their suhour (pre-dawn meal)
and then proceeded to the local Ibrahimi Mosque to offer the morning prayer, not knowing
that many of them would never return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember that as these worshippers bowed before God, the enemy was at
the gate ready to commit his dastardly deed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember Baruch Goldstein, a physician trained to heal the sufferings
of others, and how he betrayed his noble profession by discarding his doctor&#146;s robes
and, wearing military gear, inflicted death on innocent victims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember that as the terror-stricken worshippers attempted to flee for
their lives, Goldstein threw a hand grenade in their midst and then opened fire.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember that as the worshippers fled outside, they were confronted by
waiting Israeli soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember how, as the worshippers struggled to save their lives, three
more were gunned down in cold blood and many more were injured.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember the outrage in the Muslim and Palestinian communities over
this latest in a series of Israeli massacres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember how the Israeli officials dismissed Goldstein as a crazed
individual, thus moving the blame away from themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember how thousands of Israelis and settlers participated in the
funeral of Dr. Goldstein, hailing him as a hero and martyr and chanting &#147;Death to the
Arabs&#148; and &#147;Transfer the Arabs.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember the eulogy given at Goldstein&#146;s funeral when one of the
Kach leaders, T. Pollack, boasted that Dr. Goldstein refused to treat any Arab patient in
his life.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember also at Goldstein&#146;s funeral that one Rabbi stated,
&#147;It is not peace agreements which recover lands, it is blood that recovers
lands,&#148; and how another stated, &#147;The People of Israel were sick and Goldstein
gave us the medication.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember how Goldstein&#146;s admirers set up a shrine in his honour
and visited it by the thousands to offer homage to their &#147;fallen hero.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember our fallen comrades and fellow Muslims today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember them in our dua&#146; (supplications to Allah), and by Allah,
we shall NEVER forget.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember and take comfort in the words of the Almighty Allah which
state: &#147;And say not of those who are slain in the way of Allah, &#145;They are
dead.&#146; Nay, they are living, though ye perceive (it) not.&#148; (2:154)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We remember that our beloved Islam teaches us that the martyrs will be in
the highest levels in Paradise, and we envy their honoured position.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Just a little longer, our beloved fellow believers, and we will join you,
if Allah so wills it. The pain of your loss is heavy in our hearts, but we know that your
suffering is now over for eternity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s Weapons of Mass Destruction:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Will the World Start to Care?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;<i><b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By Ramzy Baroud</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel&#146;s wealth of nuclear weapons is certainly a known fact to many
in the Middle East as well as around the world. Although such a finding was never declared
as a result of an extensive UN investigation, such as the one conducted for years to track
alleged Iraqi weapons, an abundance of evidence and signs give such a claim all that is
needed. However, little if any enthusiasm was ever shown to confront Israel&#146;s
ceaseless pursuit of more weapons of mass destruction which have truly made it the real
threat to the future and peace in the Middle East and probably the world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The exposed Israeli secret is brought up now and then as a result of a
leak of information or the courage of an Arab State daring to challenge the world and
especially the West&#146;s indifference and silence. Egypt was the first to revive recent
criticism of the Israeli nuclear programme. Ossama al-Baz, an advisor to President Hosni
Mubarak, predicted in an Egyptian television interview that &#147;the double-standard
policy of the U.S. regarding Israel&#146;s nuclear arms will change after the
implementation of peace with all the Arab parties.&#148; He explained that &#147;Israel
will then be incapable of repeating that it is a small State surrounded by powerful and
aggressive States.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Al-Baz&#146;s statement was timely, coinciding with Mubarak&#146;s
acceptance of his country&#146;s participation in the multilateral Middle East peace talks
held in Moscow in early February. Earlier talks were doomed to failure and were frozen for
three and a half years as a result of Israel&#146;s refusal to sign the Nuclear
Non-Proliferation Treaty (NPT). Later on, it arrogantly refused to submit its nuclear
facilities to inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Egypt&#146;s campaign was followed by an Israeli parliamentary debate
regarding Israel&#146;s top secret nuclear weapons wherein Arab MP Issam Makhoul warned
the world of up to 300 nuclear warheads currently possessed by Israel. While right-wing
Jewish members tried desperately to distract Makhoul from carrying out his speech, the
determined Arab member managed to get his message through. &#147;All the world knows that
Israel has a vast warehouse of atomic, biological and chemical weapons which serve as the
anchor for the Middle East arms race.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is Shimon Peres, the then-Prime Minister of Israel, who is credited
with advancing Israel&#146;s nuclear weapons programme, whose existence is no longer a
secret, at least for those who bother to listen to Israel&#146;s own leaders&#146; remarks
once confronted with a bold question. The fact that those leaders are quite careless when
speaking of such a subject shows the level of confidence which Israel has in terms of its
&#147;special status&#148; in the eyes of the United States and thereafter the United
Nations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last November, the High Israeli Court permitted the publishing and
distribution of the closed-door trial of Mordechai Vanunu (the Israeli nuclear technician
who challenged the programme&#146;s secrecy and revealed astonishing findings to the
London <i>Sunday Times</i> about Israel&#146;s nuclear capabilities) held in Israel in
1986 after Israeli Mossad agents kidnapped him and shipped him to Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shimon Peres, who is now perceived as a promoter of peaceful
reconciliation between Israel and its Arab neighbours, was angered by the November court
decision. He told the court that his revelations &#147;caused serious damage to Israel and
their publication led certain Arab countries to harden their stance to our
disadvantage.&#148; It is evident from the prominent Israeli leader&#146;s declaration
that the revealing of such documents will make &#147;certain Arabs&#148; able to confront
Israel with its long-ignored weapons of mass destruction.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Iraqi President&#146;s son-in-law Hussein Kamal fled to Amman and
uttered to the press that Iraq is still capable of manufacturing nuclear warheads, the
United Nations was outraged (notice that Iraq was alleged to have the capability of
producing weapons of mass destruction and has not yet obtained these weapons). An
additional team was sent to Baghdad to investigate the findings, and the proud United
States strengthened its arguments and therefore lengthened its sanctions. Everyone had a
reason to believe that Iraq is truly a threat to its neighbours. In Vanunu&#146;s case,
however, the shock quickly faded and the fate of the former Israeli scientist who dared to
speak is an occasional theme embraced by human rights groups every now and then. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Israel&#146;s case, speaking out against Israel&#146;s violation of
international laws and regulations and its threat to the safety of its neighbours is not
enough to pressure the Jewish State into changing its policy. If you simply find those who
have the courage to speak, will you find those with the courage to listen or to act?
Despite all of the clear signs exposing Israel&#146;s weapons programme with massive
destruction capabilities, strangely enough, Israel is maintaining its image as the victim
rather than the bully. It is yet another episode in a long series of Israel&#146;s
influence in a world that acts according to a previously set agenda despite the ethical
values that most countries preach. And it is that influence that helped Israel avoid the
consequences of its greatest crimes, while others are being punished for crimes for which
they were never even indicted.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Peace without normalization</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Syria&#146;s decision to attend the 1991 Madrid Conference marked the end
of one chapter and the beginning of another in its thorny relations with the United
States. The previous 35 years were overshadowed by an array of attitudes ranging from
mistrust, in the best of times, to undisguised hostility in the worst. Reviled and
blacklisted by America among the pariah States of the world, Damascus has, nonetheless,
remained a key address on the road to Middle East peace. Thus, when the Shepherdstown
negotiators failed to sign an agreement based on the Madrid formula&#151;land for
peace&#151;the region seemed destined for yet another round of bloodletting. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from the few set pieces choreographed for the cameras, nothing that
transpired in Shepherdstown reflected movement on the Syrian-Israeli track. Worse still,
there were no gestures of goodwill from any of the parties. While Washington refused even
to consider the removal of Syria from its list of countries that &#147;sponsor
terrorism&#148;, Israel, likewise, spurned the notion of discussing its withdrawal from
the occupied Golan Heights. Yet, as is always the case, it was the Arab side which, for
whatever reasons, chose to concede. For even while sticking to its own position that there
could be no progress toward peace before Israel committed itself to a timetable of
withdrawal, Syria, nevertheless, dropped one of its key demands&#151;that Mr. Barak honour
the commitments given by former Prime Minister Rabin in previous negotiations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The full significance of this latest hot-and-cold in Syrian-Israeli
negotiations can, perhaps, best be understood in the light of Israel&#146;s final status
talks with the Palestinian Authority. Coinciding as it did with the deadlocked
Palestinian-Israeli talks, the Shepherdstown encounter inevitably fuelled much
speculation. Many interpreted it as a tactical manoeuvre intended to force the hand of the
Palestinian leadership. One view actually asserted that a major breakthrough with Syria
will not only reduce the threat of war, but would also enable Israel to avoid conceding
fully to the Palestinians. And, in the final analysis, that the Palestinian issue would
become more of a local dispute rather than a regional or international problem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As the secret initiatives and exchanges continue behind the scenes,
tension is fast rising on the streets. Recurrent calls by senior Western officials for
both sides, Israelis and Palestinians, to make hard decisions have further complicated
matters, particularly at this point when the future of Jerusalem and 5 million refugees is
being discussed. All things considered, neither the return of the Golan Heights, the West
Bank or even a withdrawal from southern Lebanon would create the normalization that Israel
so desperately needs. This is because the rights of the people who suffered most
throughout the conflict are still not recognized. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Peace between rulers</b><br>
</font>Speaking at the recently concluded meeting of Foreign Ministers of the Multilateral
Steering Group of the Middle East Peace Process in Moscow (1 February 2000),
America&#146;s Secretary of State tried to gloss over affairs and give the most promising
assessment of the current situation. To illustrate her point, she announced that the
&#147;Palestinian refugees are being trained in advanced computer technologies.&#148; How
many refugees are being trained and where was this important education conducted still
remain a mystery. For while the suave Ms. Albright was speaking, Palestinian officials in
the West Bank were sounding the alarm of an imminent eruption in the camps. The immediate,
though not the only cause poised to shatter their patience is the excessive cuts by UNRWA
of workers&#146; wages as well as social and relief services. Under the circumstances, one
wonders what good would advanced computer technology serve after the refugees were
overtaken by chronic illnesses and disease caused by rampant malnutrition and the
conversion of their camps into veritable garbage dumps following the walk-off by
sanitation workers whose wages were cut by the Agency. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ephraim Halivi, head of the Israeli external intelligence agency, Mossad,
significantly, presented a more realistic portrait of the current situation. He bluntly
told a meeting of Israeli diplomats stationed in Arab countries that a comprehensive peace
will not be attained at this present stage because all the agreements signed to date are
simply arrangements between individual Arab rulers and the Israelis. This growing
realization within Israel has, consequently, led the country&#146;s foreign ministry to
take a step backward and terminate the use of the term &#145;normalization&#146; in its
internal documents which describe relations with Arab States. Since its adoption after the
Camp David Treaty, the term has failed to mirror the true nature of relations between
Israel and its neighbours. As a result, an internal memo recently circulated to Israeli
foreign ministry personnel called for the term &#145;normalization&#146; to be replaced by
the phrase &#145;good neighbourliness.&#146; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite the outward pretenses of change, the State Department has also
come to the same realization, albeit privately, that the term &#145;normalization&#146;
has proven to be utterly obsolete and meaningless in the context of Middle East peace.
Hence the working paper presented to the Israelis and Syrians in Shepherdstown spoke only
of &#145;good neighbourliness&#146; and not &#145;normalization&#146;. After 20 years of
self-deception, the White House, it appears, has finally recognized that to the vast
majority of Arabs, its magic word &#145;normalization&#146; is seen as synonymous with
Israeli greed, expansion and hegemony. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Syria and the refugees</font></b><br>
Far away from Shepherdstown, the Syrian-Israeli conflict continues to wreak havoc not on
the Golan Heights but in neighbouring Lebanon. There, the innocent victims are Lebanese
civilians and Palestinian refugees. Ever since the slaughter of 3,000 refugees in Tel
el-Za&#146;atar in 1976, the Palestinians have suffered untold human losses in Lebanon.
For their part, Israeli leaders have generally held the view that if Syria is weakened
militarily and even expelled from Lebanon, they would be able to complete the imposition
of a regional peace based on their terms. Itamar Rabinovich, Israel&#146;s former
Ambassador to Washington&#151;now chief negotiator with Syria&#151;confirmed this thinking
when he was asked by IDF radio whether the main address for the 1996 Qana massacre was
Lebanon. He replied, &#147;I think the effective address is Syria.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With respect to the refugee question, Syria has from the beginning and
throughout the Madrid process maintained its support for Palestinian repatriation. Today,
the Palestinians in Syria (465,662) constitute 10.7% of the total number of refugees
registered with UNRWA. Since 1956, the authorities in Damascus have legislated a number of
laws that facilitated their absorption into the economic and social life of the country.
Hence, with the exception of the right to vote in parliamentary elections, they have
enjoyed the same civil rights as their Syrian counterparts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quite bizarrely though, the absence of social discrimination against the
Palestinians in Syria has prompted certain elements within the Israeli establishment to
suggest that Syria would be a good option to resettle some of the refugees. To preempt
such an eventuality, Syria enforced a number of administrative measures. Foremost among
these has been the introduction of entry restrictions on Palestinians with Egyptian,
Jordanian and Iraqi travel documents. In Lebanon, the Syrian response was further
accentuated by the enforcement of a <i>cordon sanitaire</i> around the camps, notably Ain
el-Hilweh, the largest in southern Lebanon. The previous overtures by President Lahud and
Prime Minister Hoss to accommodate a limited renewal of Fatah influence in the camps were
suddenly suppressed after the Barak administration stepped up its diplomatic campaigns in
the region.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though agreeing to attend the Shepherdstown talks, Syria has yet refused
to participate in the Multilateral Working Group. In explaining their boycott of the
Moscow meeting&#151;the first in eight years&#151;the Syrians argued that participation
would only bring the Jewish State closer to its objective of normalization and acceptance
within the regional system. And this would, furthermore, amount to an undeserved reward
for the State that has relentlessly pushed the region closer to war by its occupation of
Arab lands and attacks upon their civilian populations. Accordingly, the Syrian position
remains one of denying Israel the strategic, political and economic advantages it seeks
from peace until such time that it withdraws completely from Arab territories and restores
the usurped rights of their peoples. On the question of Palestinian national rights,
observers note with deep misgivings that Prime Minister Barak still refuses to speak of a
&#147;Palestinian State&#148;, choosing instead to describe it always as the
&#147;Palestinian entity.&#148; </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Negotiating peace in the arms bazaar</font></b><br>
As it appears, Zionist leaders tend very often to ignore causes and emphasize only effects
in their relations with non-Jews. Mr. Barak is no exception. He believes theirs is a
conflict with the Arab countries more than it is with the Palestinians. Hence, in the run
up to Shepherdstown, he declared that United Nations resolution 242 applied only to the
Arab States and not to the Palestinians. Rightly or wrongly, the truth is the Jewish State
has spent the entire last 50 years confronting its neighbours. Ruled as it is by retired
and serving army officers since its creation, Israel cannot, therefore, continue much
longer along this course if it is to develop and achieve genuine economic independence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For the moment, though, it must carry on milking the West. The peace
process, like the holocaust, has proven to be an exceptionally lucrative enterprise.
Negotiating venues have thus become bazaars where the merchants of peace sell
state-of-the-art weapons. All in the name of security, diplomats are urged to devise plans
to subjugate the weak and empower the strong. Mossad&#146;s chief, Ephraim Halivi,
confirmed this when he informed Israeli diplomats that as long as a broad peace between
the peoples of the region is not attained, the basic guarantee of peace would rest in the
strengthening of Israel&#146;s military power.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Having lost at the negotiating table more than it ever did on the
battlefield, the PLO must now double its efforts to safeguard the rights of the refugees.
Increased cooperation with the host countries is both the natural way and necessary means
toward this end. Their adoption has become all the more imperative in the wake of
Israel&#146;s strategy to localize and diffuse the refugee problem through separate
agreements with Syria, Jordan and Lebanon and thereby escapes its international
obligations. By design, all the conventions on refugee issues codified since 1940
emphasize the principle of repatriation. They have been used to resolve refugee problems
in Vietnam, El Salvador, Guatemala, Rwanda, Bosnia and Kosovo. On what basis, therefore,
must the Palestinians be denied and coerced to relinquish their right of return?! </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"></i><font color="#FF0000">On Resolution 181 and 194</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><i> Musil Shihadeh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many readers are not well acquainted with the United Nations resolutions
that created the Jewish State. The UN Partition did not give the green light for the
Zionists to grab the land that was allotted to them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even though UN resolution 181 is beyond the jurisdiction of the UN
Charter, making it illegal for the World Body to even vote for such a resolution, we, in
the spirit of peace, should insist on implementing such a resolution, as it represents the
closest legal framework for peace for all the people in Palestine. It is very important to
understand such an internationally acclaimed resolution in order to understand all the
ramifications stemming from such a declaration. UN resolution 181 does not divide the land
between Jews and Palestinians as much as it draws a map of two spheres of influence. The
land was already inhabited and owned by the indigenous people before such a resolution
came into existence. Palestine was not an &#147;empty&#148; land that had to be divided
between two conflicting groups who just newly arrived to the area, but already inhabited
and owned by the individual people who lived on the land for so long. It&#146;s irrelevant
if such land was under the sphere of the British as their role has been colonial and
temporary. Throughout history, Palestine attracted the appetite of many colonials, who
conquered and invaded the land, but their presence was that of a military one and the
invaders knew that the people under all these invasions remained entrenched in their homes
and properties despite the unwanted presence of these colonialists. I do not recall an
event in history when the conquering invaders practiced uprooting of the indigenous people
and replacing them with their own new foreign people, except in the tragic case of the
Zionists&#146; invasion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The UN Partition plan, embodied in resolution 181, divided the area
geographically into two States, but prohibited either State from evicting anybody from one
State into the other, be it Jew or Arab. This should logically mean, according to the
resolution, that the Jewish State would have a majority of Arabs living under its
influence while over 90% of the land would still remain under the control of the Arab
owners. In essence creating such a &#147;Jewish&#148; State would become a farce, since
land and people were a majority of non-Jews. If democracy, as demanded by the UN, was
implemented, the proposed Jews would have a majority representation in the Jewish State
government, which would have probably limited the unbalanced massive Jewish immigration in
a manner proportional to the ratio of Arabs to Jews, favouring the Arabs in this case.
Most countries in the world adopt a two-thirds majority to pass such immigration laws,
making it virtually impossible for the newly formed government in Israel to enact laws
that would favour un-proportional Jewish immigration. In other words, the honest
implementation of resolution 181 would have only given a Jewish label to the Jewish State
while the facts on the ground would keep it in Arab hands. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, the early Zionists knew that and also knew such a Jewish State
would not survive as Jewish unless the Arabs were evicted, or at least were made a small
minority on their own lands. Such an objective has been reiterated in most of the Zionist
conferences on Palestine, but was kept a secret so as not to jeopardize the world&#146;s
acceptance of such a travesty. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such logic debunks the famous Zionist claim that Israel&#146;s violation
of the same resolution that brought them into existence was a result of Arab and
Palestinian rejection of the UN Partition plan. In other words, uprooting the Palestinians
from their homes and properties were exigencies of the 1947-1948 wars that ensued and not
because of any pre-meditated Zionist plans. Again, the Palestinian rejection of the UN
plan was an excuse, and many Zionists considered it the greatest gift handed to them on a
silver platter by the Palestinian victims, not because Palestinian acceptance or rejection
of the resolution would have made any difference to the Zionists as much as it would have
protected their image in the eyes of the world. The Israeli &#147;new&#148; historians and
much documentation from the Zionist files finally recognize these facts. It would be quite
normal for people everywhere to flee temporarily calamities that hit them such as
earthquakes, floods and wars, but it would also be normal that the same people would
return to their homes and properties when these calamities were over. Recognizing this
fact, the UN adopted resolution 194 in 1949 giving the rights of the Palestinians to
repatriation or compensation. Such rights are not negotiable since their legality stems
from all international conferences, including the very Charter of the UN, which has
accepted Israel&#146;s membership into the World Body based on its commitment to abide by
all the items of the UN Charter.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian sacred right to return then is not subject to public
polls, or negotiations, but should be immediately implemented in conformity with
international law. Israel&#146;s rejection to abide by international law should prompt the
Palestinian leadership to immediately cease all contacts and negotiations with the Zionist
regime and seek other alternatives that would force Israel to accept international
legality. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">When will the American-Zionist holocaust<br>
against the Iraqi people come to an end?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">By Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, over half a million Iraqi children have perished as a direct
result of the lingering sanctions imposed on Iraq by the United States (through the United
Nations Security Council). Needless to say, the sanctions have impoverished and ruined
Iraq in every conceivable sphere. The general Iraqi infrastructure has been virtually
destroyed, and the hospitals, clinics and primary health-care centres have all fallen to
disrepair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Huge numbers of other Iraqis have also died since the second Gulf war
owing to the occurrence of abnormally high rates of cancer, which experts impute to
depleted-Uranium shells used by U.S. forces against Iraq during the Desert Storm campaign.
These and other lethal kinds of weapons apparently contaminated and polluted the Iraqi
soil and water, and caused a variety of new syndromes which had not been known before. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In brief, it can be safely said that the American-Zionist administration,
through the wanton and unbridled use of force, and the adoption of a policy based on the
arrogance of power, hegemony and global insolence, is carrying out a massive and
systematic extermination of the Iraqi people, in total callousness and total disregard for
humanitarian considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In clear language, this means that the morally corrupt Clinton, whose
Zionist administration is full of hate for everything and anything Arab or Islamic, is
hell-bent on killing as many Iraqis as possible, all for the purpose of satiating the
cannibalistic instincts of Clinton&#146;s Zionist executive generals and secretaries, in
particular Madeleine Albright, William Cohen, Samuel Burger, Aaron Miller, Martin Indyk
and Dennis Ross.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They, in reality, are no different than Adolph Hitler and his generals,
who killed and incinerated innumerable people, Jews and non-Jews, during the Second World
War.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Killing is killing, and a mass extermination is a mass extermination,
irrespective of the identity of the perpetrator and irrespective of the identity of the
victims.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thanks to the American-Zionist sanctions, Iraq, from north to south and
from east to west, has effectively become a huge concentration camp, very much like
Aushwitz, and other Nazi concentration camps.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The deaths, as manifested in the sheer number of the victims, the misery,
the wretchedness and the macabre suffering, all say one thing: what is happening in Iraq
is a silent holocaust. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Iraqis die of hunger, of illness, and of poverty, all resulting from
the crippling sanctions. And, as indicated above, the number of deaths increases
astronomically, and the mass funerals take place on a daily basis. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This happens at a time when the entire world, including the Arab and
Muslim population, is dead silent, as if their hearts have been hardened to stones.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Great Satan, as the late Imam Khumeini rightly described the United
States, erroneously claims that the sanctions are aimed at forcing the Iraqi leadership to
comply with UN Security Council resolutions and (the real goal) create the appropriate
conditions conducive to toppling the regime in Baghdad. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The American Secretary of State unashamedly indicated that the achievement
of these goals justifies the mass extermination of Iraqis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;If this is the price, I believe it is worth it,&#148; so said the
evil lady who is morally responsible for the death of a half million Iraqi children, at
least as much as anybody else, if not more than anybody else.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The American-Zionist administration, the CIA, the Mossad, even the
mentally retarded, realize quite well that the Iraqi people, decimated and debilitated by
hunger and poverty and sinister repression by the regime, are too frail, too exhausted,
too hungry and too ill to overthrow Saddam Hussein, who is surrounded by a powerful
security apparatus that mercilessly liquidates its opponents and critics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given this terrifying situation, one has to face the following inescapable
question, which the U.S. government has been trying its best to circumvent and evade: If
the Iraqi people cannot get rid of Saddam (even if they wanted to), then why does the
U.S., along with obsequious Britain, continue to exterminate Iraqis? Why?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that the Iraqi people are the premier victim of the despot
Saddam Hussein, who tormented and humiliated the Iraqis as nobody else had ever done
before. But, if this is true, and it is true, and the truth of it actually transcends
reality, then why does the world&#146;s last remaining superpower continue to further
punish the victim by starving it to death?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why does the U.S. continue to kill, directly, indirectly, or vicariously,
helpless and hopeless Iraqi men, women and children whose only &#147;crime&#148; is their
being in the wrong country, under the wrong leader, at the wrong time? Isn&#146;t America
ultimately responsible for the continuation of this massive genocide, which should
transcend politics and political and strategic calculations?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is inescapable again to call the spade a spade, especially when we find
it in the hands of the Iraqi children&#146;s grave-diggers, the American administration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That genocidal administration simply seems bent on destroying Iraq, its
population, its economics, its environment and even its culture, all for the sake of
appeasing and pleasing Israel and its Jewish lobby in Washington, and also, perhaps, in
order to coerce Iraq into joining the peace process and allow the settlement of hundreds
of thousands of Palestinian refugees as part of the American-Israeli plan to liquidate the
enduring Palestinian refugees&#146; cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We are not saying that every American is a criminal murderer because of
the American administration&#146;s responsibility for the Iraqi holocaust. However, there
is no escape considering every American, and for that matter every Briton, and every
conscientious human being, is morally responsible for the enduring genocide. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The American Zionist lobby is particularly responsible for the lingering
sanctions since it has been at the forefront of those pressure groups resisting the
lifting of the sanctions in order to serve its own sadistic and racist political
expediency, namely to punish Iraq, as a nation, for its hostility toward Israel. This
ghoulish lobby is simply avenging the bombing of Israel by the Iraqi scud missiles ten
years ago by exterminating Iraqi children.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What is that lobby waiting for? When the number of victims reach six
million?</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is clear that Iraq will not pose a serious threat to Israel even after
50 years. Even if the lifting of the sanctions would rehabilitate the Iraqi State, does
that justify this genocidal extermination of innocent Iraqis?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a savage, bestial world that raises a big outcry at the inclusion of
the Austrian Freedom Party leader Jorge Haidar into that country&#146;s government, and
yet plays deaf and dumb in the face of the avoidable and preventable death of half a
million children. It is an immoral world, very immoral, indeed.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians learn from Jospin's misadventure</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">By Danny Rubinstein</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian storm that erupted over French Prime Minister Lionel
Jospin's anti-Hezbollah comments caught the Palestinian Authority's leadership by
surprise. They had not anticipated such a mass outburst of anger.What did Jospin actually
do to warrant such a lashing, be it the stone-pelting at Bir Zeit University, or the
raging demonstrations at other universities on the West Bank? Jospin has never been
considered an enemy of the Palestinians. For years he has supported the Palestinian right
to statehood, and he reiterated this commitment during a news conference in Jerusalem.
When the French prime minister arrived in Gaza, he spoke to Yasser Arafat about how he had
supported the Palestinian leader during the Lebanon War, and throughout the siege on
Beirut. Speaking to reporters in Gaza, Jospin recalled, &quot;I was a friend of Arafat's,
and I visited him when nobody wanted him as a friend.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet Jospin and his Palestinian hosts both made the same fatal mistake.
They did not grasp the degree to which support for Hezbollah has soared recently among
Arab masses in general, and among Palestinians in particular. In retrospect, it appears
that by uttering two sentences characterizing Hezbollah fighters as terrorists, Jospin
trampled on sacred ground.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian admiration for Hezbollah today can be compared to Palestinian
veneration a decade ago for Iraq President Saddam Hussein. As in Hussein's case ten years
ago, Hezbollah has emerged today as the only force in the Arab World which is brazenly
defying Israel. Hezbollah Shi'ite fighters in South Lebanon have come to symbolize Arab
pride, their status enhanced when compared to the hapless PA leadership or the images of
humiliated Arab leaders being compelled to submit to Washington's bidding. Hezbollah has
shown the world that a willingness to sacrifice, determination, courage and belief are
potent antidotes to past failure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This week, the principal of a Ramallah high school described how students
worship Hezbollah fighters and consider them quasi-divine. As the students see it, a few
dozen devout Muslim warriors have been making a laughing-stock out of the Israel Defense
Forces. Raising the standard of Jihad, Hezbollah has foiled the Middle East's strongest
army, whose frightened soldiers are howling with fear, begging to be taken out of Lebanon.
And, as the Palestinians see it, Hezbollah has displayed high moral scruples, abiding by
standards of &quot;purity of arms.&quot; Hezbollah confines its attacks to enemy soldiers,
documenting its strikes with television footage which inspires awe. This is a perception
of heroism commanding respect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then, along comes Jospin, branding Hezbollah fighters as terrorists. How
could he say such a thing? This question has been posed throughout the West Bank and the
Gaza Strip this week. The Bir Zeit outburst against Jospin was spontaneous, as were mass
demonstrations staged in Hebron, Bethlehem, Nablus and Ramallah. Similar protests, which
featured the burning of pictures of Jospin and of Israeli Foreign Minister David Levy,
flared as well in Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Arab television networks showed Hezbollah leaders saluting the
students at Bir Zeit University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aware that his remarks at the Jerusalem press conference last Thursday had
unwittingly prompted a surge of rage, Jospin arrived at Bir Zeit two days later and tried
to control the damage in his lecture at the law faculty. He told his listeners that France
denounces the Israeli conquest in southern Lebanon. Such backtracking proved to be of
little avail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Students waited for the prime minister outside the lecture hall,
distributing circulars accusing Jospin of &quot;spilling the blood of Lebanese
children&quot; to advance his own political ambitions in France. Similarly, Palestinian
newspapers hinted that Jospin had directed his anti-Hezbollah remarks at powerful world
Jewish lobbies, with the aim of raising his electoral prospects in France.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the stone-throwing incident, Arafat launched some damage-control of
his own to try and patch up things with Jospin. The Palestinian leader summoned Bir Zeit
University President Hanna Nasser and the two, together, apologized to the French prime
minister. Other Palestinian spokesmen denounced the rock-throwing episode at Bir Zeit, but
they used cautious language. Being too vehement would have been impolitic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is easy to see which way the winds are blowing in Gaza and the West
Bank. Few Palestinians seemed particularly upset about the attack against Jospin, many
among the Palestinian public even praised the student attackers. PA council members passed
a resolution condemning Jospin's comments, and upholding Lebanese resistance to the
Israeli conquest as being legitimate.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat struck the same chord. Jibril Rajoub, the head of the PA preventive
security service on the West Bank, rejected Jospin's remarks openly, deriding them for
failing to draw a distinction between conquerors and victims in South Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yet more strident were spokesmen from Hamas and left-wing Palestinian
opposition groups. &quot;We are certain that the way to Palestine, and the way to liberate
Lebanon and the Golan, is to use Hezbollah's method, the method of resistance,&quot;
declared a defiant petition circulated two weeks ago by prominent left-wing Palestinians,
including former Nablus Mayor Bassam Al-Shaka, and Dr. Khaider Abad Al-Shafi.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite this torrent against Jospin's statements, Arafat had no choice but
to respond severely to the Bir Zeit demonstrators. Student protests in recent days, along
with a series of other incidents, have reinforced the perception that events on the ground
in the PA territories are spinning out of control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A tumultuous demonstration held a week ago by striking school teachers in
Hebron furnished evidence of mounting chaos. The same could be said of local disturbances
which have flared up recently in Bethlehem, Ramallah, and elsewhere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There is no exact information about the number of Bir Zeit students
detained as a result of the stone-throwing incident. PA security officials allude to a
figure of 30, but university officials talk of a much larger number, saying more than 100
students have been arrested.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Studies at Bir Zeit were suspended officially by the university's
administration for three days. This three-day period has come and gone, but as of
Wednesday classes were still not in session there.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the meantime, police have beefed up their presence on campus out of
concerns over the possibility of renewed riots. Lecturers and students have vowed not to
return to the classroom until detained students are released from custody. Their vow has
stirred more ferment on campuses throughout the West Bank leading concerned Palestinian
university presidents to meet with PA Minister of Higher Education Munzer Salah to express
their worries.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Campus unrest prompted Brigadier General Ghazi Jabali, head of the
Palestinian police, to release a public announcement on Tuesday stating that any public
assembly or demonstration would require a special permit. Anyone who holds a protest
without permission and violates this order, is subject to a harsh punishment of two months
imprisonment, or fines of 50 Jordanian dinars. Asked by foreign correspondents whether he
had published this statement to intimidate the students, Jabali replied, &quot;No, I just
wanted to refresh the public's memory.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yesterday, a Bir Zeit student who lives in East Jerusalem stated that some
of his friends have received a notice saying that they have been expelled from the
university, due to their participation in Saturday's riots and their attempt to physically
harm the French prime minister. They were also informed that they would not be allowed to
study at any other Palestinian university.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This student mentioned rumors that his expelled peers have already
received phone calls from institutions of higher education in Damascus and Beirut,
inviting them to enroll, and even offering them attractive scholarships. With hindsight,
it appears that Arafat and his aides should have been able to anticipate the sequence of
events, perceiving the upsurge in Hezbollah's popularity among the Palestinian public as a
result of the Shi'ite organization's recent military successes against Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Switching historical analogies, one Ramallah-based Palestinian journalist
compared current admiration for Hezbollah not to the veneration Saddam Hussein commanded
during the Persian Gulf crisis, but rather to the respect won by insurgent Palestinian
resistance forces after the 1967 war. After the national armies of the Arab states were
routed humiliatingly by Israel in a mere six days, it was these Palestinian guerrillas who
restored some measure of Arab pride.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat, more than anyone, can grasp this analogy. With a virtuoso public
relations twist, he managed during that post-Six Day War period to convert one day of
fighting in March 1968 in the Jordan Valley into the &quot;Palestinian Stalingrad.&quot;
Masses in vanquished Arab states, and the despondent Palestinian public in 1967, came to
revere the Arafat-led Palestinian resistance movement, just as they admire the Lebanese
resistance today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Unable to measure the mood of the Palestinian public by such historical
standards, France's prime minister paid a steep price, becoming the butt of violent,
vituperative criticism in the Arab world, and in his country. For the Palestinian
leadership, a lesson might be extracted from Jospin's Middle East misadventure. The
Palestinian public, it appears, is inclined to favor a determined, violent struggle of the
sort waged by Hezbollah, losing patience with what it increasingly perceives as a policy
of accommodating humiliating compromises dictated by Israel. </p>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Samuel Huntington</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Review by Dr. Sulayman S. Nyang</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the end of the Cold War, Western strategists have spent a great deal
of their time on the nature of the emerging world order. Francis Fukuyama&#146;s <i>End of
History, </i>Paul Kennedy&#146;s <i>The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers, </i>and several
other seminal works have attracted the attention of scholars, politicians, and members of
the reading public around the world. Each of these texts is a sampling of intellectual
fruits by one strategist or another who is preoccupied with the present state of affairs
in the world. The collapse of the former Soviet Union and the fragmentation of the old
coalition against that ideological empire have combined to heighten the need for a new
world order. This book by Professor Samuel Huntington is the latest addition to the
growing list of works trying to decipher the future course of international relations. It
is an elaboration of an earlier article on the same subject published in the Summer, 1993,
issue of <i>Foreign Affairs, </i>an important forum for debates on U.S. foreign policy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before we go to the discussion of how significant this work is in the
universe of American strategic thought, let us examine the author&#146;s rationale, given
in the first chapter, for writing this book. In that part of the book Professor Huntington
argues for a new paradigm in international relations theory. Contending that the
post-Cold-War period begs for a new way of looking at and explaining politics among
nations, and convinced that he has worked out a formula for those who engage in world
politics, especially his Western leaders, he points to the inadequacies of the rival
theories, while acknowledging their explanatory value. The rest of this review will be
directed to the examination of his ideas and how they can be understood in terms of four
categories of significance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Huntington&#146;s book is significant in four important respects. First,
the book has changed the nature of political definition of conflicts in the international
system. It has also introduced a new way of looking at and interpreting political affairs
between states. Instead of looking at international relations through the lens of
nation-states, he now urges us to begin a new way of looking at conflicts in the world
system. For him the national state is still an actor of note, but its behavior and
activity could best be interpreted and analyzed from the perspective of
inter-civilizational relations. That is to say, according to Huntington, the global system
is now going to be driven more by civilizational motives and interests than by the
traditional factor of national interest only. Or to put his points in a more positive way,
one can say that, in Huntington&#146;s view, the old idea of national interest should be
expanded a bit to embrace the collective interest of fellow members of a given
civilization. This widening of the political net to include all partners within a given
civilization, has serious consequences for world politics and for the big and small powers
that are jockeying for influence around the world. Using his markers to demarcate the new
configuration of political forces in the world, Professor Samuel Huntington has
interestingly carved the world into eight possible centers of civilization. These are the
Chinese, Islamic, the Hindu, the Japanese, the Latin American, the Orthodox-Christian, the
Western, and the African.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This division of the world, if accepted by the political leaders of the
planet, could transform significantly the way we all view the international system. The
implication of such an approach to understanding and dealing with global affairs is that
men and women in the post-Cold-War world are likely to fight each other not only because
of race, language, ethnicity, and religion, but also primarily because they belong to
different civilizations. That is to say, our civilizations are cultural wombs that fashion
us so that we cannot rise to the level of self-transcendence individually and
collectively. And because we cannot transcend ourselves individually and collectively, we
end life and die without ever crossing the cultural and civilizational lines separating us
from the other members of humanity, who are trapped forever within the solid walls of
their own civilizations. By conceptualizing the world system in this manner, Professor
Huntington makes it categorically clear to the students of international relations that
henceforth Mankind would suffer more by inter-civilizational rivalry and conflict than by
the age-old wrangles over national interest. It is this perspective that makes the work of
Huntington significant and interesting. What he proposes as a new and viable paradigm, if
accepted by the powers that be in the West, would implicitly or explicitly warrant the
creation of a Security Council for Human Inter-Civilizational Affairs. <i>Such a political
arrangement would resurrect the old notion of collective security and the politics of the
balance of power.</i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second significance of this book lies in its understanding and
interpretation of world affairs. The perspective is both Euro-centric and tempocentric.
That is to say, the author apparently seeks the best ways to guarantee the continued
dominance of the Western countries in the affairs of men. His world view is built on the
assumption that the peoples of the Euro-American world have dominated world affairs for
several centuries, and that they should develop new and changing strategies to protect
themselves from their current rivals and potential enemies tomorrow. The Euro-centric bias
in the book, when combined with its tempocentricity, leads to a view of the world that is
a mirror image of the old American society, where the non-Whites found themselves at the
bottom of the social ladder. Such a world order creates a caste system in which the
conflation of race, religion, and culture decides your standing in the scale of social
significance. This point does not register somehow in the mind of Professor Huntington.
Even though he notes the fact that the international system of the European societies of
the medieval and post-medieval period was a mirror image of the pluralism of the feudal
order, he still fails to realize that the structuring of the world according to his
paradigm would create a world order that is a replication of his own society. In a world
where the Western man and woman are outnumbered by the Chinese and the Muslim, or by the
Latin American and the Indian Hindu, it would be dangerous and unwise to deny these forces
the opportunity to realize fully their right as humans to create and to compete for the
recognition of fellow humans. The Eurocentrism of his analysis apparently leads the author
to include &#147;disingenuous&#148; behavior as an important element in the strategic
calculus of the West. That is to say, according to Professor Huntington, the <i>Western
countries should remember that their civilizational interest may sometimes be served not
by adherence to morality but by flirtation with political opportunism. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third significance of this book is its conscious decision to bracket
Judaism and Israel with the West. All other world religions that have played any
meaningful role in human history are identified with a civilization. Why lump Judaism with
Christianity when other forms of Christianity are somehow segregated from the West? How do
you go about separating one form of Christianity from the others? What is it that warrants
the inclusion of Jews in the Western category? These and other related questions are
somehow consciously avoided by the author. One can speculate about why this line of
reasoning is pursued in his book. A thought that comes to mind is the fact that Judiasm
has not created, and did not create in the past, any major civilization that currently
embraces other human groups outside the people who now claim to be descendants of the
ancient Hebrews. Another argument could be that the Jews have somehow transformed
themselves significantly into full fledged Westerners and their destiny is now
inextricably linked to that of the United States and Western Europe. The second point of
speculation on my part might be the correct answer to the unanswered question in Professor
Huntington&#146;s book. No matter how one sees the question, the fact remains that Jews in
the West are today an important group in the Euro-American World. Though their numbers are
small, their current contributions in almost all areas of life in the West are definitely
unprecedented and unbeatable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fourth significance of this book under review lies in the
author&#146;s desperate attempt to fashion out a new coalition of enemies for the
Euro-American World. Having witnessed the collapse and disappearance of the old Communist
empire under Russia, and determined to maintain a high level of military spending in the
Pentagon and elsewhere in the West, men like Professor Huntington are now in search of
enemies. To them, the Green Threat now replaces the Red Menace. Muhammad, Confucius, and
their followers have now replaced Karl Marx and Chairman Mao on the enemy list of
Professor Huntington and his Cold War cohorts. To reify his theory and paradigm, he
advises Western leaders to note his reasons for bracketing these two civilizations as
chief enemies. <i>The followers of Islam constitute a perennial threat because they have a
sense of cultural superiority that now suffers from their sense of humiliation under
Western domination. </i>The Chinese people, on the other hand, are demographically
challenging and their continued economic success poses a threat because economic success
does translate into political and military power. Professor Huntington not only identifies
the sources of conflict between the West and other civilizations, <i>but formulates
strategies that, if successfully followed by the planners in the West, would lead to their
continued dominance. </i>According to the professor, the planners and strategists from the
West should apply the balance of power theory to contain and neutralize the rising powers
such as China in East Asia and India in South Asia. His reading of the literature on East
Asian history leads him to the conclusion that the East Asian peoples have in the past
accepted a hierarchical order dominated by China. He fears a return to this historical
past and that rising China could well be the benefactor of a bandwagon effect. This
bandwagoning strategy has been evident in East Asian history before, and Huntington fears
its return if the East Asian peoples perceive the United States as retreating from a
global role as a primary balancing force to a rising China. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This book deserves some attention from the Muslim World largely because
the author is influential in certain circles in which Western policies are made. Although
his ideas are being challenged globally and within policy-making circles of the West,
there is still need for concerted Muslim efforts to expose the fallacies of the argument
presented in this work.</b> Muslim countries, however, should avoid the problem of
overexposing the Huntington thesis as a self-fulfilling prophecy. Many Muslim and
non-Muslim countries in the Middle East and South East Asia have organized conferences and
seminars to deal with part or all of the ideas contained in this volume. Because of its
provocative nature, and because of the intended and unintended consequences such a
scholarly work could bring to the life of Muslims individually and collectively, it would
be an investment in prudential intellectualism for English-speaking Muslims, especially
those living and working in the West, to counter Professor Huntington&#146;s fallacies.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><i>Erik Paul</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hani was a quilt maker who lived in a small village somewhere in the
Jordan Valley. When young, he spent a great deal of his free time with his best friend
Elias. Together, on warm days, they would go out into the fields and sit and discuss life,
religion and the future. The worst thing about Hani was that he could see no faults in his
friend who remained his ideal until one day some money was stolen from Elias&#146; house.
It was then Elias signed a complaint that he suspected Hani, for as he stated, &#147;He
was the only one who knew where I hid my money.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Try as he would to no avail, Hani denied the accusations and endeavoured
to assert his innocence, but no one believed him, not even his fianc. He was detained in
a local prison during the investigations of the reported theft. No evidence was found
against him, so the police soon released him. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was early evening in spring when Hani walked out of jail free, but
though he had been behind bars, he felt freer when he was imprisoned. Slowly, he trudged
home in the still of the night where the only sound he could hear was the whoop of an owl
and some crickets squeaking in wee voices. He could only think of his friend&#146;s double
betrayal and his fianc breaking off their engagement. Once home, he lit an oil lamp and
sat alone until the small hours of the night, thinking hard about all that had happened. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For days he refused to step outside his house and sweated while sleeping.
He woke up in the middle of the night screaming, &#147;No, I did not steal anything.
I&#146;m innocent.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He suddenly jumped up when he saw the stern countenance of his friend
Elias in his nightmare and then paced back and forth in his cottage asking himself,
&#147;Why me? Why me? I trusted Elias. He was my idol!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He decided the only face-saving thing he could do would be to move to
another village. So he gathered his equipment, which wasn&#146;t much for a quilt maker,
paid his rent and left without telling a soul where he was going or saying good-bye to
anyone. To further his confusion and increase his delusions abut friendship, he was told
that Elias planned to marry his former fianc. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After he settled in a different village, he shunned his faith and fellow
man, and kept much to himself except when someone wanted him to make a new quilt or
refurbish an old one. At times, he felt like visiting his brother who was living in Amman,
but at other moments shutting out the world seemed better. He continued his trade for
several years having as little contact with others as possible. Since there was no one to
spend his money on and he cared little for the extravagances of life, he saved his
earnings and exchanged them for gold. At last, his greatest pleasure became his treasure
and every night after he finished working, he would take out his gold and spend hours
worshipping it. Then he returned it to his leather bag and hid it on his closet shelf. One
day, when he went to the village to buy some more wool for his quilts, a scavenger raided
his home, turning it upside down until at last he found and confiscated the leather bag
and its contents. He stuffed the gold pieces in his pockets, threw the bag on the floor,
and rushed out of Hani&#146;s house and the village forever. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Hani returned home, he discovered his empty leather bag trampled on
the floor covered with dirt. With disbelief, he slowly picked it up, turned it upside down
and shook it even though he knew it was empty. He slumped down on his bed, sunk his head
in his hands and cried, &#147;This is the second time I have been betrayed by other human
beings and now I have lost the only thing that was dear to me!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For two weeks he stopped making quilts and after alerting his neighbour
and the village of the theft, he secluded himself in his home, making it a veritable
prison. Yet, the reaction of the people around him stunned him. They seemed concerned, yet
their sympathy hardly touched his hardened heart. Then one day at the beginning of summer,
a man from Amman knocked on his door. In his arms he carried a small child with golden
curly hair. Hani opened the door and stared at the child who had a dirty face and large
brown eyes, wide and wondering, looking back at him. The man said, &#147;I&#146;m sorry to
bother you, sir, but I&#146;m a friend of your brother. He told me that if anything every
happened to him to deliver his only child to you. A week ago, your brother and his wife
were killed in a car accident. The baby survived and you are the next of kin and the only
one who can take care of the child. I&#146;ve been searching for you for days.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hani didn&#146;t know what to be more shocked about, his brother&#146;s
death or the sudden responsibility of this young life thrust into his arms. The bundle
cuddled next to him. He felt another heart beating beside his own in a warm body. All he
could say to the stranger who brought the baby was, &#147;What is its name?&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;His name is Yahya. Good day, sir, and forgive me for having to
inform you of your brother&#146;s death in this manner.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hani looked down at the small form and exclaimed to it, &#147;I&#146;ve
found some living gold to replace the gold I lost!&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was little Yahya who taught Hani to rediscover the world again and to
have faith once more in his fellow man. He raised the boy as a conscientious adult and
together they prayed and believed in God, for Hani, as a good uncle, could not raise the
boy as an atheist. And the circle of love, once non-existent, grew into a realm of wonder.
Hani gained friends who praised and admired him for dedicating his life to the orphaned
child. The child grew into a man, got married and now lives with his wife and their
children in Uncle Hani&#146;s house. The day Hani&#146;s gold was stolen from him became
the turning point of his life, for he gained unthought-of riches in the golden-haired tot
who found his uncle&#146;s heart and gave him back his trust in human nature. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&nbsp;</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">(A Tribute to Fatima)</i></p>

<p ALIGN="center">Do not go gentle into that good night, </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Old age should burn and rave at close of day; </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Rage, rage against the dying of the light. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Though wise men at their end know dark is right; </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Because their words had forked no lightning they </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Do not go gentle into that good night. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">(Dylan Thomas)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If she could have picked a day for dying in the cold of a desolate, damp,
forsaken winter, she would not have picked a better day. Outside the sky was blue and
clear and soft puffs of creamy clouds inched their way across the lazy winter sky that
hung like a protective canopy over the world that Fatima was finally leaving. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Propped by pillows on her bed beside a window with a view, she drifted off
and on between the here of this world to the there of the unknown. Her attentive, dutiful
daughter, heaven-sent, planted gentle kisses on her mother&#146;s forehead and kept
straightening pillows and covers as a doting parent might arrange the apparel of a
precious infant. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Outside, the sound of a cement mixer reminded the dying Fatima of the
automatic water pump of days of yore in her beloved homeland where droves of orange
groves, lemon trees and honeybees once reigned supreme. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Skateboards rolling down the paved street and children&#146;s laughter in
her host country took her back again to Palestine to the childhood laughter of her own
children running barefoot through the green, green sprinklers of youth and innocence. It
was a time of fresh milk, yogurt, cheese, honey and home-baked bread. A time of long
glorious days lived to the fullest with the sweet sweat of hard work and summer suns
falling like the sound of angels singing and rainbows of promise stretching from one
horizon to another. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Quilted patches of her life now flashed before her as she drifted in and
out of the here and the tangible to the darkness and the unknown quantity awaiting her.
And in one of her flashbacks, she remembered when, in the midst of all the songs, the
dance and land spread out against a paradise sky that she possessed, she one day had
gathered her young children as a hen would gather her chicks and stated in a strong,
determined voice to her husband, &#147;I am leaving and taking the kids with me. There
have been massacres of Palestinian women and children reported in places like Deir Yassin
carried out by Jewish soldiers come to take our land away from us. If you wish to stay and
die on our land, you are free to do so. But we are leaving. I will not watch my children
be butchered in front of me.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She did not bother to look twice into his face for she did not want to
encounter his bewildered, clouded expression. She bundled up some pots and pans, some
blankets, some clothing for her youngsters and piled goods and kids on a wagon and
prepared to drive off to safety. She had told herself that it would only be a few days and
they could all return safely home again. Knowing somehow that her husband would not remain
behind with all that he loved loaded onto the wagon, she locked the door of her cherished
home and placed the keys to her house and barn in the hidden pocket of her thobe. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was the last time she saw her home, her orange groves, the lemon trees,
the birds that sang everywhere, and her beloved village. For some reason, she noted, her
children, not understanding what was going on, were excited about the journey they were
embarking on. No one knew then that they had embarked on a difficult and dangerous
expedition into homelessness, Statelessness and abject poverty. It was an expedition that
would force her older children to work hard in the fields of a neighbouring country just
so all the family could eat one meal. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Fatima&#146;s black coffee eyes were keen and sharp. Long used to
tending the fields, giving childbirth and then returning to work a few hours later, her
strength matched that of most men, and it was this very strength that secured the
well-being of her children. In spite of the hard times, lack of money, loss of wealth and
estate and a once-life in paradise, Fatima raised her sons as men and her daughters as
ladies. She was the envy of all her relatives and no one could outwit her or surpass her
in the battle for survival. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She and her husband, who was once a great hero in his own way, and their
children came to settle East of Gideon in a God-forsaken place where no grass grew, no
trees were found and where no birds sang. In this barren land, the sun was not young and
there were no rainbows that stretched glorious and colourful from one horizon to another.
Yet Fatima and her family survived and made do with very little. There were rations of
flour full of weevils. There were rations of rice filled with worms. The sugar rations
were filled with dirt and the grains were so coarse that one could count them. And all the
donated food and clothing from international charitable organizations never reached the
refugees as free commodities, but were sold for those who could afford to purchase them.
Sometimes a meal consisted of hot tea and bread and nothing else. Still, there was much to
be thankful for. Fatima had grabbed on to that precious gift of life and never let go
until long after she had raised her children and seen them all successful. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She and her family lived in a barren, grey, desolate place as second-class
citizens and were never allowed to forget by the native inhabitants that they were not
equal to the rest of the indigenous population. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So she planted a part of Palestine wherever she could. In tin cans, in
clay pots, between the rocks and in windowsills. And right over her door, jasmine spread
its fragrance to all who entered Fatima&#146;s little kingdom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">She prayed and waited for the day that would take her and her family back
to her homeland. Back to the golden days of summer suns, sweet sweat, back to the time
when her children ran free as the nobility of apple blossoms and mint. Back to her earthly
paradise, on to the fields of praise, where she and her family could reign once more. But
those days never came. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her keys that she kept in a wooden jewellery box began to rust. But every
once in a dreamy while, she would open the box and gently touch them. And on that day she
thought she might die, when day turned to night and wild pigeons were fast asleep and
after all her relatives who came to pay their last respects had departed, she whispered
softly to her daughter, &#147;Please bring me my jewellery box.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her daughter quickly swept across the room, to the treasured corner of a
forgotten closet, and opened a creaking door. She then took the jewellery box and placed
it on her mother&#146;s lap. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;</font>Open it,&#148; the mother demanded in a barely audible voice.
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Her daughter opened the box only to find some rusty old keys lying on
faded silk cushions. Fatima put her hand slowly in the box, picked up the keys, kissed
them and placed them over her heart. Today definitely was not a day to die. Who knew what
the night might bring. Then she slept, clasping the keys in her hand, resting her hand
over her heart. Visions danced through her mind of her former Garden of Eden when she sang
songs of spinning and living carefree, of threshing and lightning flashes and thundering
rain in her kingdom that stretched further than any eye could ever hope to see. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Zaki al-Milad</i></p>

<p ALIGN="center">(2-3)</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">Globalization and Identity: Development or
Meltdown?</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="left">Davidor Rothkopf, professor of international relations at Columbia
University, states: &quot;It is true that globalization has economic roots and political
implications, but it has also shed light on the power of culture in the global
environment. Cultural power both gathers and disperses, at a time when tensions between
wholism and separation arise in every issue and are linked to international relations. The
reality is that the effect of globalization on culture, and the effect of culture on
globalization, deserve attention.&quot;<strong><small>3</small></strong> Globalization has
opened up the issue of identity on a global scale. The discussion of globalization and
culture has revealed both their mutual dependencies and contradictions.<br>
Perhaps Rothkopf's discussion is one of the few instances in the 20th century in which a
large scale discussion is initiated over the issue of identity and what threatens it
through the two alternatives of &quot;annihilation and negation&quot; and &quot;meltdown
and integration.&quot; A third alternative is for culture to be revitalized and expanded.<br>
Before there was great interest in globalization, discussions of identity were greeted
with skepticism and indifference. Concern about identity was presented as a type of
thinking that deserved to be criticized. The opposite is taking place today when there is
widespread serious interest, as well as uncertainty, about globalization. Globalization
entails the imposition of one way of thinking, and the popularization of one type of
culture, through control of the tools of globalization, especially worldwide satellite
delivery of pictures and meanings and symbols and principles, TV programs, computer
software, and the internet. The directors of globalization today are improving the means
and systems of international transmission, and are inventing technologies and new
revolutionary services in the field of communication. They dominate the world market of
ideas and services, which, in turn, affects the way of life, beliefs, languages, and other
components of culture worldwide.<br>
Many have written about the role of technology and information services in this process.
Today 15 large American companies in the area of communications, including giant companies
such as Motorola, Loral Space and Communications, and Teledesic, are pursuing competing
projects. These will allow the individual anywhere in the world to have instant
communication with any other individual no matter where he or she is without needing to
build any basic infrastructure underground near the sender or receiver. Loral has
estimated the cost of such a call at $3.00 per minute.<br>
Technology not only creates change, but creates its own metaphorical world.<strong><small>4</small></strong><br>
Samuel Huntington has criticized those who he believes have called for one world culture,
based on the West, by saying: &quot;Many in the West think that the world is moving
towards one united world culture, essentially Western culture. This thinking is arrogant,
false, and dangerous. The spread of Western consumer items does not mean the spread of
Western culture.&quot;<small><strong>5</strong></small><br>
This clarity in Huntington's ideas, even though he is critical, underlines the fears of
nations and civilizations for their identities, cultures, and civilizational models. The
West will soon discover that it is a reason for the renewal and upliftment of identities
and cultures worldwide, even those cultures and identities that were almost forgotten and
left behind by history and on their way to annihilation. This is due to the West's
provocations, the unraveling of its culture, and its efforts to dominate and control. The
confrontation of the West with these identities has led to their revival and renewed
dynamism, including those cultures displaced by the West, such as some of the original
cultures in Europe, North America, and Australia. These cultures have regained their
strength, and history is being rewritten in North America. The travel diaries of
Christopher Columbus, who was portrayed by the Europeans as a discoverer of the New World,
are giving rise to accusations that he was a pirate and destroyer and that he was not an
explorer but a colonizer engaged in murder and theft. As some modern history books in
Europe are now admitting, the history of North America does not begin with Columbus's
voyage in 1492.<br>
The reality that must be understood by the West is that the non-Arab nations and
civilizations, and some cultures in the West itself, no longer view the West as a dream
and model of progress to be followed. In its own enlightened self-interest the West should
reduce its encroachment on the world, and stop its adventures, and rethink its behavior
patterns that have instigated other nations and civilizations to be anti-West.<br>
It has become evidently clear that identities cannot be removed easily, or through a
crushing blow, and in a final way. The hand of time might stop for some cultures, but it
may move again at any time. Some cultures might be outside of history for a time, and they
might return in another period. History has its cycles and its variations, and God is more
knowledgable of its movements than any human. The Holy Qur'an states: &quot;We rearrange
the days among people.&quot;<small><strong>6</strong></small> Days are apportioned among
people according to patterns and laws that govern life, history, and society. The secret
that gives identities this everlasting quality is the fact that they manifest themselves
at very deep levels inseparable from the nation's soul and general being. Identities bring
together and affect all behavior patterns, the entire system of morals and rights and
responsibilities, the varieties of norms and habits, including the ways of eating, and the
institutions of marriage, contract, language, and religious services. This
interconnectedness and interaction continues for a long time and under a variety of
conditions and circumstances, which causes the identity to be deeply engrained to the
extent that participation in the philosophy and practice of communal life is not
conceivable without it.<br>
Even though it is logical that nations and civilizations should fear for their identities,
it is still impossible for globalization to compartmentalize and de-establish the
identities of nations. There may be major breaches, and the West may take advantage of
deep holes, but it is still very hard to verify the loss and complete meltdown of
identities. How is it possible to explain the continuing presence of native peoples in
North America and Australia, who are living their cultures and identities and their old
moral and social systems at a time when the West, especially the United States, has
achieved the highest forms of progress and modernization?<br>
Huntington argues that when all the nations were exposed to modernization, they may have
become Westernized superficially, but on the most important levels of culture this did not
affect their language, religion, and values. In fact, when nations modernize, they resort
to their cultures and traditional religions to run way from the modern world.&quot;<small><strong>7</strong></small><br>
Globalization is a challenge, a challenge from which identities and cultures may benefit.
Cultures have become more prominent on the world political stage at the level of relations
among nations and civilizations. Perhaps the West was a cause for this increased presence.
This issue received special attention by Labed and Kratoshgel in their book, <i>The Return
of Identity and Culture to International Relations Theory.</i><small><strong>8</strong></small>
They raise the question of the long absence of interest in culture and identity in the
field of International Relations, and they present a framework for rethinking the modern
theoretical extent of the concepts of culture and identity.<br>
In the recent past there have been some seminars and intellectual activities that have
emphasized the problematic nature of the relation between globalization and identity.
These include:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Arab Literature and Globalization</font><br>
</b>Globalization has attracted widespread attention in Arabic literature, economic,
cultural, political, educational, media, and technological. This attention will multiply
in the 21st century as people become more aware of its most glaring aspects and react to
its characteristics and features.<br>
The West is taken up by globalization because it is the founder of globalization and the
moving force behind it, living it as a reality, and organizing its capabilities and
resources and systems on the basis of globalization. Thus the West is aware of the nature
of globalization and its philosophy and its future and its actions, as well as its effect
on its choices and directions and strategies. We in the Arab and Islamic world, on the
other hand, are involved with globalization but we are not an active or effective element
in its movement and direction. We still have not finalized our reading on the nature and
philosophy of globalization. We are enchanted by it rather than acting upon it; we are
affected without being effectors; and we are fearful and wary of it, because we do not
know our place in globalization nor our future.<br>
Whoever looks at Arabic literature will find little understanding and analysis of
globalization, because much writing is designed to demonize it, as if describing a
science-fiction monster coming from a strange world beyond our solar system. Arab writers
do not know how to describe globalization, or identify it, or disentangle its features and
signs. What is said is simply exaggeration and fear-mongering, or assumptions and
metaphoric illustration.<br>
Sadeq Jalal al Azm states that globalization is, &quot;a feature of the capitalistic
transformation of humanity, under the imperialism of the core nations and their leaders,
and under their control, within a global system of unequal exchange.&quot;<small><strong>9</strong></small><br>
Muhammad Abid al-Jabiri states, &quot;Globalization is neo-colonialism, and what is neo in
this term does not mean a clean break from what is prior, but rather a continuation in a
new form.&quot;<small><strong>10</strong></small> Elsewhere he adds, &quot;Globalization
is not simply a tool of capitalistic progress; it is also, in the first degree, an
ideology that reflects the desire to control the world.&quot;<strong><small>11</small></strong><br>
Al-Sayyid Yaseen sees that, &quot;We are still in the stage of understanding the
phenomenon of globalization, and teasing out the hidden laws that govern its progress and
are involved in its formation. It is actually a phenomenon incomplete in its features and
traits; we can actually say that globalization is a continuing project, revealing each day
a new side of its many faces.&quot;<strong><small>12</small></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ali Harb states, &quot;It is dangerous to trivialize and oversimplify our
reading of the phenomenon of globalization. We are facing an event that is complex and
dense, which is opening up without meaning or direction, and is involved in many arenas,
and which unleashes new social forces and alternative cultural forms. The reality is that
whoever follows what is written and said about globalization, whether in the magazines or
intellectual seminars, will find contradictory positions, reflecting </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">differences in reading and analysis.&quot;<strong><small>13</small></strong></p>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 6</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Rise of the Haredim in Israel</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Although expanding steadily from the early 1970s, Jewish religious
fundamentalism in Israel attracted relatively little interest in the dominant secularly
oriented Israeli society until 1988. Members of the various Haredi sects, generally
self-contained in residentially segregated areas of Israeli cities, led lives absorbed by
concerns and preoccupations that appeared exotic at best to outsiders. Although some
members of these sects clashed sharply over specific issues with the secular part of
Israeli society and at those times acquired a bit of public attention, they were mostly
ignored. The sensational Haredi political success in the Israeli parliamentary elections
of 1988, predicted by none of the professional pollsters, surprised many people. Because
of their continued political successes in succeeding elections through the 1990s, the
Haredim put themselves into a position at various times to be able to dictate to the
Israeli secular majority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredi political successes not only caused many Israeli Jews to look
more closely at and to be more concerned with the Haredim but also sparked increased
attention abroad, especially in the United States. The interest generated in the United
States prompted the writing and publication of many new books and articles in English that
focused upon the folkloristic aspects of the Haredim, but unfortunately largely ignored
their basic ideology and world outlook. The following discussion will attempt to analyze,
particularly for those readers who are not literate in Hebrew, the political importance of
the Haredi upsurge. A crucial part of this analysis is the acceptance of the
well-documented proposition that an understanding of the entire Israeli political right is
to some extent dependent upon an understanding of the basic elements of Heredi politics,
apart from the disagreements, splits and reunification efforts of many Heredi individuals
and sects. The two major questions to be analyzed are:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Symbol"></font> How have the Haredi parties secured their
  political influence?</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font FACE="Symbol"></font> What organizational structure have the
  Haredi employed for maximum political success?</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Concern with education has provided the major answer to both questions.
The Haredi have on balance successfully educated their own children and other Jewish
children, over whom they have obtained custody, in a manner guaranteeing maximum
continuity. The Haredi have influenced many Israeli Jews in addition to their own by
acquiring direct authority over several school networks and by indirectly influencing
numbers of other schools.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout the twentieth century, the Haredim have attempted to continue
Jewish education as it had mostly existed in the diaspora before the Enlightenment
influenced Jewish society. The governments in the countries in which the Haredim lived,
however, have at times insisted upon some modernized curricular content that was
inconsistent with and in opposition to what had previously been taught in Jewish schools.
This was the case in Israel until 1980. Since 1980, helped by generous Israeli
governmental subsidies, the Haredim have attempted with some success to reimpose the
earlier type of Jewish education and the earlier school networking system in many poorer
provincial Israeli towns and in slum areas of larger Israeli cities. The Haredi goal has
obviously been to perpetuate their educational influence upon an increasing segment of
younger-generation Israelis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Historically, Jewish schooling began with the heder for Jewish male
children aged three or four. (The heder, a word meaning 'room' in Hebrew, was the name of
the traditional Jewish elementary school as it existed from talmudic times in the earliest
centuries of the Common Era until the formation of the first modern nation-states at which
time many Jews strove to modify or abolish the heder.) The heder was previously for males
only. According to the Talmud and the Halacha, females do not need education and are
explicitly forbidden from some forms of study. Until modern times, most Jewish women
received no formal education and were mostly illiterate. This stood in striking contrast
to Jewish males Faced with governments of modern nation states and with many Jews
themselves reacting against and abolishing the exclusion of females from formal education,
the Haredim established special institutions to train, more precisely to indoctrinate,
young Haredi girls to accept and to agree to inferior education. Heder education consists
only of sacred, Jewish studies. Secular subjects, including arithmetic, foreign languages,
science, literature and Hebrew grammar are excluded. Most of the Bible is included among
subjects not taught. After studying the Pentateuch with the help of a commentary by Rashi
(Rabbi Shlomo Yitzhaki who died in 1099), the students proceed directly to study of the
easier parts of the Talmud. After studying about eight years, the less capable students
are sent to various places to learn a craft, trade or some other occupation; the more
capable are admitted to an institution of higher learning called a yeshiva. (Yeshiva in
Hebrew means sitting or meeting.) Usually, several levels of &quot;yeshivot&quot; (plural)
exist. The weeding-out process of students continues at each level. Those students who are
found to be less capable are directed to moneymaking pursuits and somewhat later to
involvement in religious services as minor rabbis or as supervisors of religious kashrut
rules in restaurants, hospitals, the army and other institutions. The more capable
students proceed in their learning by going from one yeshiva level to another. After
graduating from the highest yeshiva and marrying, the best of the students spend their
lives in an institution called a kollel (a term derived from the word meaning
&quot;entire&quot;) and spend their time studying only talmudic literature. A few of the
most capable are later appointed to high rabbinic positions or become heads of yeshivot or
kollels.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As mentioned previously, traditional Jewish education, described above,
does not include any secular or humanistic studies. It is worth re-emphasizing that this
exclusion of secular subjects includes not only mathematics, all sciences and foreign
languages but also Hebrew literature, which includes poetry dealing with religious
subjects, grammar and Jewish history. It is thus no surprise that Hebrew religious poetry,
even the medieval masterpieces, are unknown to the Haredim. Only the sacred studies (a
pre-modern term in Judaism) are taught with the greatest possible intensity. The sacred
studies consist mostly of the Talmud and some subsequent talmudic literature. At the
highest yeshiva level, one out of twelve to fourteen hours per day of sacred studies may
be devoted to the study of morality, which primarily consists of lurid descriptions of the
punishment, inflicted by God either in the life of this world or in hell, for even the
smallest deviations from religious commandments. The teachings of the biblical prophets,
the books of Job and Ecclesiastes and numerous other parts of the Bible are studied
neither in the heders nor the yeshivot and are therefore unknown to the Haredim. Except
for the Pentateuch, Haredim know only those parts of the Bible quoted in the Talmud and
then only within the context of talmudic interpretation. Haredim generally lack knowledge
of major parts of the Bible; this lack of knowledge constitutes one source of the
differences between the Haredim and some other religious as well as most secular Israeli
Jews. Yeshiva students are often deprived of sleep. After reaching the age of sixteen,
Yeshiva students devote at least twelve to fourteen hours per day to study. The classes
are noisy, because the students shout about what they are studying. Studying in silence is
considered to be a sin. Chaos is often the result in the classroom; different students
often shout about different passages of texts. Students may ask questions about the
internal matters of what is being studied but never about the assumptions upon which
interpretations are made or about the external world. Students are most often isolated
from the outside world, especially from the secular world. Students are prohibited from
contact with unbelievers. The teacher's authority is extensive and almost absolute. The
main teacher or the head of the yeshiva usually will select the wives for students.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The type of education described above has shaped human character. It also
inevitably has produced dissenters. The first Jewish dissenters from Judaism in modern
times rebelled against this type of education and became principled opponents of the
religion that from their perspectives tried to subject them to such totalitarian controls.
Other individuals, schooled in the Haredi tradition, have ultimately yielded to
temptations of modernity, such as watching television and attending movies This usually
has resulted in a weakening of commitment to Haredi Judaism but seldom to its
renunciation. In Israel such persons have been and still are called
&quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;Mesorati.&quot; These people have usually remained -and
still are- outwardly uncritical of what they learned; they have continued to worship the
charismatic rabbis without paying any price for renunciating the prohibition of forbidden
secular pleasures. Others who have strayed but have not undergone self-emancipation have
after a temporary break returned to sacred studies to be again indoctrinated by their
education.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Haredim emphasize the sanctity and predominant importance of the
sacred studies; they believe that the virtue emanating from those engaged in sacred
studies is responsible for all good happenings for Jews. For that reason those who engage
in sacred studies are not required to make their own livings, are granted numerous
privileges and are exempted from communal duties. All of this originated and became
universal among Jews in talmudic times. Living in autonomous communities, in which they
retained local rule, Jews could and did determine that individuals engaged in sacred
studies be exempted from paying taxes and from most other obligations and burdens for
which members of the community were responsible. Additionally, the disciples of the sages,
those who reached a specified high degree of proficiency in the sacred studies, were
granted special privileges in many areas of life over which the Jewish community had
control. During talmudic times (c. AD<b> </b>200-500) in Iraq, for example, the disciples
of the sages, who also were merchants, were granted the privilege of selling their
merchandise before ordinary Jews were allowed to do so in the markets of Jewish towns.
That meant that these disciples of the sages had no competition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A burning issue in Jewish history, and in Israeli politics, is how rabbis
and rabbinical students earn their livelihoods. In Israel the constantly increasing burden
of support weighs heavily upon taxpayers, most of whom are not religious. This has
provoked and continues to provoke resentment, especially when combined with the fact that
a majority of rabbinical students do not have to serve in the army. Most Israeli religious
Jews, especially the Haredim, attempt to justify state support and freedom from army
service by arguing that the Jews and the Jewish state of Israel exist by virtue of their
support of talmudic study. Their support is supposedly responsible in turn for God's
support, which includes God's allowing Israel to win its wars. This argument, similar to
arguments made by clergy of other religions and frequently emphasized in the Israeli
media, alleges that God's help not soldiers win wars. This argument specifies that God
provides other benefits as well. He, for example, grants good weather because of rabbis
and students who spend most of their time studying Talmud. Engaging in such study is the
best way, better than reciting prayers, giving charity or performing other good deeds, to
gain entrance into paradise. Those who engage in talmudic study make it possible for
themselves, their families, their financial supporters and, to some extent, other Jews to
enter paradise.</p>
