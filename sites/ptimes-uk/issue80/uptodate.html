<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (28 February)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> Palestinian sources said Saturday the latest rounds of
talks between high-ranking Israeli and Palestinian officials ended in failure
due to &quot;continued Israeli intransigence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechaei
and the deputy head of PLO executive committee Mahmud Abbas met at the Dehniyya
airport (yet to be opened pending Israel's approval) to discuss outstanding
issues including the overdue Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank,
the opening of the airport and the industrial zone.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The sources described the talks as (a waste of time,&quot;
labeling the Israeli stance as &quot;the same as usual,&quot; adding &quot;there
was no progress whatsoever.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Following the meeting, Abbas admitted the gap between the
two sides' respective positions &quot;was substantial and can't be easily
bridged.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA officials had earlier hoped the breakthrough of the
Iraqi-American crisis would pave the way for more vigorous American involvement
in the peace process.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Israel sources said on Saturday the US administration
was not about to &quot;present ideas of its own to end the present impasse
in the peace process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA officials acknowledged &quot;Israeli equivocation and
American connivance with Netanyahu.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hanan Ashrawi, who holds the higher education portfolio
in the PA government conceded in a newspaper interview Saturday that the
Palestinians were deceived by the Israelis and the Americans alike.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;At the culmination of the Iraqi crisis, the Israeli
government began efforts to activate talks with us,&quot; said Ashrawi,
adding, however, that &quot;as long as the Iraqi crisis began to recede,
the Israeli leadership reverted to its characteristic intransigence.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, a Palestinian Legislative Council Member accused
PA Chairman Yasser Arafat of &quot;not doing what should be done in the
face of Israeli deception.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They (the Israeli government) is beguiling the weak
Palestinian leadership through holding recurrent rounds of insincere talks
aimed at gaining time and exhausting the Palestinians,&quot; said Abu Omar
in an interview with the Arabic daily, al Quds, on Saturday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Netanyahu will stall and stall and stall knowing
that Arafat has no alternative but to wait and wait and wait because the
United States is the only country that can exert real pressure on Israel
and the Americans are not about to do that neither now nor in the foreseeable
future,&quot; said Abu Omar.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel unhappy about agreement</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem -PT(23 February)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli officials reacted with a combination of consternation
and ambivalence to the agreement reached in Baghdad on Monday between U.N.
Secretary-General Kufi Annan and the Iraqi leadership.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu told reporters
that Saddam Hussein gave in to American demands, adding that there was no
reason why the United States shouldn't go ahead with plans to attack Iraq
if it emerged that the Iraqi leader didn't fully succumb to American conditions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Netanyahu, who came under sever criticisms from the leftist
opposition for showing poor brinkmanship, said the Israeli position throughout
the crisis was right.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that &quot;our enemies knew our force of deterrence
before and after the crisis.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, Netanyahu critics described his words as &quot;verbal
juggling.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yossi Sarid, leader of the leftist party <I>Merets </I>described
Netanyahu as a big impostor who shams statesmanship.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sarid accused Netanyahu of creating false hysteria in the
Israeli society, arguing that Israel was the main loser in the Iraqi crisis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Government ministers didn't hesitate to express outright
dismay at the agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Health Minister Joshoua Matsa said he was not happy nor
sad at the agreement, adding that a new crisis would unfold sooner or later.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He urged the United States to keep its armada of warships
and aircraft carriers in the Gulf on a permanent basis.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The same call was also made by Avigedor Kahlani, Minister
of Internal Security, who expressed ambivalence with the Baghdad agreement.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Kahlani told the Israeli radio &quot;<I>voice of Israel&quot;
</I>that Saddam Hussein would continue to pose a threat to Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He also alluded to Iran as &quot;an important threat to
Israel and American interests in the region.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>For their part, the Palestinian Authority (PA) welcomed
the agreement as &quot;good news from Baghdad.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>PA chairman Yasser Arafat told journalists in Gaza he hoped
the world would now pay more attention to the stalled peace process. <BR>

against Iraq</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (22 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sporadic protests against a probable American aggression
on the Iraqi people continued to take place throughout the West Bank, Gaza
and the pre-1967 Palestinian territories.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>So far, demonstrations took place in Dura, Bani Naim, Hebron,
Beit Ommar, Bethlehem, Dheishe, Ramallah, as well as many localities across
the green line (Israel).</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Ramallah on Saturday, thousands of Palestinian youth
hurled stones at Israeli soldiers manning military positions near the town's
southern entrance. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Earlier, demonstrators burned Israeli and American flags
despite police orders not to do so. Moreover, protesters shouted slogans
against Palestinian Authority (PA) police chief Ghazi al Jabali, who had
threatened to &quot;break the necks of protesters.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;<I>Ya Jabali Ya Amil&quot; &quot;</I>Jabali (Israeli)
collaborators&quot; shouted hundreds of demonstrators at the al Manara Square
in downtown Ramallah.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Nearby at Beir Zeit University, students marched through
the university town, shouting anti-American slogans and carrying placards
denouncing &quot;cowboys' cannibalistic instincts.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the meanwhile, Fatah, which has organized many of the
protests since the onset of the American-Iraqi crisis, circulated a leaflet,
saying the American aggression on Iraq would be an aggression on all Arabs
and Muslims.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the leaflet castigated American double standards
in dealing with both Iraq and Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In Bethlehem, over a thousand protesters marched through
the town, shouting anti-American and anti-Israel slogans.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One placard read &quot;Uncle Sam! how much more Iraqi blood
would satiate your cannibalistic appetite.?&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish settlers Commemorate mass murderer</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (17 February)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hundreds of Jewish settlers in Hebron and the nearby settlement
of Kiryat Arba have begun a &quot;weak of commemoration&quot; in memory
of Baruch Goldstein, the Jewish mass murderer who on 25 February, 1994,
machine-gunned 29 Arab worshipers at al Khalil's Ibrahimi Mosque before
he himself was overpowered and subsequently killed by survivors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the last few days, scores of settlers, including children,
laid wreaths at Goldstein's tomb which has become a pilgrimage site for
many Israeli and Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Sources close to settlers said thousands of &quot;the lovers
of the land of Israel and of the Tora of Israel&quot; were expected to arrive
at Kiryat Arba &quot;to pay homage&quot; to Goldstein.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Baruch Marzel, a prominent Kach (an outlawed terrorist
movement in Israel and the United States) member and a fervent disciple
of Goldstein, said in a radio interview that the number of Goldstein followers
among the settler population and the larger Jewish community was rising.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Many more Jews are subscribing to the ideas and ideals
of Goldstein,&quot; Marzel said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that contrary to the negative image Goldstein
received in the media, his image among &quot;real Jews&quot; was that of
&quot; a national hero and a great lover of the land of Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Concordant Israeli and Palestinian sources stress that
while Goldstein is gone, &quot;Goldsteinism&quot; is well and alive among
many Israelis, a vindication of Marzel's remarks.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Recently, a young bearded settler appeared on TV explaining
to a foreign journalist &quot;the glorious merits of what Goldstein did.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The young settler told the foreign journalist that &quot;if
what Joshua did to the Philistines and the Cannanites three thousand years
ago was right, why shouldn't what Goldstein did four years ago right likewise?&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Baffled by the settler's hideous analogy, the journalist
asked the settler &quot;does this mean you support murdering innocent Arabs?&quot;
To this the settler retorted, &quot;You are dead right.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Many pundits have repeatedly pointed out that Goldstein's
&quot;genocidal ideas&quot; were in no way confined to a small segment of
Israeli Jewish population as is often projected by Israeli media and officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The pundits site many opinion surveys showing disproportionately
high numbers of Israelis calling for the expulsion of Palestinians from
&quot;the land of Israel&quot; and maintaining the status quo of Arabs in
Israel as &quot; second class minority.&quot;</FONT></P>

death</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (17 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinians in Jordan and the West Bank have been deeply
saddened by the sudden death of Munif Hijjeh, a prominent businessman and
philanthropist who was particularly known of his generous support for charitable
institutions especially in the Hebron area.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hijjeh died in Istanbul at 44, of a massive cardiac arrest,
while on a business trip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, Hijjeh's body was laid to rest in Dura, his
home town, 10 miles south west of Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>As many as ten thousand people took part in the solemn
procession, including religious figures, civic leaders and PA officials.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Before burial, Hijjeh was eulogized by Sheikh Nayef Rajoub,
Imam of the Grand Mosque in Dura, who described the deceased as &quot;a
glorious example of how a Muslim businessman ought to be.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub, an eloquent speaker, said Hijjeh helped the needy,
fed the hungry, and comforted the inflicted, adding that he was immensely
loved by those who knew him.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He prayed that &quot;he will be loved by God as he was
by man.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hijjeh, a religious man, supported orphanages, schools
as well as many poor families in the West Bank and in Jordan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He also contributed generously in the construction of many
mosques and Islamic centers, and paid the tuition on behalf of scores of
poor college students in Hebron and Amman.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hijjeh was also a fervent supporter of the recently-outlawed
Islamist <I>Refah </I>Welfare party in Turkey headed by Necmeddin Erbakan.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hijjeh is survived by his wife, two sons and three daughters
as well as his mother and five sisters.<BR>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinian Islamists condemn US &quot;arrogance
of power&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (16 February)</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian Islamists have urged Arab heads of state to
hasten to save the Iraqi people from &quot;the imminent American aggression,&quot;
a leaflet signed by the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) said on Monday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet pointed out that the United States was &quot;going
too far in its insolence and arrogance of power by preparing to strike at
the Iraqi people who have been debilitated by seven years of oppressive
sanctions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet went on: &quot;with the cowboy mentality, America
is launching a blind and evil crusade to protect its strategic interests...without
ethics, save the ethics of naked military force, and without principles
and humanitarian considerations.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The leaflet exposed the &quot;stark double standards&quot;
adopted by the American administration vis-a-vis Iraq and &quot;Israeli-Zionist
brutal oppression and torment of the Palestinian people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the leaflet expressed appreciation for the Saudi
Arabian refusal to allow American war planes to use Saudi soil as &quot;a
launching pad&quot; for aggression against Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Friday, Islamist speakers in mosques throughout the
occupied territories called on the Muslim Umma to resist American hegemony,
saying the US was not only after Iraq but after any and every country that
refuses to budge to American imperialism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Never the less, one speaker, Sheikh Nayef Rajoub of the
Grand Mosque in Dura, opined that the &quot;fault lies not in the United
States but in the Muslim Umma itself.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The fault is not with America which seeks to subjugate
and humiliate us, but in our Umma and its leaders who readily accept American
hegemony.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Rajoub said it was a foregone conclusion that Saddam Hussein
is a brutal and ruthless despot, adding, however, that the United States
was not after Saddam, whom he said, was serving American interests in the
region, but was rather after &quot;Iraq's recovery potentials.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Friday imam at al Masjidul Aksa essentially repeated
the same theme, urging Muslim leaders &quot;to awaken from their deadly
silence and cowardly posture.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;When Saddam Hussein struck Teheran with long-range
rockets, the US and the West in general actually helped him, but when the
prospect of his missiles reaching the &quot;state of oppression&quot; (Israel),
the world wasted no moment in attacking and destroying him.&quot; the imam
said during the Juma'a sermon on Friday. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 12 February, Hamas military wing, the Izzidin al Kassam
Squads, warned that any American attack on Iraqi civilians would not pass
unanswered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Let the world know that we at al Kassam Brigades
would not stand idle in case the brotherly Iraqi people were attacked...our
response would be human bombs in the depths of the Zionist entity.&quot;

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Jewish settlers warn government against removing
terrorist's tomb</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (10 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jewish extremists warned the Israeli government on Tuesday
against removing the tomb of Baruch Goldstein from Kiryat Arba'a, threatening
to &quot;turn the world upside down in case the tomb was tinkered with.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Goldstein is the Jewish terrorist who in February 25, 1994
massacred 29 Palestinian worshipers at the Ibrahimi Mosque in Hebron before
he was himself killed by survivors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ever since his death on the day of the massacre, Godstein's
tomb has become a pilgrimage site for Jews from places as far as California.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Baruch Marzel, a friend of Goldstein, said in a radio interview
Tuesday that he along with his friends would &quot;turn the world upside
down&quot; in case the remains of Goldstein were removed from Kiryat Arba'a.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Marzel, a leading member of the terrorist Jewish movement
&quot;Kach,&quot; added that any tinkering with &quot;the sacred tomb of
the saint Baruch Goldstein&quot; would spark off unpredictable reactions
from many Jews.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Marzel's vitriolic threats came in reaction to a Knesset
proposal tabled by the Israeli parliamentarian Dudy Tsuker calling for the
removal of a memorial plaque atop Godstein's tomb and transferring his remains
to Tel Aviv or Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the notion calls for the incrimination of activities
and actions proscribing sanctity to terrorists and their places of burial.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Tsuker's notion was labeled as &quot;evil and repulsive&quot;
by Kiryat Arba'a settlers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Settlement chief rabbi, Dov Leor, described Tsuker's
proposal as &quot;inimical to Jewish traditions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Leor is considered among the leading advocates of &quot;Goldsteinism&quot;
the Jewish equivalent of Nazism.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last year, he published a book glorifying and lionizing
the terrorist Goldstein. He described him as &quot; a great saint&quot;
whose action would herald the age of redemption for the Jewish people.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Leor teaches his many disciples that the blood
of Jews is redder than that of non-Jews, suggesting that Jews are preferred
by God than non-Jews.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israeli government Okays &quot;torture law&quot;</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (8 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli cabinet has officially endorsed a draft law
allowing the employment of physical and psychological torture by Israeli
intelligence interrogators against Palestinian detainees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The draft law, entitled &quot;the General Security Service
Law&quot; stipulates that GSS interrogators may use &quot;moderate physical
pressure against detainees whenever deemed necessary for safeguarding the
security of the state.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The new draft law doesn't stipulate what constitutes &quot;moderate
physical pressure&quot; nor details the ways and means to be employed by
Israeli interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>This means the matter will be left for the individual interrogator
or his immediate superior to determine if the case at hand warrants or not
the use of torture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The canonization of torture by the Israeli government has
drawn sharp reactions from anti-torture groups in Palestine.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;This law is a stigma at Israel's forehead,&quot;
said the Director of the &quot;People Against Cruelty,&quot; an inter-confessional
organization against torture, in a radio interview on Sunday.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to human rights organization, the new torture
law would effectively absolve interrogators indulging in torture from any
legal responsibility even if the torture caused death.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The GSS currently uses a variety of officially-sanctioned
means of torture including the notorious &quot;shaking technique,&quot;
which often causes brain dislocation and hemorrhage, severe beating, strangulation,
electric shocks and hooding.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, numerous forms of psychological torture are used
against Palestinians which experts say are often similar to the forms of
torture used by the Nazis in the 1940s.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the last two years, as many as 12 Palestinian detainees
died of torture at the hands of Israeli interrogators.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>While Israel is not the only country in the world that
practices torture, it is the indeed the only country that officially sanctions
the savage practice.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli officials routinely seek to justify the use of
torture as the only available means to extract confessions from Palestinian
detainees.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, human rights organizations, Palestinian and Israeli
alike, argue that political detainees are also subjected to various forms
of torture.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, a public opinion survey conducted in Israel
showed that over half the Israeli Jewish population supported the employment
of a variety of physical and psychological torture against non-Jews.</FONT>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>HR groups urge PA to investigate death </FONT></H3>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>at police center; authority of law nonexistent</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (7 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian human rights groups have accused Palestinian
Authority police of &quot;seeking to conceal evidence&quot; concerning the
death last week of a Palestinian detainee at a PA police lockup in Dura,
8 miles south West of Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Palestinian Human Rights Monitoring Group (PHRMG) charged
in a press release on Friday that the PA was &quot;dragging its feet in
clarifying the exact circumstances surrounding the death of Nasser al Hurub.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Hurub, 28 and father of five children, died in vague
but suspicious circumstances on Monday 2 February only two hours after his
arrest at the hands of PA policemen in Dura.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>His family has insisted all along that his death resulted
from torture at the hands of PA police, a charge denied by the police officials
who claimed al Hurub committed suicide.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Two autopsies performed on al Hurub's body showed the death
resulted from a massive rupture of a major artery in the brain. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, it remains to be established what caused the hemorrhage.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The case is likely to remain shrouded in vagueness especially
in the light of the fact that the PA lacks proper forensic facilities.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PHRMG pointed out that shortly after his arrest, al
Hurub started bleeding from the mouth and the ears.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Hebron police Chief Tareq Zeid told (<I>PT</I>) al Hurub
strangled himself to death using a shoe string.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, his wife stressed that her husband was wearing
unlaced at the time of his arrest.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Al Hurub is the 19th Palestinian to dies in PA custody
since the installment of Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority more than
three years ago.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The latest prison fatality in the PA autonomous enclaves,
say observers, is only an outer symptom of the dire state of the Palestinian
judicial system.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Saturday, Professor Ali al Jarabawi of the Beir Zit
University, declared that &quot;the rule of law within the Palestinian Authority
is nonexistent.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Jarbawi, a professor of political science, wrote in the
Ramallh-based Arabic daily <I>al Ayyam </I>that &quot;there was a state
of chaos in our legal system and one no longer knows who is responsible
for what .&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Citing an example of the rampant judicial disarray within
the autonomous enclaves, Jarbawi pointed out that the acting Palestinian
minister of Justice, Freih Abu Maddin, dismissed the head of the PA Supreme
Court, Qusay al Abadleh, while the latter was on an official visit in Cairo.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last month, the PA dismissed a Ramallah judge after he
ruled that a score of Beir Zit University students ought to be released
as their continued detention by PA police was illegal.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat losing faith in U.S. role in Peace
Process</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (4 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a sign of growing Palestinian impatience and disenchantment
with the American role in the Middle East peace process, Palestinian Authority
Chairman Yasser Arafat began on Wednesday a new European tour aimed at mobilizing
European pressure on Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said Arafat would hold talks with the
leaders of the Netherlands and Spain and try to convince them to pressure
Israel for implementing the stipulated Israeli army redeployment in the
West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, Arafat met with the leaders of France and the
United Kingdom and reportedly obtained a promise that Europe would step
up its peace efforts.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Wednesday, a close aide to Arafat said the Palestinian
leader &quot;was losing the remaining confidence in the credibility of the
American role in the peace process.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Abdul Rahman, Secretary of the PA cabinet, said Arafat
became hopeless of any genuine American pressure on Israel especially after
the failure of the two White House meetings between U.S. President Bill
Clinton and both Arafat and Netanyahu.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Rahman said the recent visit by U.S. Secretary of
State Madeleine Albright to Palestine served to enforce the feeling of &quot;helplessness
on the part of the Palestinian leadership,&quot; citing Albright's soft
tone with Netanyahu in contrast with her sharp tone on Iraq.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Paradoxically, Arafat reportedly had thought Albright would
be seeking to strike some balance in the American policy in the Middle East
by showing that the U.S. was serious in trying to achieve peace between
Israel and the Palestinians as much as it was determined to &quot;force
Iraq to comply with U.N. resolutions.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, having lacked the inclination and the will to
pressure Netanyahu to carry out the long overdue redeployment, Albright
sent a depressive message to Arafat, saying &quot;don't expect America to
pressure Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Indeed, the bleak message must have prompted Arafat's spokesman,
Nabil Abu Rudeineh, to declare the next two weeks to be &quot;decisive.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, Arafat's aides have already begun to label
the American role in the peace process as &quot;conspiratorial.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian exasperation with perceived American connivance
with Israel coincided with the Israeli decision on Wednesday to build a
new Jewish neighborhood at Ras al Amud in East Jerusalem.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli decision draw strong reactions from Palestinian
leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Faisal Husseini, who holds the Jerusalem portfolio in the
PA administration, called the decision &quot;a powder kerg&quot; and warned
Israel against putting it into effect.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Ahmed Abdul Rahman said the Israeli decision would deal
a the death blow to the already moribund peace process. </FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Israel admits Hamas didn't plan bomb attacks</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-PT (2 February) </FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli authorities have admitted that earlier Israeli
reports alleging the arrest of two Hamas fighters on their way to carry
out a bomb attack in Israel were &quot;inaccurate&quot; and &quot;lacking
credibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On Monday, the Israeli Hebrew press reported that General
Security Service (GSS) officials criticized Internal Security Minister Avigdor
Kahlani for &quot;blowing up the issue out of proportion by channeling false
information to the international media.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to the Hebrew daily <I>Yedeot Ahranot</I>, GSS
officials rebuked Kahlani for &quot;contributing to weakening GSS credibility.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yedeot also reported one GSS official as saying that &quot;this
issue ought to teach Kahlani a lesson in how to keep his mouth shut.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Last week, news agencies and leading television networks
quoted Israeli officials as saying that &quot;two would-be Hamas suicidal
bombers were arrested while on their way to carry out a suicide bomb-attack
inside Israel.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli radio, often a mouthpiece of the GSS, even
pointed out that large amounts of TNT were found in the two suspects' cars.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu and
other Israeli officials used the report to justify Israeli refusal to implement
the long overdue Israeli army redeployment in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 30 January, the people of the Bedouin village of Ksefeh
in the Negev demonstrated against Kahlani, calling on him to resign and
apologize for &quot;the libelous and malicious accusations he made against
the people of our village.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Knesset member Talab al Sanei, a Bedouin, said Kahalani
should have known what he was talking about.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;He should have waited to know the truth before rushing
to tell Reuters that two Hamas bombers had been detained.&quot; he said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In a similar incident, Israeli police yesterday released
three Palestinian university students who had been arrested two weeks earlier
for &quot;aiding Hamas.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Police sources said the charges were false.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The students, Fuaz Abu Ghosh and Yazid Yaghmour, both of
Beit Hanina neighborhood near Jerusalem, were reportedly placed in solitary
confinement for two weeks. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The two also told relatives their hands were tied and they
were forced to sit on low stools with their hands and legs fettered.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In other development, Israeli troops arrested on Sunday
six Najah University students while on their way to school.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Israeli occupation troops routinely erect roadblocks and
checkpoints on all roads and routs from and to Palestinian towns under Yasser
Arafat's PA administration.<BR>
