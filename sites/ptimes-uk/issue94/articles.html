<h3 align="center"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000"><b>University elections put Hamas among the
avant-garde</b></font></font mstheme></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khaled Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Contrary to many expectations and despite the combined Israeli-PA
clamp-down, Hamas succeeded remarkably in defeating Fatah, the backbone of Yasser
Arafat&#146;s Palestinian Authority (PA), in the college elections which took place at the
campuses of three major Palestinian universities&#151;Bir Zeit, the Islamic University of
Gaza and the Hebron University in Hebron&#151;on 23 and 24 of March.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the Hebron University elections on 23 March, Hamas and its junior
sister the Islamic Jihad defeated a broad coalition consisting of Fatah and other PLO
factions, including the PFLP, DFLP and the People&#146;s Party.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas and the Islamic Jihad received 20 and 2 seats respectively, while
Fatah and the left obtained 19 seats out of the 41 contested seats of the Student Council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The results were significant in many respects. The PA and its security
apparatus worked very hard, using the stick and carrot method, to intimidate
Islamic-oriented students and dissuade undecided students from voting for Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This scandalous interference in a university election by an authority
claiming to represent all Palestinians took many brazen forms, including offering
financial bribes, putting up a show of force at the Hebron University campus on the
election day itself, and arresting a number of key Islamic student activists prior to the
election in order to undermine the chances of Hamas winning.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to neutral sources in Hebron, the PA paid the Fatah Bloc $51,000
to buy off voters. It is not clear where the money went, but there are already rumours
that the money ended up in a few Fatah activists&#146; pockets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the Shabiba used dirty tricks to scare students off the
Islamic Bloc by disseminating false information to the effect that &#147;those students
voting for Hamas will not be given jobs after graduation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to Abdul Khaleq al Natshe, an Islamist leader in Hebron, the
Islamic Bloc was not facing another similar student group, but rather a &#147;State with
enormous means.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We are not merely competing against a group of students with a
different platform; we are facing the entire PA apparatus which is using all means under
their disposal to beat us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the Islamic University of Gaza, Hamas received 75% of the
students&#146; votes, the Islamic Jihad 5% and Fatah 19%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The results sent a clear message to Arafat and his police and intelligence
chiefs in Gaza, who never missed an opportunity to undermine the University.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, in 1996, Gaza Police Chief Ghazi Jabali ordered his men to raid
the buildings of the University, smashing scientific instruments in the chemistry labs,
worth hundreds of thousands of dollars.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fatah loses traditional stronghold</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the biggest disappointment for Fatah and the PA was what happened at
Bir Zeit University, a traditional stronghold for the secular nationalist Palestinian
movement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas emerged the premier winner, again in the face of overwhelming
interference by the PA security establishment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to election results, Hamas won 23 seats, whereas Fatah won only
19, with the remaining 9 seats going to the leftist coalition.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This means that Hamas has won two additional seats compared to last
year&#146;s election, a noted achievement at a university that avowedly claims to be the
main bastion of secularism in Palestine.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Future elections on hold</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The election results are expected to sound an alarm bell in Fatah and the
PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There was talk last month of possible local and municipal elections to
take place this coming summer in the self-rule areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, in light of Arafat&#146;s plummeting popularity as expressly
demonstrated at the educational institutes, it is very unlikely that Arafat will allow a
bigger and more representative election to be held &#147;under present
circumstances.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, &#147;inadequate circumstances&#148; were the reason why he froze
the local elections, which were supposed to take place two years ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As to when conducive circumstances will come about, nobody knows for sure,
but they don&#146;t seem to be near, at least in light of the results of the university
elections. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Arafat&#146;s Aerial Manoeuvres</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Dr. Azzam Tamimi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps Yasser Arafat deserves to be in the Guinness Book of Records: not
for his 180-degree turn from &#145;terrorist&#146; to &#145;peace-maker&#146;&#151;to use
American and Israeli terminology&#151;nor for having survived so miraculously against all
odds and outlived all his old comrades who were almost all liquidated along the zigzag
road to Palestine. Rather, it is for spending most of his time in the past few months
flying in the air that he qualifies to be a record-breaker. <!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(60,200) (114,228) {Arafat} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ffff00 CT 0  " src="arafat.gif" alt="arafat.jpg (25753 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" width="172" height="229" u-originalsrc="arafat.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_arafat.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Using simple arithmetic, one finds no difficulty coming to the conclusion
that &#145;Mr. Chairman&#146; hardly spends any time in Gaza, his capital city. One
wonders whether it is his extremely busy schedule of essential tasks that keeps him off
the ground or the desire to stay away from an increasingly unbearable environment&#151;one
of his own making&#151;that keeps reminding him of his failings. In the morning he is in
Riyadh visiting ailing King Fahd; at lunch-time he is in Cairo explaining himself and
reporting to Egypt&#146;s Mubarak; and in the evening he dines in Paris. The next morning
he is in Gaza inspecting a guard of honour only to inspect it once more, prior to
departing, hours later on another tour that may take him to the Gulf, or to Europe and
eventually to his newly acquired friends in Washington. No businessman may ever
contemplate competing with Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But what is it he seeks to sell? It is the Palestinian State. In the midst
of utter desperation and profound frustration, the Palestinian State seems to be the
lifeboat that may carry Arafat and his doomed Palestinian Authority to safety. Especially
if recognized and encouraged by his Arab and European friends, the State, Arafat believes,
may provide an exit, or deliverance, out of the predicament of Oslo&#146;s legacy. On the
other hand, he seems to think that playing his last card&#151;the declaration of
Statehood&#151;especially when in the company of foreign dignitaries, may change his
fortunes, or at least improve his chances of snatching something&#151;anything&#151;from
his current Israeli &#145;peace partners&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Had it not been for pure electoral calculations, the Israeli government
would have welcomed Arafat&#146;s plan. Evidently, the Israeli Labour Party finds the
&#145;Palestinian State&#146; manoeuvre plausible. After all, the emergent Palestinian
entity would have acquired nothing more than what it already has: a &#145;President&#146;,
a &#145;flag&#146;, a &#145;national anthem&#146;, a &#145;police force&#146;, an
efficient &#145;prison service&#146;, a powerless &#145;parliament&#146; and a &#145;local
government&#146; in charge of administering the domestic affairs of the public. Such an
entity, even if called a &#145;State&#146;, would have no sovereignty, would continue to
be dependent in terms of economy and security on Israel and would have no control over its
borders. In fact, a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian State could be the golden
opportunity the Israelis have been waiting for. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With most of the 1967-occupied territory still under full Israeli control,
the status quo created by such a declaration would enable Israel to formally annex what it
controls. What remain afterwards, and especially so in the West Bank, will be separate and
distant islets of Palestinian-controlled patches of heavily populated land surrounded by
Jewish settlements, Israeli army barracks and highway bypasses for the exclusive use of
Israel&#146;s own &#145;public&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The reason why the Likud Party is adamant on rejecting this seemingly
favourable step is purely technical. After all, this is a party that was brought to power
by the votes of the extreme right, which would not swallow the idea of a Palestinian State
even if it had zero sovereignty. Likud&#146;s main priority now is to be re-elected and
therefore it cannot be seen as leaning in any way toward Arafat&#146;s State, even if it
were more beneficial for the Israelis than for the Palestinians. Indeed, the time may come
when the Likud may change its position. This will happen when the idea of a
sovereignty-less Palestinian State becomes less detestable to right-wing Jewish voters,
just as is the case now with the Labour Party and its left-wing supporters.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The disastrous repercussions of a unilateral declaration of a Palestinian
State have become so obvious, especially to former secular PLO supporters inside and
outside Palestine, that an alternative solution has been proposed. Realizing that a
Palestinian State under the present circumstances is no State at all, intellectuals such
as Dr. Azmi Bishara, Dr. Edward Said and Dr. Ghada El-Karmi have advocated a bi-national
State solution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The bitterness of Arafat&#146;s plan has prompted such intellectuals to
promote what they deem to be a less bitter, less evil, solution. However, for most
Palestinians, inside as well as outside, neither proposal is acceptable, most obviously
for failing to guarantee the Palestinians&#146; right to return to their homes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When he returns from his Washington trip (started on 23 March), Arafat may
cease to mention the State for a while. His &#145;dear friend&#146; Bill Clinton will have
advised him to &#145;keep his mouth shut&#146; until the Israeli elections are over.
Clinton is in a position to succeed in what others have failed, namely to persuade Arafat
that it will do him no good to keep hoisting the State&#146;s card in the face of Israel
at this extremely crucial time. In the meantime, life in Palestine will proceed as usual;
more Palestinian homes will be demolished every day; and more land will be confiscated to
allow for the expansion of existing settlements, the building of new ones or the
construction of additional highway bypasses. The Palestinians will continue to be
imprisoned in their own towns and villages under the guard of both Israeli troops and
Palestinian police. Palestinian prisoners will continue to languish in Israeli jails.
Economic difficulties will continue to make life increasingly unbearable for hundreds of
thousands of Palestinians. Various Palestinian security bodies will compete in proving to
their &#145;colleagues&#146; in the CIA and the Israeli intelligence services that they
are trustworthy and reliable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And Yasser Arafat will continue to inspect the guards of honour either
upon arrival from a tour or in preparation for departure to embark on a new one.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">The Process of Peace and War</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ramzy Baroud</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Arab and Muslim worlds are listed in American foreign policy as a
part of a &#147;process&#148;. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &#147;process&#148; in American politics was effectively used
by its inventor Henry Kissinger during his adventures in &#147;shuttle diplomacy&#148; to
resolve the Egyptian-Israeli conflict in the mid-1970s.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The use of this term has been widely associated with the word
&#147;peace&#148;. Most of us, regardless of our stand on many of the political issues in
the Middle East, repeat the term &#147;peace process&#148; with confidence. Since the
establishment of civil societies, people are accustomed to resolving disputes or at least
identifying them with simple yet precise definitions. So it has been said, Peace vs. War,
Right vs. Wrong, and Victim vs. Aggressor. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The &#147;peace process&#148;, however, came as a saving device and an
excuse for those who refuse to accept the moral implications of their actions. Because
within the &#147;peace process&#148; there is no guilty or innocent, there is no victim or
victimizer. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The process of peace simply denies all of that and resorts only to
dividing the disputes into categories, starting with the trivial issues. In the case of
the Israeli-Palestinian talks, Gaza-Jericho was agreed upon as a start, and all the real
issues were left till the end of the process.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The moral dilemma here is: how can you engage two parties in peace
talks while one holds all the cards and the other is denied holding even an identity card?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The concept of the &#147;peace process&#148; is an American invention
created to get around the direct and clear resolutions of the United Nations without
appearing as an imperialistic monster.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Once a weak nation gets involved in the so-called &#147;process&#148;,
the process will be the only hope that it has to achieve anything, perhaps even mere
survival.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Take the case of Israel and the Palestinians again. Israel could at any
point reject any further involvement in this process. In fact, Israel did and will always
threaten its withdrawal. For the Palestinians, it is not as easy an option as it sounds.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the case of a poor and weak nation like that of the Palestinians,
history is hard to reverse. No one will expect Arafat to take his men and women and search
for a new front in Syria, Lebanon or the Moon Islands, perhaps to go back to the old
&#147;hit and run&#148; strategy to fight the Israeli Occupation.<br>
Who&#146;s responsible for the abuse of weak nations? It&#146;s &#147;The Process&#148;,
of course.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In the old days, Palestinians had very specific demands: the
implementation of UN resolution such and such&#133;end of story.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Nowadays, however, even Palestinians don&#146;t know what their legal
rights are. Some argue Oslo I, while others carry on about Oslo II, the Cairo accords, the
Washington accords, Wye River, etc&#133;<br>
And with each argument presented, Israel has a hundred counter-arguments to oppose it.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reality has changed for Palestinians without any serious gains. All of
a sudden, the victimized Palestinians found themselves partners in a dispute where no one
was held accountable, thanks to Kissinger and his &#147;process&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The term &#147;process&#148;, which now has become a concept, is
associated with other words besides peace. The &#147;peace process&#148; was declared
because it has a positive sound, even though it carries a hidden agenda that cannot be
felt until later on in the &#147;process&#148;, which may be too late. &#147;War&#148; is
also a process. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The United States found itself unable to escape a serious war and, at
the same time, found it impossible to handle and protect its interests in a civil manner.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a middle ground, it chose to use the &#147;middle war&#148; or
&#147;the war process&#148; to achieve its goals. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Americans don&#146;t behave as if their army is engaging in a bloody
war with Iraq, and that is the whole idea.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Through that process, the U.S. government can achieve its goals without
being pressured and without being held accountable to its own people, as in the case of
Vietnam. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At the same time, the sanctions and the continuous bombing in Iraq is
enough to protect U.S. interests in the Middle East, including the security of Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As attractive as it may sound, neither the process of peace nor war is
going to have long-lasting effects. The two techniques are based on tricking certain
groups into believing in things that are not true.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Such a trick can only go so far, but not far enough because nations,
even poor ones, have a given capacity to tolerate injustice.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One day, however, once they find that the process is not taking them
anywhere, and even if they have no cards left to play, they could tip the whole table over
onto the heads of the players. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the poor, it will not be a loss, because they never gained anything
to begin with. The loss will come to those who had no respect for people&#146;s rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For the fans of the &#147;peace process&#148;, I have only one thing to
say: You can process food or a hard math problem, but you cannot process the people&#146;s
right to be free.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Fifty-one years after the massacre at Deir Yassin, the smell of blood
is still fresh in the air. To mark the occasion, Daud Abdullah asks:</b></i></p>
<b>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">What would it take to heal the wounds?</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under normal circumstances, time can be a natural healer of wounds. The
atrocities committed at Deir Yassin on 9 April 1948 were, however, an exception to this
rule. Instead of alleviating their pain, time increased the agony of Deir Yassin&#146;s
survivors. To these victims, justice was never done, nor seen to be done, even though the
massacre constituted an appalling crime not only against themselves but also against
humanity. In any event, neither Ben Gurion&#146;s letter of apology to King Abdullah I of
Jordan nor the change of its name to Kafr Sha&#146;ul was enough to cover up the crime or
erase the memory of Deir Yassin. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">While the massacre remains a permanent symbol of Israeli brutality and
inhumanity, it was by no means an isolated event. Similar acts of barbarity against
civilians were executed with equal impunity throughout the last 50 years. If nothing else
changed during the period, the methods of mass murder certainly became more deadly and
devastating. The April 1996 bombing of the United Nations camp in Qana, southern Lebanon,
was, indeed, one of the more recent and staggering examples. There, over 100 old men,
women and children perished.<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(0,169) (273,204) {Zionist massacres: UN soldiers carry remains

<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Crimes and atrocities</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With regard to Deir Yassin itself, the murder of 254 defenceless
civilians was, without doubt, grossly reprehensible. Notwithstanding, the manner in which
this was done was itself more revolting. Here was a village whose inhabitants had entered
into an agreement of mutual non-aggression with the Jews from the neighbouring Givat Shaul
and Montefore settlements. In spite of that, the attack, it appeared, had become
absolutely necessary by April 1948 in order to induce the birth of Israel and make
Palestine as Jewish as England is English. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Zionists were, of course, not the only ones who were guilty of bad
faith. Having solemnly promised in the Balfour Declaration that &#147;nothing shall be
done which may prejudice the civil and religious rights of the existing non-Jewish
communities in Palestine&#148;, the British mandate failed to prevent the massacre.
Indeed, when the then-High Commissioner Sir Alan Cunningham heard of the killings, he
ordered his commander of ground forces, Lt. Gen. Gordon MacMillan, to send troops to Deir
Yassin. The latter refused, claiming that such an intervention was not in the pursuit of
British interests.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a result, the International Red Cross was the first party to reach
the village after the atrocity. Undeterred by Zionist threats to his personal safety,
Jacques de Reynier, its Swiss representative, found 150 bodies thrown into a cistern. Of
the total 254 which he counted, 145 were women, of whom 35 were pregnant. With the
memories of Nazi war crimes still fresh in his mind, de Reynier poignantly recalled;
&#147;All I could think of was the SS troops I had seen in Athens.&#148; </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Perpetrators and accomplices</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The killings at Deir Yassin were evidently consistent with the concept
of an exclusive Jewish State in Palestine. It accomplished the aim of creating fear among
the Palestinian population and accelerated their flight from the country after they were
attacked. Count Folke Bernadotte, the UN mediator, corroborated this when he wrote in his
report, &#147;The exodus of Palestinian Arabs resulted from panic created by fighting in
their communities, by remorse concerning real or alleged acts of terrorism, or
expulsion.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As it were, the violent &#147;transfer&#148; of the Palestinians was
the translation of a policy that was rooted in Zionist thought and espoused by the
Mandatory authority. Commenting on the partition proposal recommended by the Royal Peel
Commision, Ben Gurion wrote into his diary on 12 July 1937, &#147;The compulsory transfer
of the Arabs from the valleys of the proposed Jewish State could give us something which
we never had&#133;&#148; In the same manner, the British Government in its response to the
report issued a &#145;Statement of Policy&#146; on 20 July 1937 which read, in part,
&#147;It was assumed that provision would be made for the transfer of the greater part of
the Arab population in the Jewish State, if necessary by compulsion&#133;&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Dogged resistance from the Palestinians, however, obstructed the plan
in the late 1930s. Later, when the UN adopted its partition scheme in November 1947, the
Zionist transfer plan received a great boost. They were, in fact, encouraged and
emboldened by the Organization&#146;s decision to grant them 56% of Palestine, even though
they constituted a mere 32% of the population. This resolution, No. 181, was, in effect,
the green light for Haganah terrorists to begin as early as December 1947 the expulsion of
the Arabs from the core area of the designated Jewish State. By establishing the
Conciliation Committee for Palestine in December 1948 and the United Nations Relief and
Works Agency [UNRWA] the following year, the world body had, effectually, confirmed the
profound depths of its responsibility for the refugee problem. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Repatriation and justice</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite the cold indifference of the international community, Deir
Yassin failed to secure an exclusive State for the Jews in Palestine. True, it created a
mass exodus of Palestinian refugees. Yet, it failed to extirpate their national
aspirations. Hence, five decades after the event, the pain and memory of Deir Yassin
remains as clear-cut in their minds as if it occurred yesterday. And, because of their
conviction in the justice of their cause, they have, moreover, refused to surrender their
right to repatriation, having no doubt that this would, in due course, be the first and
not the last step toward the healing of their wound. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In reality, the return of the dispersed Palestinians to their homes and
property is not a privilege or favour that is subject to Israeli or American goodwill.
Neither is it a matter that depends upon Israel&#146;s &#147;demographic security&#148;
needs as Mr. Netanyahu suggests. Born as it were out of a violation of Palestinian rights,
international law obliges Israel and all those responsible for the expulsion to restore
the <i>status quo ante</i>. For this reason, the General Assembly reaffirmed in resolution
No. 3236, &#147;the inalienable right of the Palestinians to return to their homes and
property from which they have been displaced and uprooted, and calls for their
return.&#148; In equally strong and explicit language, the UN Committee on the Exercise of
the Inalienable Rights of the Palestinian People upheld that the Palestinian right of
return &#147;should be absolute for every Palestinian and must have priority over any
other form of substitute arrangements, such as compensation.&#148; That being the case,
the recent &#147;compromise&#148; plan drawn up by the academic forum sponsored by Harvard
University was dismissed as a non-starter in refugee circles. Its suggestion that Israel
would pay some compensation and share the practical, but not moral or legal,
responsibility for the Nakba (catastrophe) was condemned as a halfway measure that fell
far short of the basic requirements of justice.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Whatever the case, the fact remains that the forced expulsion of the
Palestinians was a crime so fundamental and unjust that no political
&#147;compromise&#148; would amend its damage. Apart from being a violation of the human
rights of the Palestinians, it also constituted a breach of international humanitarian law
as well as the law of nationality. In the first instance, mass expulsion is so
irreconcilable with respect for human rights that the Nuremberg Tribunal viewed it as a
&#147;crime against humanity&#148;. Thus, it was on this basis that when Israel tried
Adolf Eichman in 1961, it included charges of expulsion, declaring them &#147;war
crimes&#148; and &#147;crimes against humanity&#148;. Be that as it may, the displaced
Palestinians may not have powerful friends to champion their cause today, but should the
rule of law be restored to the international system tomorrow, they would definitely have
the full weight of history and the law on their side. There is, therefore, absolutely no
reason why they should under the present circumstances accept a &#147;compromise&#148;
solution that does not secure their fundamental rights or deliver justice. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Current attempts by the Clinton administration to transform the
Palestinian refugee problem into a local affair confirms the extent to which Washington
has deviated from the principles of its founding fathers. In 1891, when Czarist Russia
expelled the Jews, President Benjamin Harrison protested that &#147;the banishment,
whether by direct decree or by no less certain indirect methods, of so large a number of
men and women is not a local question.&#148; Similar protests were also made to Romania in
1902: again concerning its treatment of Jews who were forced by their government
&#147;upon the charity of the United States.&#148; With all this evidence on the table, it
is inconceivable that the United States should today seek to disregard the international
character of the Palestinian refugee problem. Throughout the past 50 years, all the
neighbouring host countries have suffered tremendous losses, militarily, territorially and
economically, as a result of this tragic and avoidable problem. Israel&#146;s excuse that
it has no capacity to absorb the dispersed Palestinians is both farcical and bizarre
because it is still importing Jewish settlers from the four corners of the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the birth of Jewish Israel in Palestine, Deir Yassin, like 530
other Arab villages, was erased from the map. Its tragic fate was naturally told in
Israeli history books as a spectacular military victory. On their part, the survivors of
Deir Yassin preserved its memory in the collective psyche of 7.5 million Palestinians, of
whom 4,942,121 are now refugees. To all of them, Deir Yassin is symbolic of the bitter
conflict and enormous opposition they are up against. One which in its organization,
methods, political philosophy and social appeal is very much akin to the oppressive
totalitarian ideologies of the early twentieth century.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If the atrocities committed at Deir Yassin will ever be assuaged, the
remedy must include a settlement of the Palestinian refugee problem on the basis of
international law. Whether Israel is inconvenienced or disturbed is irrelevant in this
matter. For justice must be done and seen to be done. The Palestinian demand is by no
means as extraordinary as their adversaries make it out to be. The Crimean Tartars, who
were deported internally by the Communist authorities for collaborating with the Germans
during the Second World War, were repatriated after the collapse of the Soviet Union. Is
it that the Palestinians should also await for the collapse of the other
&#147;superpower&#148; before they are repatriated?! They are prepared to wait and resist
for as long as it takes because the right to return is non-negotiable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Destined to be in perpetual struggle for survival against something or the
other, the Palestinians now have to struggle for their history. Imagine if you will, the
dreaded Nazis prevailing in World War II. How would the victor have written the story of
the vanquished? Search no further. Move over Hitler, here comes Morton Klein of the
Zionist Organizations of America to rewrite Palestinian history. The son of Holocaust
victims, Morton's offense of denying the Deir Yassin massacre is inexcusable. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Morton's strategy is simple. With Israel wielding absolute power over
destitute Palestinians. And with most of the eyewitnesses either killed in the massacre or
lost in exile. And with the only witnesses summoned are themselves supporters of or
killers from the Irgun and Stern Jewish terrorist groups this is the best time to call for
a retrial of the Deir Yassin massacre. It takes a person devoid of decency to pull a
Morton. Even Americans came to terms with their legacy of hate and found it in their
hearts to shed a tear or two on native Indians and African Americans, or even the
Vietnamese. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1948, bandits of terrorist Jewish organizations overran a Palestinian
village deemed strategic to Jewish defenses named Deir Yassin killing in the process
approximately 250-300 men, women, and children using tactics rivaling those of Serbian
ethnic cleansers ranging from rapes to mutilations. The objective of the massacre was to
spread fear and panic which effectively sent thousands of unarmed Palestinian farmers
fleeing for their lives from surrounding villages. British, Red Cross, and even some
Israeli accounts corroborated the massacre as well as the few survivors who fled the
village in the chaos that ensued. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But according to Morton and his henchmen, the massacre was a fabrication
to scar the unblemished history of Israel and tarnish the reputation of its heroic
worriers. Israel, they would like us to believe is a another biblical miracle that just
happened. A ripe apple falling from a tree branch right into their pockets. What about
millions of Palestinian refugees? It was their decision to leave, many Jews would argue. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With Palestinians vilified and deprived of their history, Israel is left
standing as a righteous victor with no wrongs to right. But had it not been for
well-documented and impartial accounts of the Palestinian tragedy, many horror stories
would have gone untold and the Palestinian history would have sunk into the abyss with
others who have vanished from history. But much to Morton's dismay, this is not the case.
Morton's backup plan as we are learning is to deny, deny, deny; discredit, discredit,
discredit. As if loosing the future to Israel was not bad enough, Palestinians now have to
defend the legacy of their suffering from sinking into an Israeli-made oblivion. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The recent Jewish extremists campaign to discredit Deir Yassin as a
fabrication reeks with hypocrisy when contrasted with Jewish ultra-sensitivity to
Holocaust denials or revisionism. Not surprisingly, the litany of third-rate polemics
meant to rebut the body of evidence accumulated along the years is finding an audience in
the US amongst the religious right and parroted by beneficiaries of pro-Israeli moneys.
And why not. If Sharon can be legally cleared in a New York court (of all the places) from
his role in the Sabra &amp; Shatila massacre in Lebanon, why can&#146;t we clear the
perpetrators of Deir Yassin, who some would like you to believe were honorable soldiers
engaged in a war of survival oblivious to civilian casualty. Morton can teach the Bosnian
Serbs a few lessons. </p>
<font SIZE="2">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font><font size="3">According to Morton's law of nature, Rawandan Tutsis
and Bosnian Muslims have no legitimate claims to victimhood. Their losses were collateral
damage in a fair fight with winners and losers. But why look too far. Following Morton's
logic, were Jewish casualties of World War II mere collateral damage too? What would Elie
Wiesel think of Morton's reasoning, or its absence. And if we can't argue scientifically
that exactly 6 million Jews were killed by the Nazis and their allies, does that discredit
the Holocaust. What about the tens of thousands of Palestinians who have perished over
half a century as a result of Israeli violence and the travails of exodus and destitution.
Overtaken by his hate, Morton must have forgotten that his tactics are a double-edged
sword which cuts both ways. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Morton is not interested in truth. No religious and ultra-nationalist
ideologue was ever interested in truth and justice. Morton is a man with a loathsome
agenda of hate and a Meir Kahana incarnate for the 21st century. Every generation has its
prophets of hate. The Israelis traded their prophet of peace Itzhak Rabin for Binjamin
Netanyahu and Morton Klein. That's a bum deal. The world according to Morton is a world of
myth. But in the wrong environment myth flourishes with the same vigor as truth does. Only
the voices of decency will ensure myth is never confused with truth by the coming
generations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At this juncture of Palestinian and Jewish history, sides have mostly been
taken. Attempts at revisionism only serve to supply ammunition for a debate most of us
have grown wary of. This debate serves no purpose but to widen a chasm already dangerously
stretched. In an era of Palestinian-Israeli reconciliation, Morton rises from the ashes as
an anachronism whose only contribution is to gain prominence by slapping around the
despondent Palestinians at a time when Israel's 50th anniversary celebration signals the
50th anniversary of the obliteration of the Palestinian identity. After all, Palestinians
today do make an easy target for aspiring extremist Jews. Out numbered and out moneyed;
oppressed and exhausted, the Palestinians can only do so much. The burden to continue to
tell the truth falls on the shoulder of every decent person who still believe in peace,
justice, and truth. That includes Jews too. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Rafah</b>- A popular mini intifadah against Yasser Arafat&#146;s
Palestinian Authority (PA) engulfed much of the town of Rafah following the passing by a
special military court in Gaza of a death penalty by a firing squad on one of the
residents of a nearby refugee camp.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trouble began on 10 March, when the PA &#147;State Security
Court&#148; (originally founded at Yitshak Rabin&#146;s insistence to carry out speedy
trials of militant activists accused of carrying out attacks against Israeli targets)
sentenced Ra&#146;ed al Attar to death by a firing squad for his role in the fatal
shooting of Rifa&#146;at Judeh, a Preventive Security Officer, during a chase in Khan
Younis on 1 February.<!--webbot bot="ImageMap" text="(1,206) (209,243) {al Attar (right), Abu Shammala and 
Taha during the trial} {Times New Roman} 10 B #ff0000 CT 0  " src="hamas_prisoners.gif" alt="hamas prisoners.jpg (62696 bytes)" align="right" border="1" hspace="2" vspace="2" u-originalsrc="hamas_prisoners.gif" u-overlaysrc="_overlay/articles.html_txt_hamas_prisoners.gif" startspan --><!--webbot bot="ImageMap" endspan i-checksum="0" --></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Two of Attar&#146;s colleagues, Muhammed abu Shammala and Osama Ali
Taha, were also sentenced to life and 15 years imprisonment with hard labour respectively
for their &#147;indirect role&#148; in the incident.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The trial itself, described invariably by human rights organizations as
&#147;farcical and theatrical&#148;, was conducted on the basis of a PLO revolutionary law
dating back to 1979, which critics say has more to do with revolution than with law,
whereby a defendant is granted no real chance to defend himself. </p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Lack of evidence</b><br>
When the five police officers comprising the prosecution board announced their verdict on
10 March, they utterly failed to cite unequivocal evidence proving that Judeh was actually
killed by Attar, as the defense demanded all along.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, far from establishing a definite causative relationship between
Attar and Judeh&#146;s death, the five officers, who have little or no genuine legal
training, argued repeatedly that since the bullet that killed Judeh was lost (!!), it was
impossible to produce tangible &#147;material evidence&#148; to condemn Judeh.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In other words, the court had to rely on &#147;circumstantial
evidence&#148;, effectively ignoring a mass of counter-evidence, including witness&#146;s
testimonies that made it clear that Attar was not seen firing at, on or toward Judeh.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">For his part, Attar, who insisted throughout the trial that he was
innocent, accused the police of concealing the fatal bullet that killed Judeh in order to
avoid an internal PA scandal in case forensic tests proved the bullet was fired from a
weapon carried by one of Judeh&#146;s Preventive Security Force (PSF) colleagues. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Indeed, the prosecution refused to give a real hearing to Attar&#146;s
above-mentioned accusation, arguing that police testimony to that effect was indisputable
evidence against the defendant. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Predictably, this infuriated Attar, who shouted in anger after hearing
the verdict, &#147;this is proof that justice does not exist here.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Interestingly, many, probably most, Palestinians, along with human
rights activists, lawyers and jurists, seem to have come to the same conclusion.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Police open fire on Rafah protesters</b><br>
No sooner had the military court handed down its verdict than hundreds of the
defendants&#146; relatives took to the streets in Rafah and the tiny refugee camp of Yibna
nearby, shouting slogans against PA security chiefs and demanding the dissolution of the
State security court.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The ostensibly spontaneous protest quickly gathered momentum, as angry
youths began setting tyres on fire, turning garbage containers upside-down and hurling
stones at the police.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The police, unequipped with anti-riot gear and generally undisciplined
and poorly trained to confront riots, opened fire on the demonstrators, killing two of
them on the spot&#151;namely Ala&#146;a al Hums, 16, and Khamis Salameh, 17&#151;and
injuring four others.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The spilling of blood further enraged the peoples of Rafah,
particularly the relatives and friends of Attar.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;Arafat: pull out your dogs from the streets&#148;, shouted
hundreds of young activists in unison, as others pelted policemen with stones and empty
bottles. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">On Thursday, 11 March, hundreds of townspeople clashed once again with
policemen, demanding that the death sentence be repealed, and the military court be
terminated.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Both the police and protesters hurled stones at each other, resulting
in scores of injuries on both sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The PA sought initially to impose a blackout on the protests in Rafah.
The PA radio station, Sawt Falastin (a mouthpiece for the PA security apparatus), claimed
that &#147;suspicious elements were trying to foment trouble in Rafah and the police
succeeded in restoring calm.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a terse statement, Sawt Falastin (the Voice of Palestine) claimed
that at least one of the two victims was actually shot by Israeli soldiers while the other
was hit by a random bullet.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">This is, of course, totally unfounded, and even PA officials and
Legislative Council members didn&#146;t take this account seriously.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Twisting the facts</b><br>
The Rafah protests took PA officials by surprise, which explains why Sawt Falastin
resorted to disseminating misinformation and the outright twisting of facts. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">PA Secretary-General Al Tayeb Abdul Rahim accused &#147;certain
political groups (an obvious allusion to Hamas) of seeking to twist the arms of the
Palestinian Authority.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Abdul Rahim went as far as suggesting that the protests constituted
&#147;a preview for a possible coup.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, Gaza PA police chief Ghazi al Jabali attacked the
protesters saying, &#147;they were agents of foreign powers hostile to our national
interests.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He alluded that Hamas and Iran were behind &#147;this act of political
prostitution&#148; in Rafah, saying that &#147;since the protesters were carrying green
and black banners, it was clear that Iran was standing behind the unrest.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Jabali&#146;s remarks were dismissed by Hamas officials as &#147;cheap
rhetoric reflecting cheapness in character.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One Hamas official, who asked that his name not be mentioned, described
Jabali as &#147;a pathetic figure&#148; and one &#147;whose tongue functions much more
swiftly than his mind does.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;It is clear that PA officials resort to this kind of hysterical
reaction whenever they are exposed before the people; their reactions prove only that they
are politically bankrupt and morally unsound&#148;, said the Islamist official.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sheikh Ahmed Yassin, in a telephone interview from his Gaza home,
described Jabali&#146;s accusations that Hamas organized the protests as &#147;false from
beginning to end&#148;, since the unrest broke out immediately after the court issued its
verdict, which indicated the protests were spontaneous. (Jabali and other PA police
officials later admitted that the protests were indeed spontaneous.) </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yassin argued that the protesters were only protesting &#147;the state
of lawlessness, the absence of justice, and the nonexistence of the authority of law&#148;
under the Palestinian Authority regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yassin castigated the death penalty passed by the State Security Court
on Attar, saying it was &#147;neither just nor legal.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#147;You can&#146;t just send a person to the gallows if you
aren&#146;t absolutely sure he is guilty&#148;, adding that cases such Attar&#146;s ought
to be tried before a civilian court where the defendant or defendants can defend
themselves properly, away from &#147;the hasty revolutionary justice characterizing the
State Security Court.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yassin&#146;s critical objections were echoed by most legalistic
circles and human rights activists in the autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Furthermore, Basem Eid, Director of the Palestinian Human Rights
Monitoring Group, dismissed the entire trial of Attar and his two colleagues as
&#147;another absurd expression of lawlessness under the PA.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He said, &#147;The verdict and the trial were illegal because we
don&#146;t have a real judicial system&#148;, adding that the latest death penalty was
handed down under public pressure and carried out in a short time, in ways that deprive
the defendant of the opportunity to defend himself.<br>
What Eid and Yassin didn&#146;t say is the fact that the PA doesn&#146;t have a judicial
system.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Recently, when Abbas Zaki (a high-ranking Fatah official) was asked why
the PA failed to establish a genuine civil judicial system whereas it succeeded in
building an effective security apparatus, Zaki&#146;s answer was very telling. He said,
&#147;You know security comes before the law.&#148;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat asks for help</b><br>
Upon returning to Gaza from a visit to Britain and the Netherlands, PA President Yasser
Arafat met with civic leaders in Rafah and asked them to restore calm. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">He promised that he would review the death sentence and find out who
killed the two protesters in Rafah on 10 March.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Arafat reportedly ordered the formation of another commission of
inquiry into the events that culminated in the death of the two Rafah youngsters. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">However, it seems that more and more Palestinians are skeptical of
Arafat&#146;s will, even inclination, to see to it that the authority of law is respected
within the PA autonomous enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In a society where the law of the Authority, e.g. security and
political interests, overrides the authority of the law, many Palestinians are forced to
seek justice through clan power.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That same clan power was behind the execution of a PA officer (who was
convicted of raping a six-year old child) for inciting the masses against the Authority. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Clan power was also obviously behind the passing of the death penalty
on Attar, and clan power was the moving force behind Arafat&#146;s decision to commute
Attar&#146;s sentence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Incidentally, it was Yasser Arafat personally who encouraged the
revival of clan loyalties five years ago in an effort to fight Hamas on the popular level.<br>
Now he is facing the boomerang effect.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme></font><font SIZE="5" color="#FF0000">The new Israeli historians</font><i><b></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Dr. Musil J Shihadeh*</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is very hard to discern the mystery of history surrounding the
Arab-Israeli conflict without going into conflicting accounts of what really happened.
Subjective history has played a very important role in achieving certain political ends,
which under normal circumstances would not have been achieved. Massive Zionist propaganda,
following the Arab-Israeli wars during the period 1947-1948, targeting the receptive
Western media, have succeeded beyond any normal expectations in polarizing Western public
opinion in unlimited support of the Zionist State. The war of uprooting an entire
indigenous people from their homes and properties in Palestine, consequently turning them
into tragic refugees while replacing them with foreign Jewish invaders coming from all
over the world, was successfully turned into the justified Jewish &#147;war of
liberation&#148; in the eyes of the world. The vastly deficient pro-Arab position to
rectify the picture was buried overwhelmingly by the strong massive Zionist propaganda.
Indubitably the victim and the victimizer have exchanged places in the eyes of the world
and historical truths have reached a very low standard if events are to conform to what
really happened. A Palestinian who lost his home, property, his family, his right to
return to his home and his simple human rights was utterly devastated when confronted with
new clichs of being a terrorist and a barbarian and an aggressor against those who were
seeking normal &#147;freedom&#148;. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With such unmitigated success, the Zionists went further in their
unrelenting quest to paint unblemished pictures of the making of their own version of
history, so that such pictures would be instilled into their own new Israeli generation.
Why destroy the romantic image of the Zionist pioneers in the minds of the new generation
when the alternative is to unveil a grotesque picture of gangs who killed, uprooted and
dispossessed innocent civilians who happened to be non-Jewish? With such motives, real
history has been lost in the archives of Zionist propaganda and Israel emerged as the
moral and victorious underdog in the formula of the Middle Eastern history. The battle to
unveil the truth is one that leads any researcher to an uphill difficult road, which in
the end would lead you nowhere. With the 30-year secret Israeli filing system
notwithstanding, many of the documents are still not available to the Israeli researchers,
while the diaries of those who were directly involved in the conflict were
&#147;doctored&#148; so as to conform to the general clean picture of Israeli history.
Even then these documents are still restricted to the neutral researcher and the Israeli
Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which would give you the run-around if you were to seek the
truth. But, of course, with an apologetic smile that such documents do not exist. To make
the job of the truth-seeker almost impossible, even in the event that you could extract
such documents, you would still be confronted with opposing and contradictory entries in
the diaries of the Zionist forefathers such as Ben-Gurion, J. Weitz, M. Begin and others. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Ben-Gurion, who practically represented a very important part in the
history of establishing the Zionist State, used a double standard in promoting the making
of the State. In most of his private undertakings, he advocated compulsory transfer, a
euphemism for expulsions, as the ultimate solution to the Palestinian problem, while
publicly he called for peaceful coexistence with the indigenous Palestinians. Such
double-standard positions confused the historians and obstructed their mission of reaching
the truth of what happened. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is against this gloomy background that the &#147;New&#148; Israeli
historians emerged on the Israeli scene to try to answer the very important question: Was
Israel born in sin? Of course the answer to this question was very well known to many Arab
historians, but not to many Israelis. A few documents that escaped &#147;doctoring&#148;
were used to unveil some of the truths of the past, including the diaries of Ben-Gurion,
J. Weitz of the JNF, the British sources, the history of the Hagana and a few others.
Israeli historians such as Simha Flapan, Benny Morris, Ilan Pappe and Norman
Finkelstein&#151;to name a few&#151;have undertaken the difficult task of unveiling the
truth about the history of Israel that can obliterate the myths that have been propagated
about the clean image of Israel in the eyes of the world as much as in the eyes of the
Israeli public. Several books were written that unveil some of the truths, which have
created a shock-wave that undermined the moral foundations of Israeli society which,
consequently, created a different outlook on the peace process with the Palestinians. Such
books as<i> The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem</i> by Benny Morris, <i>The
Making of the Arab-Israeli Conflict</i> by Ilan Pappe, the <i>Image and Reality of the
Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</i> by Norman Finkelstein or the <i>Birth of Israel</i> by
Simha Flapan are only a few works that have surfaced recently on the scene of
Israel&#146;s history, which had a devastating effect on the &#147;old historians&#148;,
as they catered immensely to the honest truth. Some of the revelations espoused by these
new historians dispel the myth of the Biblical claim as a nave contention that holds no
legal or moral ground. Another myth that the Palestinians left &#147;of their own
accord&#148; or in conformity with the AHC commands to do so was exposed through these
works as they document plans to systematically cleanse all areas from its non-Jewish
populations by the use of force, including heinous massacres such as those that took place
in Haifa, Safad and Dir Yassin, to name a few. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">If evicting the Palestinians was merely an accident of the war, argues
the new historians, why would Israel practice the same policy in times of cease-fire when
over 40 villages were uprooted after 1950 and dumped across the Jordan River? and why the
expulsions now? H. Weizman used to propagate that the creation of Israel was a divine
miraculous act when the tiny Israeli army repulsed the attacking seven Arab armies whose
numbers were overwhelmingly in the ratio of 20 to 1 favouring the Arabs. Ilan Pappe, a
professor of history at Haifa University, retorted by saying it was not a miracle but the
stronger side won, and the Hagana, better equipped militarily, numbered 2 to 1 in favour
of the Israeli side! Furthermore, he contends that even with an inferior force on the Arab
side, they did not fight as secret agreements made the Arab presence a public-relations
practice. When some of the army units decided to fight, they were able to liberate the old
city of Jerusalem against an overwhelming numerical Israeli advantage.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the truth comes out from the horse&#146;s mouth, it should behoove
our historians to embark on a new mission of unveiling the chronology of events that have
taken place and which resulted in the tragedy of the Palestinians. It is a shame that
until this date in time our historians have not ventured into the whole truth because such
an endeavour might place them in a compromising position with certain Arab leaderships. I
think exposing the final truth regardless of any retribution should be a superior motive
in preserving the integrity of history. </p>

Presidential election season nears</font></b></font mstheme></h3>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ray Hanania*</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In much the same manner as the flu, outrageous acts of pandering to
Israel and its supporters returns to afflict the members of the United States Congress.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">How else does one explain a one-sided, irrelevant resolution with no
teeth spewing a lot of anti-Arab hatred and ignoring America&#146;s self-proclaimed role
as the champion of righteousness and justice?</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. House of Representatives&#151;often referred to correctly as
&#147;Israeli Occupied Territory&#148;&#151;approved a non-binding resolution urging
President Clinton to use all means to prevent the Palestinian People from exercising their
inalienable rights to nationhood.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resolution, sponsored by dozens of the most right-wing extremists
ever to wear a congressional pin on their lapels&#151;by a lopsided vote of 380 to
24&#151;arrogantly declares that the United States should not recognize a Palestinian
State if such a State is declared by Palestinian President Yasser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The resolution, in the highest form of pontificating hypocrisy yet,
further asserts that such a declaration is a &#147;grievous violation of the Oslo
accords.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Are we still talking about that dead agreement? &#147;Dead Man
Walking&#148; is how the peace agreement is now introduced at the few and far between
meetings of Palestinian and Israeli Oslo negotiators.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And while the members of Congress scrambled atop one another to
&#147;out-Israel&#148; each other in denouncing, decrying and defiling legitimate
Palestinian rights, they were blind to the real issue of Israeli violations, such as the
continuation of Israel&#146;s &#147;illegal&#148; policy to steal more Arab land and
establish more racist, exclusively Jewish and anti-Arab settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Many Palestinians are beside themselves about the actions of the U.S.
Congress, followed by a similar vote by the U.S. Senate (98 to 1).</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I&#146;m not angry. And, I&#146;m not surprised either.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The adoption of the resolution only proves what most intelligent people
have known for years: the U.S. Congress is a pathetic representative of the virtues of
human and civil rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I must, however, offer my true adulation to the 24 brave members of the
United States House of Representatives who voted against this obscene act of political
criminality.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">These 24 members of Congress deserve deepest admiration.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We all know that any idiot can stand up and praise Israel. Any coward
can stand up with his or her hand extended outwardly in the face of millions in
Israeli-funded political action committee bribes.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">That is so uncourageous.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What is courageous is to know that you are going to lose a vote, and
yet stand up for what is right and what is just and what is fair, in much the same way
that the American forefathers stood up more than 200 years ago in the face of a similar
aggression from the British government.</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Those 24 congressmen epitomize the meaning of &#147;profiles in
  courage&#148;.</p>

  <p ALIGN="RIGHT"><strong>Sacred Space: The Holiness of Islamic Jerusalem</i>, Karen

  <font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>In an opinion piece, <i>Jerusalem
  is Uniquely Jewish</i>, Mr. James Michael Price stated:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Jerusalem is not a question. It is the central surviving legacy of my
    religion and ancient nationality. If modern Israelis cannot legitimately and morally claim
    the city that was the capital of Israel earlier and longer than most modern nations ever

    to a piece of the planet?</p>
  </blockquote>
  <font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4"><p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>In an occasional paper
  entitled <i>Jerusalem in History</i>, Mr. Kamil Jamil Asali argues:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In simple terms historical evidence clearly establishes that the
    Palestinians of today are the decedents of the original and true owners of the land.
    Moreover, the argument that the Jewish decedents of the Israelites can claim current
    ownership based on their presence before all other peoples is not supported by historical
    evidence.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>According to Rabbi Elmer Berger, ex-president of the Jewish League
in the United States:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The present-day political Israel has for all of us obliterated, or at
    least adumbrated, the spiritual Israel. When the prophets evoked the restoration of Zion,
    it was not the land itself that was of a sacred nature. The absolute and indisputable
    criteria of the prophetic concept of the redemption was the restoration of the alliance
    with God, at a time when the alliance had been broken by the king and his people. Micah
    spells it out clearly, &#147;Hear, I pray you, O heads of Jacob, and ye princes of the
    house of Israel that abhor judgment and pervert all equity. They build up Zion with blood,
    and Jerusalem with inequity ... Therefore shall Zion for your sake be plowed as a field,
    and Jerusalem shall become heaps, and the mountain of the house as the high place of the
    forest.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>There is not a Muslim, Christian, or Jewish scholar to argue
against the fact that Jerusalem under the Muslim Caliph, Umar bin al Khattab, was a place
of worship for the people of all faiths. According to Karen Armstrong, it has been said
that Muslims never bothered to make Jerusalem the capital of their empire or even the
administrative capital of Palestine, and that this is a sign of their fundamental
indifference to the Holy City. But this is not the case. In fact, it seems that the
Umayyad Caliphs did consider the possibility of making Jerusalem their capital instead of
Damascus. </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Turning from the religious and historical argument to the political
argument, John Quigley, a professor of law at the Ohio State University and a member of
the bar of the United States Supreme Court, states:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians claim Jerusalem on the basis of their longtime status as
    the majority population in Palestine. They claim descendants from the Canaanites,
    Palestine&#146;s earliest recorded inhabitants. In 1988, the Palestine National Council
    proclaimed &#147;the establishment of the State of Palestine on Palestinian territory with
    its capital in Jerusalem&#148;, the State to encompass the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.
    Israel claims sovereignty over the territory it has controlled since it declared Statehood
    in 1948. That claim covers the western sector of Jerusalem. Israel also claims sovereignty
    over the eastern sector of Jerusalem, which it has held since 1967. Like the Palestinians,
    Israel makes a claim based on occupation. Israel claims to be heir to the Hebrew Kingdom
    of ancient times in Palestine. The 1948 declaration of the Establishment of the State of
    Israel referred to &#147;our natural and historic right&#148; to the territory of
    Palestine. Ancient title that has been superseded by occupation by others, however, is not
    regarded in international law as giving rise to sovereign rights. Even if it were, the
    Palestinians can legitimately claim occupation predating the Hebrew Kingdom.</p>
  </blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">He further asserts:</p>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Regarding East Jerusalem, they have taken the view expressed by the UN
    Security Council that this territory is under Israel&#146;s belligerent occupation. Israel
    has presented no persuasive argument for any sovereign rights in Jerusalem. Its
    potentially strong argument, relating to the United Nations partition proposal, is
    irrelevant to Jerusalem because the United Nations recommended a special status for the
    city. On the other hand, the Palestinians as the longtime majority inhabitants of
    Palestine, including Jerusalem, have a strong claim. The fact that so many of them were
    displaced during the 1948 hostilities does not derogate from their claim.</p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Jerusalem: The United States and the Political
Options</font></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font></b>The flow of ideas on how to solve the problem of the Holy City
have not stopped since the beginning of the peace process. These ideas have taken into
account various visions and suggestions. Some can be described as realistic. Others cannot
lead to peaceful, lasting solutions, but rather only to an explosive beginning to future
problems.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>These ideas have the attention and concern of various official U.S.
agencies, the hallways of major academic and research centres, and the media. Some look at
the future of Jerusalem from the view that the Palestinian issue and the Arab-Israeli
conflict will be resolved by the establishment of an independent Palestinian State or
Palestinian-Jordanian confederation, or Israeli-Jordanian-Palestinian federation.
Jerusalem, in this framework, is the major problem. In the case of an independent
Palestinian State, East Jerusalem is the capital of this State. In a Palestinian-Jordanian
confederation, Jerusalem would have a special religious and political status. Its doors
would be open to followers of all religions without complications or restrictions.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Any of these scenarios is hostage to the future of Palestinian
independence. This means moving from limited self-rule to (the dream of) independence and
sovereignty.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Here is a summarized overview of some of the Western plans for
Jerusalem, whether they were penned by Arab, Muslim, Christian, or Jewish thinkers and
politicians. Their common ground is that they discuss these ideas in the Western media and
in academic and political think-tanks.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">1. Two capitals in an Undivided Jerusalem</b></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>This suggestion was proposed by Jordanian diplomat Adnan Abu Odeh,
who was a researcher at the Centre for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS).</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Abu Odeh says that the Holy City can be divided into three parts
based on its three names: Al-Quds, Jerusalem and Yerushaleim. Jerusalem is the truly holy
part of the Holy City, and is the area inside the walls of the Old City. This part should
not be the property of any one State or religion, but of the entire world and all three
divinely-inspired religions. Jerusalem would remain a spiritual place, as it was
historically and as it is considered to be by the world.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The Israeli and Palestinian flags should fly over the two other
parts, Yerushaleim and Al-Quds. Jerusalem would have no flags. Jerusalem can be governed
by a council comprising the highest religious leaders of the three religions. Every
religion is responsible for maintaining its own holy sites and they all share equally in
managing the city&#146;s (Jerusalem&#146;s) affairs. As for the political identity of its
residents, the Arabs will be Palestinian residents who vote in their national
institutions. The Jews will be Israelis and vote&#151;as they do now&#151;in their
national elections. The details of Jerusalem&#146;s administration would be left for
negotiations. As for the Jewish settlements in Al-Quds, they would fall under the same
arrangement that the settlements in the rest of the occupied territories do.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">2. A Bi-National State with Jerusalem as its Capital</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font></b>This option is found in studies and interviews with
Palestinian-Americans like Dr. Muhammad Rabi&#146; and Dr. Edward Said. They feel the best
solution is to give up the illusion of a Palestinian State with limited sovereignty. If
the occupied territories were to merge with Israel into a bi-national State, Palestinians
would have freedom of movement and residence anywhere in historic Palestine. Such ideas
are also found in the writings of Norman Kurland and Yitzhak Khayutman (Haissman) on the
Holyland Federation.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">3. Two states with Joint Sovereignty over the Holy City</p>
</b><font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Attorney and international relations expert John Whitbeck proposed
this in his article, &#147;Jerusalem as Condominium&#148;, or two States and one holy
land. It is based on persuading Israelis that Jerusalem is important to both Israelis and
Palestinians, and that it is a spiritual centre for the faithful of all divinely-inspired
religions. Therefore, the city must be shared. To look at it with the &#147;winner takes
all&#148; attitude will inevitably lead to everyone&#146;s loss&#151;Israelis and
Palestinians.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Whitbeck believes that since Jerusalem has psychological, symbolic,
religious and existential meaning for all, there can be a way to reach an understanding on
joint sovereignty for an undivided Jerusalem. Municipal affairs could be handled by joint
Palestinian-Israeli committees, giving each side jurisdiction over the neighbourhoods
where they have a majority. Of course, there are details having to do with the political
and religious affairs of each side.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Since the West seems to be talking about the possibility of an
independent Palestinian State, dealing with the proposals on Jerusalem under a
confederation or federation would necessarily be a second step after Palestine&#146;s
independence. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, there are Arab and Islamic parties strongly proposing an
Islamic/Arab solution for Jerusalem. Considering that Islam has been an element of
stability for the Holy City historically, Professor Ismail Faruqi wrote, &#147;Muslims
worship God through the love of Moses and Jesus; bear no ill will against the followers of
those prophets; and the history of the Holy City shows that the Muslims were good hosts
and neighbours for Jews and Christians.&#148;</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>This proposal, despite having some support among Christians in the
West, gives way to the majority desire to have a &#147;Holy City for all&#148;, where
sovereignty would be shared by Israelis and Palestinians, and religious affairs would be
governed by an Islamic-Christian-Jewish council. According to Karen Armstrong, the best
selling author and distinguished religious specialist who recently published <i>Jerusalem,
One City, Three Faiths</i>:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Muslim rule sustained the most notable period of coexistence among the
    three faiths in Jerusalem from 638 to 1039. The calmest period was when Muslims ruled
    there for 400 years after the Caliph Umar ruled over the city in 638 A.D.; this was also
    the case when Saladin recaptured it from the Crusaders.</p>
    <b>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">4. Two Cities: Yerushalayim and Al-Quds</b></p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>The newest idea to surface on the issue of Jerusalem was addressed
in an article written by Jerome Segal, director of the Jerusalem project at the University
of Maryland&#146;s Center for International and Security Studies. According to Mr. Segal:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Much of the common wisdom about the non-negotiability of Jerusalem is
    mistaken and overstated. Two extensive, recently concluded studies of Palestinian and
    Israeli Jewish perspectives on Jerusalem...are reshaping our understanding of the limits
    of negotiability. The first step toward finding a solution to the Jerusalem question is to
    go beyond talking about Jerusalem per se, as if there were a single coherent entity.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>Mr. Segal&#146;s theory is that Jews and Muslims have very clear
ideas as to which parts of the political Jerusalem they have any right to claim.
Surprisingly, according to Mr. Segal, each side is able to recognize some claimed right of
the other to that segment of Jerusalem that is claimed most sacred to each group. He says
that, according to studies conducted inside Jerusalem, &#147;the areas of great importance
to both peoples encompass less than 2% of the city, the Old City and the Mount of
Olives.&#148; This &#147;underlying differentiation&#148;, in Mr. Segal&#146;s opinion,
suggests that it may be possible to resolve the Jerusalem issue by establishing two
cities, Yerushalayim and Al-Quds (the Hebrew and Arabic names for Jerusalem). The Old
City, the core of Jerusalem for both peoples, would be a point of overlap, included in
both cities. As to administration and the issue of sovereignty, Mr. Segal suggests that
either both sides ritualistically affirm sovereignty over the Old City and work out a
day-to-day agreement for handling affairs, or both States can agree that sovereignty over
the Old City is not held by any one State, but by both States together, and agree upon a
plan for joint administration.</p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>A novel idea introduced by King Hussein of Jordan, which attracted
the approval of 44% of the Jews and 77% of the Palestinians, is the idea that sovereignty
over the Holy City belongs to God alone. This idea has not received much serious
consideration, but seems to be the idea upon which the majority of Jews and Palestinians
agree. The problem is that this answer offers no clear indication as to how a city of God
should be administered and opens the door to a dispute that could be as heated as the one
it seeks to resolve. </p>

  depends on a sense of holistic vision, which has been in extremely short supply in recent
  years both among secular humanists and among those who emphasize the transcendent nature
  of reality. The recent emergence of Islam as the only rival to American global hegemony
  has crystalized the conflict between the vision of &#147;stability&#148; and &#147;power
  or conflict management,&#148; which often masquerades under the images of
  &#147;freedom&#148; and &#147;democracy,&#148; and the other, which is a vision of
  &#147;justice&#148; based on an ecumenical and transcendent source of authority.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The greatest challenge specifically for Muslims is not only to purify
  themselves individually through <i>tazkiyah</i> or &#147;remembrance of Allah&#148; in the
  <i>jihad al akbar</i> or &#147;greatest jihad,&#148; but to wage the <i>jihad al kabir</i>
  or &#147;great jihad&#148; called for in <i>Surah al Furqan 25:52, wa jihidhum bihi
  jihadan kabiran, </i>&#147;and struggle with it [the Qur&#146;an] in a great jihad.&#148;
  This is the intellectual struggle to apply the message of the Qur&#146;an in intellectual
  discourse as a means to shape humankind&#146;s civilizational future, so that in the
  twenty-first century after Christ there will be no more <i>Dar al Harb </i>or lands
  dominated by enemies of Islam, and therefore there will be no more need for activists in
  Muslim-majority countries, known collectively as <i>Dar al Islam, </i>to wage the <i>jihad
  al sagheer</i> or lesser Jihad to defend human rights by countering force with force.
  Although the intermediate zone, known as <i>Dar al Zulm</i> or Lands of Ignorance, will
  continue to exist, this should be not a cause of war but an occasion for competition in
  doing good, as called for in the Qur&#146;an, so that cooperation can be the norm and
  conflicts can be resolved by peaceful engagement.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The key to operationalizing the <i>jihad al kabir,</i> which is the only <i>jihad</i>
  specifically mentioned in the Qur&#146;an, is grand strategy. As defined in the articles
  of incorporation of the Islamic Institute for Strategic Studies, &#147;grand strategy is
  an intellectual framework and methodology for apply the art of vision and mission. This is
  accomplished by: 1) conceptualizing and analyzing reality from the most comprehensive and
  holistic perspective; 2) forecasting the dynamics of change; 3) planning proactively to
  shape the short-range and long-run future by continuing desirable trends and initiating
  desirable new trends; and 4) making decisions through management by objectives.&#148; </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The essence of the grand strategy of <i>jihad al kabir</i> is <i>hikmah</i>
  or wisdom. The primary source of wisdom for all levels of humankind, are the basic
  responsibilities and corresponding rights spelled out in the Islamic <i>shari&#146;ah,</i>
  and especially in its inner essence, which is known as the <i>maqasid </i>(purposes), <i>kulliyat
  </i>(universal principles), or <i>dururiyat </i>(essentials) developed over many centuries
  of the best minds engaged in <i>&#145;usul al fiqh.</i> </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">These form humankind&#146;s first formal code of human rights, formulated
  as responsibilities, without which in practice there can be no rights. These are the
  duties to respect life (<i>haqq al haya</i>); family and community (<i>haqq al nasl</i>);
  private and broad-based ownership in the means of production (<i>haqq al mal</i>);
  political freedom (<i>haqq al hurriyah</i>); dignity of the person - including freedom of
  religion and gender equity - (<i>haqq al karama</i>); and knowledge - including freedom of
  expression subject to the first five human rights - (<i>haqq al &#145;ilm</i>). </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The second universal principle of Islamic law, <i>haqq al nasl,</i> would
  provide the basis for Palestine and Israel, as equal sovereign states, to form a Holy Land
  Federation designed to secure the group right of nationhood for each people, without
  jeopardizing the independent status of the world&#146;s symbolic religious capital,
  Jerusalem. This was first proposed as a 50-page position paper in my book of five papers
  on the key foreign policy issues for the 1968 presidential campaign, entitled <i>New
  Directions for American Foreign Policy,</i> with a preface by the then House Minority
  Leader, Gerald Ford.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The inner dimension of grand strategy is summarized by the section
  entitled &#147;The Search for Justice and the Quest for Virtue: The Two Basics of Islamic
  Law,&#148; in the forthcoming book by Muzaffar Haleem and Betty Bowman, <i>The Sun is
  Rising in the West. </i>Unfortunately, this holistic exposition of Islamic law developed
  by Prophet Muhammad ( ) and his student, &#145;Ali ( ), and perfected by Ibn Taymiyah and
  his contemporaries, Ibn Qayyim and Al Shatibi, has been dead for six hundred years. Upon
  its revival as guidance for policy-making hangs the future of the world. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>IV. Tipping the Scales for Wisdom in Washington</strong></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">As a former insider, I can verify that wisdom within the halls of power in
  Washington is never absent. And sometimes it prevails over the false gods of power,
  plutocracy, privilege, and pleasure. Wisdom usually does not prevail, but when it loses,
  it often does so barely. The forces of good within the government, and even within
  individual persons, are much more powerful than the ordinary outsider can imagine. Instead
  of merely opposing the obvious bad, we would be more effective if we would</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">try to support the perhaps not so obvious good. The courageous stand up
  for what they know is right, but they need encouragement, because they often and
  erroneously imagine that they are all alone.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the most courageous of these heros of justice is Congressman Dana
  Rohrabacher (R-CA), who was the key speaker at a Congressional briefing on August 4, 1998,
  introducing the Second International Islamic Unity Conference held the following weekend
  in Washington, D.C. Dana is an intellectual giant, but he was a favorite of Ronald Reagan
  as a speech-writer because he also knows how to speak from the heart, as did the President
  himself. Dana and I crafted words for President Reagan more than a decade ago. The most
  notable speech, the first draft of which Dana Rohrabacher wrote, was given by President
  Reagan in a private meeting on August 3, 1987, to welcome the final report of the
  Presidential Task Force on Economic Justice. This was the first time in half a century
  that any president recognized economic justice as an essential human right, and he did so
  largely in response to the work of Norman Kurland, an enlightened Jew who orchestrated the
  work of like-minded Christians and Muslims.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In this speech, which has remained confidential until now and has never
  been published, President Reagan proclaimed that, &#147;Economic and political freedom are
  inseparably linked.&#148; He concluded, &#147;The founding fathers, Jefferson in
  particular, did not see economic and political freedom as the right only of the citizens
  of the United States, but the right of all people everywhere and for all time.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">As a teenager I worked with the undergrounds of Eastern Europe as a form
  of &#147;field research&#148; for a manual I was preparing on how to overthrow a
  totalitarian state from within. I may be the only person to have escaped twice from
  Stalin&#146;s gulag archipelago or slave-labor camps, and I spent the next twenty years in
  Washington working to overthrow this oppressive economic and political system. The
  horrendous capture of post-Communist Russia by the world&#146;s most brutal mafia, with
  the benign support of an incredibly nave American government, seems to have created an
  economic climate perhaps even worse, at least for the average Russian citizen, than
  Communism at its worst. Small wonder that Zhuganov, the Communist leader, who wants to
  resurrect at least some of oppressive features of the Communist past, is so popular, and
  that the Russian workers blame the United States as the ultimate cause of their
  oppression. Yet American financial, economic, and political advisers seem eager to blame
  anyone and everyone other then themselves. If Russia should undergo a &#147;political
  meltdown,&#148; we should not be surprised if the reaction in Washington will be renewed
  reliance on missiles and weapons of mass destruction in order &#147;to preserve the
  American way of life.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">President Reagan, together with Charles DeGaulle of France and Winston
  Churchill of Great Britain, was one of the twentieth century&#146;s preeminent &#147;grand
  strategists.&#148; He laid the ideological groundwork for his task force on economic
  justice four years earlier on February 22, 1983, in his first major foreign-policy
  pronouncement, the first draft of which was prepared by John Lenczowski, with a couple of
  paragraphs from me. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">His basic thrust was to emphasize our &#147;responsibility to work for
  constructive change, not simply to try to preserve the status quo.&#148;
  &#147;History,&#148; he declared, &#147;is not a darkening path twisting inevitably toward
  tyranny. &#133; It is the growing determination of men and women of all races and
  conditions to gain control of their own destinies.&#148; In this foreign-policy manifesto,
  President Reagan, showed his courage by recognizing the Palestinian nation and asserting
  that satisfaction of this &#147;people&#146;s legitimate rights is a fundamental objective
  of our foreign policy.&#148; </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">President Reagan called American policy-makers, both Republican and
  Democrat, to recognize, as he put it, &#147;the central focus of politics - the minds,
  hearts, sympathies, fear, hopes, and aspirations not of governments, but of people - - the
  global electorate.&#148; He concluded, &#147;The American dream lives - not only in the
  hearts and minds of our own countrymen, but in the hearts and minds of millions of the
  world&#146;s people in both free and oppressed societies who look to us for leadership. As
  long as that dream lives, as long as we continue to defend it, America has a future - and
  all mankind has reason to hope.&#148;</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">In September 1981, President Reagan asked me to be his ambassador to the
  United Arab Emirates with a special mission for peaceful engagement in two-track diplomacy
  with both Muslim governments and Islamist movements. He had just announced a new policy of
  strategic cooperation between Israel and the United States. I took the opportunity to say
  that strategic cooperation between Israel and America could never produce anything of
  lasting value unless it were based on cooperation among the spiritual leaders of the three
  Abrahamic faiths in the Holy Land.</p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">The President was silent for an interminably long time. Then he spoke,
  &#147;You know, I have thought that for a long time, but you are the first person I have
  ever heard say it.&#148; Few people know that after the assassination attempt on his life
  shortly thereafter, President Reagan had a profound spiritual experience, and he told his
  closest associates, perhaps much to the dismay of some, that his only purpose for the rest
  of his life was to be an instrument of God in bringing goodness and peace to the world. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This was why President Reagan shocked the established elites in America by
  calling repeatedly for a &#147;Second American Revolution,&#148; which was nothing other
  than a grand experiment to build a society based on unity in diversity in loving
  submission to Divine Providence. Building such a society, at all the levels of human
  community, is the task of religion in the 21<sup>st</sup> century for all the peoples of
  the world. This task should define the identity of Muslim Americans, as well as Christian
  Americans, and Jewish Americans, and has been a task of all the immigrants over the
  centuries who have come to these shores bringing their traditionalist cultures to enrich
  the universal culture of America. My only caveat to Ronald Reagan&#146;s stated mission is
  that we do not need a Second American Revolution. We need to complete the first one, so
  that America can become what its founders envisioned, namely, the moral leader of the
  world. </p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">This mission is not equivalent to the imperialistic &#147;manifest
  destiny&#148; from which all humankind has suffered. Completing the American revolution is
  another term for Islamizing the world. Islam, in its basic meaning of submission to God
  and to the justice inherent in both natural and revealed law, is the only adequate counter
  to modern terrorism and the only source of stable peace. </p>

Reconsideration</font></font mstheme></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em><font color="#000000">By Shaikh Rashid al Ghanuchi*</font></em></p>
<font SIZE="7">

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">L</font></b>ooking at the Islamic revival worldwide today - a revival
aiming to rebuild the individual and society and recompose the nation's thought and
politics based on Islam - we find it making progress. It is making victories that no other
ideology is making in today's world. The progress is not limited to the idea, because the
idea itself is improving. The Islamic movement has been able to discover new areas of
Islam, and the discoveries continue along the path forged by men of the last century like
Jamal al-Din al-Afghani and continued by men like Hasan al Banna and Abu Al-A'la
al-Maududi. The ideas of these men gave birth to modem Islamic movements, which
rediscovered the Islamic basis upon which to build life. Islam is not a group of
individual beliefs, rituals, or mannerisms. It is a comprehensive way of life. Islam was
around before the modem Islamic movement, but it had been thought of as a preparation for
one to get to heaven, not a system to mold society.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Today Islam is progressing forcefully while secularism is falling
rapidly. While Islam attracts people who are looking for justice, secularism is loosing
major footholds and has lost its ability to defend itself except by violence. When you see
a secular state using more and more violence, know that it is bankrupt. The secular state
has lost its legitimacy. Instead of being based on popular support, these states are based
or international support and on violence. Meanwhile, Islam is progressing vertically and
horizontally. Its idea deepens daily while spreading from fields such as politics and
economics to art, human resource development (including women), and institution-building.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Despite this remarkable progress, however, I must make some negative
remarks, emphasize some shortcomings in the performance of the Islamic movement, and warn
against some pitfalls, because we cannot always focus on the positive side of things.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">One of the elements of repentance is reconsideration. We must
reconsider our actions every day. Are we really on the truth path, or can we be described
by the Qur'anic verse: <i><b>&quot;We found our forefathers doing some-thing and here we
are doing the same&quot;</b></i> (Zukhruf: 23). This verse was intended to describe the
polytheists, but Muslims should learn to understand the meaning of continuous evaluation.
So repentance is not some-thing limited to our relationship to God; it includes
reconsideration of the self at every step in life. This is why self-criticism is so
important. The Prophet (PBUH) says, <i><b>&quot;Hold yourself accountable before you are
held accountable.&quot;</b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">It is imperative that every movement correct its performance. It should
ask: is our plan fulfilled? Why were we late in fulfilling it? What can we do to avoid
delays next time? If a movement has 20 members in the parliament in one election, and five
in the next, shouldn't it ask why? If the state has conspired against us, why and how?
Such a movement should not get angry because we ask that it re-evaluate itself. We have
performed such re-evaluations in our movement, and were able to put our finger on a number
of mistakes that we made in dealing with the regime in our country.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What I am proposing is a group of comments that have a lot of room for
personal interpretation. Some might agree, disagree, or partially disagree.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first comment is about the strategy of the Islamic movement in
dealing with minorities. Muslim minorities are 45 percent of the entire world population
of Muslims. They are a major value for Islam, and they are the pioneers of Islamic
propagation. Either they help open the path or else they become extinct. Supporting these
outlying regions must be a priority before extinction. Look at what happened in the Balkan
region. In the days of the Ottomans, the spread of Islam was rapid. After the demise of
the Caliphate, the Islamic presence there is like puddles of water where the sea has left,
waiting to dry out.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The balance of international power is not on the side of these
minorities. They should not have to over-extend their resources and carry the burden of
Islamic governance. This is a role for the countries with a Muslim majority. If these
Muslim minorities adopt the ideas of Islamic governance laid out by Sayyed Qutub and
others at this point, they will have signed their own death warrant.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The role I suggest for Muslim minorities is to reinforce the Islamic
presence in the countries they live in. There is a big difference between maintaining a
presence and working to establish an Islamic government. The most a minority can hope for
is participation in politics. In fact, their entry into the realm of politics is sometimes
a major reason for the attention minorities get. So they better focus on social work.
Politics is a grinding arena. The race for government is the race for wealth and
influence.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Sometimes we find Muslim minorities asking for independence or a
separate state. Of course this is allowed from a legal point of view, but in reality it
must not be allowed. We can ask: is the request for independence necessary? Or can we
except a lesser arrangement,<sub> </sub>like self-rule, in preparation for the return to
Islam? This goes for the Chechnyans, where the Muslim minority is demanding independence
from Russia. Russia is a decaying empire; Islam can get to it in time. So why should we
prevent that by splitting from it especially if independence is simply not viable and
would lead to the annihilation of the Muslim minority? Also, the incessant demand for
independence might damage the relationship between the Muslim world and the nation that
the Muslim minority wants independence from. If the Muslim minority in China adopts the
demand for independence one day, and the Muslims find an interest in allying with China
against some mutual enemy, the Muslims will be faced with a major dilemma.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic nation has an interest in not picking fights with China,
India, or even Yugoslavia these days. Wherever Muslim minorities can live safely, and
practice their religious rites freely, independence is not necessary. In fact, the pursuit
of independence could be deadly. Generally speaking, Muslim minorities are not requested
to govern the countries they live in by Islam, nor to think about independence, because
this will lead to their genocide and put the entire Islamic nation's interests in danger.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The second comment is about priorities. Is our priority social work or
reaching power? These two items might not be mutually exclusive -Islam wants to Islamize
politics and society simultaneously - but if the interests of social missionary work
(da'wa) contradicts political interests, the social interests must be put before anything
else. It has been proven that what is achieved socially is more permanent and better than
what is achieved politically.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Modern experience has taught us that things achieved through the state
are quick but short-lived, because they depend on force. But what is done through social
activity lasts, because it depends on persuasion. Humans do not like to be forced. The
Meccans offered Muhammad (PBUH) the government but he refused it, preferring instead to
establish his calling.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic movement must not have the government as its first
priority. Takeover of government should not be the biggest achievement possible. A bigger
achievement would be if the people would love Islam and its leaders. Our entire activity
is based on the Islamic state of Umar ibn Abdul Aziz, which lasted only for two years, and
the Guided Caliphate before him. Who remembers anything from the Umayyad or Abbassid
caliphates? Umar ibn Abdul Aziz was a beacon because he renewed the prophetic form of
government. The issue is not how long you governed, but what you did. The years of Umar
left a long-lasting effect in the hearts of Muslims for the rest of history. The most
dangerous thing is for the Islamists to be loved by the people before they get to power
and then hated afterward.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The third comment deals with civil society. The Islamic movement should
be keen on developing and strengthening civil society even after the state is established.
Even the Islamic state doesn't have control over everything under it. Government is a
small part of the institutions of civil society It is there to support and strengthen
society. There must be more institutions of civil society, enough so that the people don't
need the state. The Islamic movement must return power to the society through grassroots
institutions. These institutions must be led by elected officials.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">There shouldn't be institutions exclusively for Islamists. It's better
to have nationwide institutions where everyone competes for their leadership. It is a
waste of time to have a leftist student organization, an Islamic student organization,
etc. The Islamic movement should not be an excuse to divide the people. All are Muslims,
but the Islam of some needs a little rejuvenation. Even the idea of Islamic parties should
be given up. While the word &quot;Islamic&quot; usually is prohibited for political
reasons from being in the name of Islamic parties, that might actually be a blessing. Any
party that the Islamists participate in must be an open, national party.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fourth comment is on the current conflict between the Islamic
movement and the secular state. The movement is being subjected to horrific mounts of
violence and suppression. The question is: how should the movement respond to oppression
by the secular state? Is state violence a justification for popular violence? There are
many religious replies to this question; most do not condone violence against a government
that calls itself Islamic. Pragmatically speaking, however, all of the episodes where
Islamists are responded violently to state violence have been negative. Popular violence,
whether Islamic or otherwise, has not been able to damage any regime's standing. Leftists
and Islamists have carried out violence, and it has led to nothing but disaster, as in
Syria.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamic movement must abide by peaceful methods. It must refuse all
forms of military activity. This is the lesson we can learn from the Rafah Party in
Turkey. The achievements of the Islamic movement were confiscated more than once by the
military. Had the Islamists called for revolution against the army, it would have been
utter stupidity and it would have been a catastrophe. Today the Islamic movement in Egypt
suffers from hard times, but its leaders refuse to be misled into violence. These regimes
want the Islamists to enter the fighting arena, because the government has more resources.
Violence is what these regimes specialize in, and they are rather creative at it. The
arena of the Islamists is thought, and that is where the rulers are bankrupt. We should
not be pulled into a field where they will surely win.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The fifth comment deals with democracy. Many Islamists associate
democracy with foreign intervention and non-belief. But democracy is a set of mechanisms
to guarantee freedom of thought and assembly and peaceful competition for governmental
authority through ballot boxes. The Islamic movement's negative attitude toward democracy
is holding it back. We have no modern experience in Islamic activity that can replace
democracy. The Islamization of democracy is the closest thing to implementing shura
(consultation). Those who reject this thought have not produced anything different than
the one-party system of rule.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Islamists have two examples: Iran and Sudan. Both are searching for
identity searching for a modern Islamic form of government. We have no modern example for
implementing Islamic government. The uneducated think that the Islamic programme is a
ready-made entity: stick it on the ground and implement it. I don't see any choice before
us but to adapt the democratic idea. It might even be dangerous to ignore democracy. Even
more dangerous is for the Islamic movement to reach a state where either it remains in
power or it dissipates. The movement's options must be open to guarantee its existence.
The ones who can gain the most from democracy are the Muslims; they should be the keenest
for it. They might come to power whenever free elections are held. The secularists are in
the minority these days. They are the ones who have problems with democracy. They are
preventing democracy in the Islamic world, because they would lose.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We must work to lessen the conflicts between the Islamic trend and
other political trends in the Muslim world. May God help us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As national barriers give way to globalism, America will have to brace for
the fourth transformation to a more inclusive America. When our Founding Fathers declared
&#147;All Men Are Created Equal&#148;, little did they know how much pain their
ideological progenies would endure to win legitimacy for the absoluteness of the
&#147;All&#148;. For two centuries, the American ideology would be put to the test. And
with much pain and sorrow, at each transformation, the circle of inclusion would be
stretched further. But why can&#146;t America move forward at will and without the
foot-dragging? This is the American Paradox that continues to confound us today. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Tragically, no less than two dozen victims of exclusion languish in
American jails today for all the wrong reasons and are being denied the due process most
Americans take for granted. Those human beings America unjustly deemed
&#147;undesirable&#148; are stripped of their human rights and are condemned by America to
the margins of freedom. Hundreds of thousands more are judged &#147;suspect&#148; and
continue to live with the gradual erosion of their civil liberties and potentially their
freedoms, too. On closer inspection, those people are primarily of the Muslim faith. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obviously, America has yet to deliver one more time on its mission of
inclusion. Not unlike the early outcasts&#151;the American revolutionaries and the African
slaves&#151;Muslims in America found their guardians, too. Historically, those guardians
were the constitutional police and the challengers of the status quo preceding each
American revolution. They are initially disdained by the mainstream, and their views
barely tolerated. Nevertheless, the undesirables and their guardians were always sent to
remind us, as in the past, that our American journey is not over yet. Their presence
amongst us today is a sign for America to start moving forward again. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">American Theory, UN-American Practices</b></u><br>
The American ideology was so ahead of its time even its early messengers were unable to
embody the uncompromising moral principles or foresee the enormity of its impact on the
future of mankind. Nowhere else did the followers outperform the prophets than in America.
If our Founding Fathers were present today, they would marvel at their ideological
descendants&#146; genius. We have succeeded where they seemed to have faltered. And if we
were to return back in time, we would be condemned as delusional if we offered a glimpse
of the future (our present) to our predecessors. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While ideological revolutions tend to peak at the start and taper off with
the coming decades, the American ideological revolution took two centuries in its search
for greatness. When juxtaposed with its past, America today bares little resemblance to
its unrefined ways of earlier decades. The transformation is startling. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America had a peculiar love-hate relationship with its guiding principle,
the Constitution. Americans fought hard to be included and they fought hard to exclude.
Today, the American umbrella of opportunity and civil liberties is more inclusive than
ever, but we still fall short of the ideal we committed to in our seventeenth century
Covenant. It took three revolutions to bring America to where it is today. But one final
correction remains to be made and it may take a fourth revolution to widen the umbrella of
liberty and opportunity in this global village. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the absence of our Founding Fathers&#146; guidance, the Guardians of
the Covenant today are the visionary radicals, constitutional purists, today&#146;s
ideological mavericks, and tomorrow&#146;s engineers of the new mainstream. Some are
victims of the status quo and have little to lose in undermining it, but most break off
from the mainstream. No one knows how they are chosen, but every American revolution found
its honourable rebels. Their most potent weapon is the chasm America often creates between
the status quo and the ideals we had committed to. With each American revolution, that
weapon proved the most potent of all. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first American revolution gave us our independence from tyranny and
oppression. Those radical revolutionaries were the first Guardians of the Covenant to
undermine the status quo and set the stage for our nation&#146;s birth. They were dubbed
traitors and rabble-rousers. In the end, they did prevail and America was born. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the Civil War, the second American revolution commenced. Years
before, &#147;radicals&#148; began to hammer at the edges of a complacent America calling
for the end of slavery. With time, the anti-slavery minority became the majority and the
institution of slavery crumbled. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The third American revolution was brewing in the south. The guardians were
already plotting against the status quo. When it was over in third America, no one was to
be denied life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. Another key pillar of our Covenant
was upheld and the stage was set for the fourth and final American revolution. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The incongruities between the practices of the Framers of the Constitution
and the wording of the Constitution raises some interesting observations as to the power
of the human spirit and its ability to transcend its material surroundings and
limitations. The Declaration of Independence and the Constitution were a clear-cut
indictment of the American culture of exclusion then and until the Civil Rights movement
began to bear some fruits. The American journey to greatness proves three points: America
is not capable of tolerating disparities between ideals and practices for too long;
America is capable of transcending its limitations; and when America is given a choice
between abandoning ideals or abandoning a comfortable status quo and unfair privileges,
America chooses the ideals. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What motivates great men such as Thomas Jefferson to set in motion the
dynamics of social and political reforms that one day would undermine the comfortable
status quo? Foresight or divine intervention? Maybe both. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Fourth Revolution </b></u><br>
Today, the final challenge has arrived. Who will unite America with its ideals once and
for all and bring the centuries-old journey to closure? Who will be first to dissolve the
status quo, turn the mainstream upside-down, and draw the final boundaries of the new
mainstream in accordance with America&#146;s global responsibility and moral authority? In
this era of great American triumphs, one would expect an America at peace with itself to
be an America ready to deliver on more promises. No American generation has the right to
stop the journey forward. Ours not excepted. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sadly, with no Evil Empires to train our nuclear guns at, America turned
its attention to windmills. We have secured our peace in the world and our place in
history but chose to deny others the right to their peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of lighting beacons of liberty, we chose free trade and petty
parochial interests. In a world which stood patiently waiting for America to beat the bear
hoping we would turn our attention to their plight, America has yet to deliver. Today, we
stand in the way between the underdogs and their dreams of liberty. Worse yet, we are
actively aborting campaigns of freedom while propping up tyranny and oppression. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Locked behind steels bars in America are the avant-garde of liberty in the
Third World. They are the enemies of the status quo where tyranny and oppression have
struck roots. Predictably, the American mainstream today is preserving a global status quo
that is not essential to our livelihood, but comes at a great cost to the lives of
hundreds of millions around the world. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">America must not continue to arbitrarily draw a line in the sand as to who
is worthy of our Constitutional umbrella and who is less worthy. This arbitrary exclusion
is reminiscent of our betrayal of native Americans, African Americans, Asian Americans,
and other people America deemed marginal at one point. Their only fault? they looked or
acted different.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the Muslims of America are enduring what amounts to a systematic
dehumanizing campaign so successful even special laws were crafted by our Congress to
&#147;deal&#148; with these undesirables. From the FAA&#146;s Airport Passenger Profiling
to the FBI&#146;s and INS&#146;s &#147;secret evidence&#148; practices, the boldness of
these exclusionary laws and procedures must shock decent Americans into action. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a display of gross injustice, these Muslims are barred by our laws from
sharing the American ideals of liberty and justice with their countrymen across the
oceans. Why? It is bad for the status quo. As a result, millions of Muslims languish under
occupation, tyranny and oppression around the world. And when Muslims who sought sanctuary
in America hoist the banner of liberty and spread American ideals, they end up behind
bars, in America. If you, too, see the disconnect between the ideals and the practices,
then you have guessed correctly. This is a sign of another American transformation in the
making. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Are we ready to declare the status quo null and void again? If we are
fortunate enough, absolute and universal justice will be fashioned in our lifetime and the
transformation will be a tranquil one. It is up to America to expedite the final journey
towards fulfilling its elusive promise. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let us remember that in the age of nations, America is an adolescent
nation. We are still witnesses to an America in its formative years. It is too early to
judge us by our trials and errors. Let us be judged by our will to surmount our weaknesses
and how far we have come. </p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Ruth Anderson</i><font SIZE="5"></p>
</font></b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The negative image of Muslims and Islam began as early as the Crusades
when Christian and mercenary soldiers marched to Palestine in order to &#147;free&#148;
Jerusalem and the Holy Land from Islamic influence and authority. Songs were then sung by
marching Crusaders characterizing Islam and Muslims not only negatively but Muslims as
infidels and idolaters. Ever since the early Crusades, Islam and Muslims have been
portrayed in a derogatory fashion. But the ushering in of the twentieth century brought a
more energetic and concerted effort to demonize Arabs and Muslims so that European and
American Jews could swarm in and invade Palestine after World War I and II, and occupy a
country not theirs with the blessings and support of the British and American governments.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">With the declaration of the Jewish state of Israel at the expense of
the Palestinians in 1948, there has been a continuing, sometimes covert, oftentimes
obvious and blatant effort to stereotype Arabs and Muslims as barbaric terrorists
possessing no conscience or mercy in their war against the civilized populations of the
world. This negative stereotyping is a Zionist ploy to further its gains whether in the
remnants of Palestine itself or through the savage merciless bombing of the Iraqi people.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As a typical American child, I was exposed to, and grew up on an
overdose of Nazi war films and the exodus image of thousands of homeless Jews helplessly
and innocently migrating back to their &#147;homeland.&#148; At that time, I had no
inkling whatsoever that Palestine was indeed not their homeland in any way and that the
land they were migrating to with the aid of the British and Americans was already
populated by its indigenous inhabitants who had dwelled there for more than 2000 years.
The Diaspora, once Jewish, now is Palestinian and the greater portion of Palestinians
today live in exile outside the boundaries of their own country. The continuing occupation
of Palestine and the fait accompli establishment of the Jewish state is a prime example of
propaganda at its best.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Novels and encyclopedic information either subtly and shrewdly or
manifestly insert defamatory statements about Arabs and Muslims in such a way that the
reader is unaware of these attacks. The American film industry is even more effective in
the portrayal of Arabs and Muslims in a manner that creates hate and prejudice in the
hearts and minds of international viewers. Arab and Muslim groups living within the United
States have struggled to combat these negative images but do not have hardly any power nor
as effective a voice as the billions of dollars that back the entertainment industry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A United Nations special investigator on religion, a Tunisian lawyer,
Abdul Fattah Amor, said on March 17, that a pervasive Islamophobia exists in the United
States and is fed by a &#147;hate-filled image of Muslims presented in the media. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Amor, who compiled his report after a visit to the United States in
January and February of this year, argued that &#147;The Muslim community can certainly
flourish freely in the religious sphere, but it has to be recognized that there is an
Islamophobia reflecting both racial and religious intolerance.&#148; He went on to say,
&#147;This is not the fault of the authorities, but of a very harmful activity by the
media in general and the popular press in particular, which consists in putting out a
distorted and indeed hate-filled message treating Muslims as extremists and
terrorists.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">As the intellectual Edward Said, who is a renowned Palestinian
American, pointed out in a recent article about America&#146;s ongoing genocide against
the Iraqi people: ..&#147;First of all, there is a long, relatively uninterrupted
tradition in American History of exterminating without mercy people who are considered to
be savages and demons. This starts with the native American peoples, 90 percent of whom
were massacred during the first two centuries of this country&#146;s (America) life, all
in the name of progress, doing God&#146;s work and eradicating barbarians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">According to the great Muslim thinker, Muhammed Kutub, the best way to
counteract hostility to Islam and Muslims is through faith. Faith is what let early
Muslims win battles against impossible odds such as 300 to 1. If was the faith of the
early Muslim warriors that defeated the more politically sophisticated and better equipped
Roman Empire and also the Persian Empire. Then, a Muslim soldier entered any battle with
the idea that he would either die a martyr or win a victory.</p>

<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">It is sad that some of the
  greatest enemies of Islam can be found in the dictators of Muslims countries. Examples of
  the so-called Muslim leaders who want a secular state at the expense of the lives and
  welfare of their people can be found in Algeria and Turkey. The day to day massacres of
  Algerian civilians are not carried out by true Muslims, but by paid mercenaries wishing to
  turn the hearts of the people against Islam. There are many other leaders of Muslim
  countries whose prisons are full of those wishing to promote Islam and Islamic
  governments.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The best solution to the stagnation of the current Muslim Ummah
(nation) and Islamophobia itself, is to apply true Islamic principles based on the Koran
and Hadith. A Western or secular approach will not solve the current crisis, but a
solution can be found with new and brave ideas, regardless of their source as long as they
follow and adhere to Islamic principles. Imitating foreign cultures and ideas will
accomplish nothing if they are un-Islamic. However any effort cannot function or survive
without the support and money of rich Arab and Muslim countries. It is tragic and
unfortunate however that most of the leaders of Arab and Muslim countries are corrupt,
power-hungry and anti-Islamic themselves.</p>

</font>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">Part 14</p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Israel Shahak</i></b><font SIZE="4"></p>
</font>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As explained before, the Halakhah, that is the legal system of classical
Judaism - as practised by virtually all Jews from the 9<sup>th</sup> century to the end of
the 18<sup>th</sup> and as maintained to this very day in the form of Orthodox Judaism -
is based primarily on the Babylonian Talmud. However, because of the unwieldy complexity
of the legal disputations recorded in the Talmud, more manageable codifications of
talmudic law became necessary and were indeed compiled by successive generations of
rabbinical scholars. Some of these have acquired great authority and are in general use.
For this reason we shall refer for the most part to such compilations (and their most
reputable commentaries) rather than directly to the Talmud. It is however correct to
assume that the compilation referred to reproduces faithfully the meaning of the talmudic
text and the additions made by later scholars on the basis of that meaning.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The earliest code of talmudic law which is still of major importance is
the <i>Mishneh Torah </i>written by Moses Maimonides in the late 12<sup>th</sup> century.
The most authoritative code, widely used to date as a handbook, is the <i>Shulhan
&#145;Arukh </i>composed by R. Yosef Karo in the late 16<sup>th</sup> century as a popular
condensation of his own much more voluminous <i>Beyt Yosef </i>which was intended for the
advanced scholar. The <i>Shulhan &#145;Arukh </i>is much commented uupon; in addition to
classical commentaries dating from the 17<sup>th</sup> century, there is an important 20<sup>th</sup>
century one, <i>Mishnah Berurah. </i>Finally, the <i>Talmudic Encyclopedia </i>- a modern
compilation published in Israel from the 1950s and edited by the country&#146;s greatest
Orthodox rabbinical scholars - is a good compendium of the whole talmudic literature.</p>
<font FACE="Arial"><u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Murder and Genocide</b></i></u></font><br>
According to the Jewish religion, the murder of a Jew is a capital offence and one of the
three most heinous sins (the other two being idolatry and adultery). Jewish religious
courts and secular authorities are commanded to punish, even beyond the limits of the
ordinary administration of justice, anyone guilty of murdering a Jew. A Jew who indirectly
causes the death of another Jew is, however, only guilty of what talmudic law calls a sin
against the &#145;laws of Heaven&#146;, to be punished by God rather than by man.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When the victim is a Gentile, the position is quite different. A Jew
who murders a Gentile is guilty only of a sin against the laws of Heaven, not punishable
by a court.<sup> </sup>To cause indirectly the death of a Gentile is no sin at all.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Thus, one of the two most important commentators on the <i>Shulhan
&#145;Arukh </i>explains that when it comes to a Gentile, &#145;one must not lift
one&#146;s hand to harm him, but one may harm him indirectly, for instance by removing a
ladder after he had fallen into a crevice ... there is no prohibition here, because it was
not done directly.<sup> </sup>He points out, however, that an act leading indirectly to a
Gentile&#146;s death is forbidden if it may cause the spread of hostility towards Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">A Gentile murderer who happens to be under Jewish jurisdiction must be
executed whether the victim was Jewish or not. However, if the victim was Gentile and the
murderer converts to Judaism, he is not punished.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">All this has a direct and practical relevance to the realities of the
State of Israel. Although the state&#146;s criminal laws make no distinction between Jew
and Gentile, such distinction is certainly made by Orthodox rabbis, who in guiding their
flock follow the Halakhah. Of special importance is the advice they give to religious
soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Since even the minimal interdiction against murdering a Gentile
outright applies only to &#145;Gentiles with whom we [the Jews] are not at war&#146;,
various rabbinical commentators in the past drew the logical conclusion that in wartime
all Gentiles belonging to a hostile population may, or even should be killed.<sup> </sup>Since
1973, this doctrine is being publicly propagated for the guidance of religious Israeli
soldiers. The first such official exhortation was included in a booklet published by the
Central Region Command of the Israeli Army, whose area includes the West Bank. In this
booklet the Command&#146;s Chief Chaplain writes:</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">When our forces come across civilians during a war or in hot pursuit or
in a raid, so long as there is no certainty that those civilians are incapable of harming
our forces, then according to the Halakhah, they may and even should be killed ... Under
no circumstances should an Arab be trusted, even if he makes an impression of being
civilised ... In war, when our forces storm the enemy, they are allowed and even enjoined
by the Halakhah to kill even good civilians, that is, civilians who are ostensibly good.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The same doctrine is expounded in the following exchange of letters
between a young Israeli soldier and his rabbi, published in the yearbook of one of the
country&#146;s most prestigious religious colleges, Midrashiyyat No&#146;am, where many
leaders and activists of the National Religious Party and Gush Emunim have been educated.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Letter from the soldier Moshe to Rabbi Shim&#146;on Weiser</b></i><br>
&#145;With God&#146;s help, to His Honour, my dear Rabbi,</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;First I would like to ask how you and your family are. I hope all
is well. I am, thank God, feeling well. A long time I have not written. Please forgive me.
Sometimes I recall the verse &#147;when shall I come and appear before God?&#148; I hope,
without being certain, that I shall come during one of the leaves. I must do so.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">In one of the discussions in our group, there was a debate about the
&#147;purity of weapons&#148; and we discussed whether it is permitted to kill unarmed men
- or women and children. Or perhaps we should take revenge on the Arabs? And then everyone
answered according to his own understanding. I could not arrive at a clear decision,
whether Arabs should be treated like the Amalekites, meaning that one is permitted to
murder [sic]<i> </i>them until their remembrance is blotted out from under heaven,<sup> </sup>or
perhaps one should do as in a just war, in which one kills only the soldiers.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;A second problem I have is whether I am permitted to put myself
in danger by allowing a woman to stay alive? For there have been cases when women threw
hand grenades. Or am I permitted to give water to an Arab who put his hand up? For there
may be reason to fear that he only means to deceive me and will kill me, and such things
have happened.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;I conclude with a warm greeting to the rabbi and all his family.
-<i>Moshe.&#146;</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reply of R. Shim&#146;on Weiser to Moshe</b></i><br>
&#145;With the help of Heaven. Dear Moshe, Greetings.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am starting this letter this evening although I know I cannot finish
it this evening, both because I am busy and because I would like to make it a long letter,
to answer your questions in full, for which purpose I shall have to copy out some of the
sayings of our sages, of blessed memory, and interpret them.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The non-Jewish nations have a custom according to which war has its own
rules, like those of a game, like the rules of football or basketball. But according to
the sayings of our sages, of blessed memory, [...] war for us is not a game but a vital
necessity, and only by this standard must we decide how to wage it. On the one hand [...]
we seem to learn that if a Jew murders a Gentile, he is regarded as a murderer and, except
for the fact that no court has the right to punish him, the gravity of the deed is like
that of any other murder. But we find in the very same authorities in another place
[&#133;] that Rabbi Shim&#146;on used t say: &#147;The best of Gentiles - kill him; the
best of snakes - dash out its brains.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;It might perhaps be argued that the expression &#147;kill&#148;
in the saying of R. Shim&#146;on is only figurative and should not be taken literally but
as meaning &#147;oppress&#148; or some similar attitude, and this way we also avoid a
contradiction with the authorities quoted earlier. Or one might argue that this saying,
though meant literally, is [merely] his own personal opinion, disputed by other sages
[quoted earlier]. But we find the true explanation in the Tosafot. There [...] we learn
the following comment on talmudic pronouncement that Gentiles who fall into a well should
not be helped out, but neither should they be pushed into the well to be killed, which
means that they should neither be saved from death nor killed directly. And the Tosafot
write as follow &#147;And if it is queried [because] in another place it was said <i>The</i>
<i>best of Gentiles - kill him, </i>then the answer is that this [saying] is meant for
wartime.&#148; [&#133;]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;According to the commentators of the Tosafot, a distinction must
be made between wartime and peace, so that although during peace time it is forbidden to
kill Gentiles, in a case occurs in wartime it is a <i>mitzvah </i>[imperative, religious
duty] to kill them. [&#133;]</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;And this is the difference between a Jew and a Gentile: although
the rule &#147;whoever comes to kill you, kill him first&#148; applies to a Jew, as was
said in Tractate <i>Sanhedrin </i>[of the Talmud], page 72a, still it only applies to him
if there is [actual] ground to fear that he is coming to kill you. But a Gentile during
wartime is usual to be presumed so, except when it is quite clear that he has no evil
intent. This is the rule of &#147;purity of weapons&#148; according the Halakhah - and not
the alien conception which is now accepted in the Israeli army and which has been the
cause of many [Jewish] casualties. I enclose a newspaper cutting with the speech made last
week in the Knesset by Rabbi Kalman Kahana, which shows in a very lifelike - and also
painful - way how the &#147;purity of weapons&#148; has caused deaths.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;I conclude here, hoping that you will not find the length of this
letter irksome. This subject was being discussed even without your letter, but your letter
caused me to write up the whole matter.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;Be in peace, you and all Jews, and [I hope to] see you soon, as
you<b> </b>say, Yours &#150; <i>Shim&#146;on.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Reply of Moshe to R. Shim&#146;on Weiser </b></i><br>
&#145;To His Honour, my dear Rabbi, </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;First I hope that you and your family are in health and are all
right.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;I have received your long letter and am grateful for your
personal watch over me, for I assume that you write to many, and most of your time is
taken up with your studies in your own programme.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;Therefore my thanks to you are doubly deep.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;As for the letter itself, I have understood it as follows:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">&#145;In wartime I am not merely permitted, but enjoined to kill every
  Arab man and woman whom I chance upon, if there is reason to fear that they help in the
  war against us, directly or indirectly. </p>
  <p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">And as far as I am concerned I have to kill them even if that might
  result in an involvement with the military law. I think that this matter of the purity of
  weapons should be transmitted to educational institutions, at least the religious ones, so
  that they should have a position about this subject and so that they will not wander in
  the broad fields of &#147;logic&#148;, especially on this subject; and the rule has to be
  explained as it should be followed in practice. For, I am sorry to say, I have seen
  different types of &#147;logic&#148; here even among the religious comrades. I do hope
  that you shall be active in this, so that our boys will know the line of their ancestors
  clearly and unambiguously.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I conclude here, hoping that when the [training] course ends, in bout a
month, I shall be able to come to the yeshivah [talmudic college]. Greetings - <i>Moshe.</i></p>

<p>Of course, this doctrine of the Halakhah on murder clashes, in principle, not only with
Israel&#146;s criminal law, but also - as hinted in the letters just quoted - with
official military standing regulations. However, there can be little doubt that in
practice this doctrine does exert an influence on the administration of justice,
especially by military authorities. The fact is that in all cases where Jews have, in a
military or paramilitary context, murdered Arab non-combatants- including cases of mass
murder such as that in Kafr Qasim in 1956 - the murderers, if not let off altogether,
received extremely light sentences or won far-reaching remissions, reducing their
punishment to next to nothing.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#CC3333" mstheme><font color="#FF0000">Why This Delay In Kosovo?</font></font mstheme></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="CENTER">By Fatima Hamilton*</i></p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"><font color="#0000FF">Editor&#146;s note:</font> </b>This article was
written before NATO began strikes against the Serbs</i></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">At this moment in time, we find a distinct contradiction in UN and NATO
policies: on the one hand America is striking Iraq daily while on the other hand they
delay striking the Serbs. Why the delay? Why the double-standard? Both the Serbs and
Saddam&#151;according to the words and descriptions of Western powers&#151;are alike. So
why then do they favour one over the other? This favouritism is very distinct. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">U.S. Foreign Secretary Madeline Albright stated that if the Serbs did
not agree to the peace deal, then NATO would strike them. Then, NATO went back on their
word. The Serbs did not agree and are still disagreeing. Yet, the time for the peace talks
was extended, more than once. Had it been Iraq or any other Arab or Muslim country, then
the U.S. would have already struck them with all that they possess. Yet, they delay, as
they did with Bosnia in the past, while innocent civilians are being killed. They are, in
a sense, buying time for the Serbs. While NATO plays around in these hopeless peace talks,
the Serbs are extending their territory. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Serbs are preparing for a U.S.-led air strike, so they&#146;ve been
clearing out homes and the area around the buffer zone between Southern Kosovo and
Macedonia. They sent thousands of troops there and they&#146;ve wired one of the main
tunnels between the two countries with explosives in the expectation that NATO will use
this tunnel. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can see the Serbs really don&#146;t want peace&#151;at least their
government doesn&#146;t. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">We can compare the Serbs to Iraq, but in the end we find they have done
worse than Iraq ever did. Yet, they get to go free while Iraq gets punished. Iraq
hasn&#146;t gone outside of its borders for the past 10 years. They have complied with
UNSCOM rules until it hurt them so bad economically and their children died and suffered
from illness and malnutrition&#151;and still are. Then they finally pleaded for sanctions
to be lifted. However, the West, in particular the U.S., refused and placed more and more
conditions on it. Then, when Iraq could bear no more of the inhumane treatment and decided
to deny UNSCOM to continue its work, they got punished again. And still, for no reason
except a brute show of force from America to show the world who&#146;s the boss, we find
America striking Iraq daily. This is unfair and inhumane. The Iraqi people&#151;children,
women and other civilians&#151;are suffering. America and NATO have set a double-standard
that says &#145;your lives are worthless&#146;. They strike at them, and yet they
won&#146;t strike at the Serbian criminals? Well, they have also devalued the lives of the
people of Kosovo because they have delayed striking at a racist Serbian enemy while
allowing the Serbs the freedom to continue destroying the people of Kosovo. The
ethnic-Albanians have the right to defend themselves. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Maybe the U.S. wants to keep Serbian sovereignty intact. How is this
fair if they don&#146;t allow Iraq to have its own sovereignty due to imposing the no-fly
zones that take up most of Iraq&#146;s territory? These no-fly zones have been imposed for
years. So, when will they be lifted? Will they ever be lifted? Who will end up with these
areas of Iraq? Will they be divided among Western powers? Didn&#146;t this kind of
imperialism disappear and become &#147;out of style&#148;? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. gets to be an aggressor in Iraq, and NATO does not stop them.
The Serbs get to be an aggressor in Kosovo and in Macedonia, and still Bosnia is at risk,
while NATO does nothing to stop this. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">What good are NATO and the UN if they cannot put down aggression and
enforce peace? One must realize that sometimes peace can be achieved diplomatically while
at other times it must be enforced with a strong hand. So, where&#146;s this strong hand
in Kosovo? Will NATO wait until the Serbs have wiped out the Albanian population? Will
they wait so long that Macedonia ends up becoming a part of greater Serbia? The UN and
NATO should really think about their role in the world and stop allowing the U.S. to
always be its voice and leader. Aren&#146;t they supposed to be equal partners? </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The U.S. now rules the world&#151;politically and economically.
Isn&#146;t it wonderful to have a criminal country for a world leader while professing to
believe in and to be working for peace and justice? This criminal country strikes at
innocent countries such as Sudan and Afghanistan; it imposes unfair sanctions on countries
such as Libya and Iraq to destroy their economies and their people; it bullies other
countries to get them to do whatever they want; and it practices racism and sexism (not to
mention sex scandals) within its own borders. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">No wonder the problem isn&#146;t getting solved in Kosovo! No wonder
the world is upside-down now! Look who&#146;s really running it!</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">I am a Palestinian writer and poet who is being held in an Israeli
prison somewhere in the desert. I have been told that my &#147;crime&#148; flows from the
ink of my pen and if you have ever heard the expression, &#147;the pen is mightier than
the sword,&#148; it must be true, for the Israelis apparently think my words are a threat
to all their power, their money, their weapons and the backing of their greatest friends,
the Americans.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My first name is Taha but in order to make me nothing more than a
statistic, I have been given the number 39. My fellow inmates are writers too. We all
share the guilt of trying to form a link with our Israeli counterparts who also write what
they believe in.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Under the blistering sun of the desert, the burning sand is my bed and
the prison camp I dwell in is an extermination camp, which exterminates all that is human
in Man. If Hell exists, this prison would be its main gate of entry.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Let me make it clear that I am not a terrorist. I have never bombed
anyone nor in any way taken a human life. I have never even struck anyone in anger. I only
write for the freedom of my country and for the human rights entitled to all mankind. </p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My inmates and I live on crumbs of bread, bits of butter and jam and
tiny portions of beans and warm water. Worms, snakes and scorpions share our foul beds
with us. For over 60 days we have not been allowed to change our clothes. Whenever we
suffer from intense pain, we go to the doctor. He only prescribes for us water and an herb
that eases nothing. Since my only crime is being a freedom writer and hence, a warrior
poet, I somehow derive strength from this charge.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">My words have more influence than the Uzi submachine gun. Some of my
Israeli counterparts who write the truth understand the need to reach a comprehensive
peace agreement, one that will ensure the future of both Palestinian and Israeli children
and one that will ensure the future of the region as a whole. So far, the Oslo Accords and
the Wye Agreement have not ensured anything at all. It is obvious that any progressive
culture whether Israeli or Western, cannot flourish in the shadow of violence and the
violation of human rights. The slogan that my fellow inmates and I have put forward is
culture versus racism and an end to all occupation of Palestinian land.</p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Yet, the champions of racism and those who would kill all that is human
in Man have attacked me and my fellow inmates, have shut down our progressive press and
intensified censorship restrictions. There are about 15 of us, writers and poets living in
tragic conditions which run counter to basic human values. </p>

<blockquote>
  <font SIZE="2"><p ALIGN="JUSTIFY"></font><font size="3">Arabs have been famous for their
  poetry and their writing abilities even before the advent of Islam. In fact, the Holy
  Koran is the most beautiful poetry ever written. Though I am imprisoned in the desert and
  in spite of the blistering heat, the ink in my pen will not dry up. I will continue to
  write for the sake of justice and peace, for the sake of a smile on a child&#146;s lips. I
  will continue to write so no tear will fall from a child&#146;s eye for a slain brother or
  father and I will always write to express my true aspirations. I will continue to write so
  that one day I can see Yitzhak and Ahmed playing together rather than see Yitzhak leading
  Ahmed to prison in the middle of the night. I and my fellow writers are in prison while
  our Israeli counterparts are free. Through the bars of my prison window, I see the same
  stars that our Israeli counterparts see, and the same moon shines down on us all. </font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The value of any writer is not judged by the quantity of his work but
by his humanity. Though I have been beaten for my words, wounded and placed in solitary
confinement, my faith in God lives on and one day the freedom I seek will find me, either
in this life or in death. I am a Warrior Poet and with my pen I fight for the freedom of
my people.</p>
