<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">A Palestinian strategy to counter Sharon&#146;s
Apartheid</font></strong><em><b></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</b></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If opinion polls hold true, Likud candidate Ariel Sharon will become the
next Prime Minister of the Jewish State of Israel. If<br>
so, Sharon will almost certainly be a bad omen for the Palestinian people, the so-called
peace process, and even for the Jewish State itself.<br>
The Palestinian people (and other Arab peoples as well) know Sharon almost too well. His
record is quite stark and very red; his military career, which extends over a period of
six decades, is soaked with Palestinian, Egyptian and Jordanian blood. His most
conspicuous credentials include the masterminding and overseeing of the Sabra and Shatilla
massacres by his Christian Phalangist allies in September of 1982, which earned him the
title of &#147;Israel&#146;s most distinguished war criminal.&#148;<br>
Prior to his blitz into Lebanon in the summer of 1982, which was aimed at crushing the PLO
&#147;once and for all&#148; in order to pacify and irreversibly conquer the West Bank and
Gaza, Sharon led a murderous career, which was gruesome, even by Israel&#146;s liberal
standards. In 1956, he ordered the execution of hundreds, some say thousands, of Egyptian
prisoners of war<br>
in the Sinai peninsula. Recent revelations by survivors indicated that Sharon ordered at
least 600-700 Egyptian POWs to be crushed by Israeli Centurions, the British-supplied
tanks used then by the Israeli army.<br>
In the first few years of Israel&#146;s occupation of the Gaza Strip in 1967, the
&#147;bulldozer,&#148; as Sharon later came to be known, sought to bulldoze half of the
Gaza Strip in order to annihilate the Fedayeen and deter Gazans from launching resistance
attacks on the occupation army. The orchards of Gaza, the narrow streets and peaceable
sands must all testify to the man&#146;s<br>
brutality and ruthlessness.<br>
Now, at age 75, it is really doubtful that the hero of Sabra and Shatila has changed his
ways or reformed his criminal mind. Indeed, his real nature was again brought to the fore
two months ago when he, as opposition leader, suggested that Palestinian towns be
subjected to blanket bombing by the Israeli army and that PA leaders be arrested or
assassinated. He also<br>
called on Barak, whose hands are equally stained with children&#146;s blood, to sever
electricity and telephone links to Palestinian population centres.<br>
Sharon is still firmly opposed to the Oslo process despite its scandalous lopsidedness in
Israel&#146;s favour. On 17 January, the Israeli Hebrew daily, <em>Ha&#146;aretz</em>,
published Sharon&#146;s political platform <em>vis-à-vis</em> the Palestinians.<br>
The platform includes the proposed establishment of a number of scattered and truncated
Palestinian bantustans on nearly 40% of the West Bank, which would be lacking contiguity
and territorial continuity.<br>
Moreover, the &#147;plan&#148; would include the annexation by Israel of all the existing
settlements in &#147;Judea, Samaria and Gaza,&#148; as well as keeping all of Jerusalem
under Israeli control and sovereignty.<br>
Finally, Israel would retain control of the Jordan Valley, meaning that whatever PA entity
to be created on the West Bank would have no direct borders with the East Bank of Jordan. <br>
Now, in return for all this &#147;magnanimity&#148; on Sharon&#146;s part, which he
apparently hopes the Palestinians would laud as the best promise for peace, the Likud
leader demands &#147;full security and intelligence coordination with the PA against
terrorism.&#148; <br>
Combating terrorism, or more accurately stopping all forms of Palestinian resistance
against Israel&#146;s enduring occupation, is <em>sine qua non</em> for any arrangement
with the Palestinians.<br>
<br>
<strong><u>Sharon should be taken seriously<br>
</u></strong>Sharon is not hallucinating, and he seems to mean what he says, unlike Barak
and Netanyahu whose policies and political styles are marked with a preponderance of
prevarication and verbal juggling.<br>
In light, it is very likely that the man, if he is elected Prime Minister, will seek to
carry out his threats against the Palestinian civilian population and the Palestinian
Authority. In this case, his brash pugnacity and bloody ruthlessness would tread on the
nerves of pro-American regimes in the region, particularly those of Egyptian President
Husni Mubarak and Jordan&#146;s young King Abdullah II, who have made &#145;the peace
process&#146; the main axis of their political strategy in the region. <br>
This is so because a violent alteration of the rules of the game (of the Oslo process) by
Sharon would effectively deal a final blow to the credibility of that process and stir up
Arab and Muslim masses against the &#147;moderate regimes.&#148; <br>
Moreover, the so-called regimes in this case are likely to come under mounting public
pressure to scale down relations with the U.S., Israel&#146;s ultimate protector and
financier, which could stir up instability and trigger violence against American and
Western targets throughout the region.<br>
With these looming prospects of Sharon&#146;s ascendance to the helm of power in the
Zionist regime, the Palestinian leadership ought to seek a logical strategy that would
successfully counter Sharon&#146;s bellicosity, intransigence and territorial
aggrandizement. <br>
Indeed, since the crux and gist of Sharon&#146;s strategy toward Palestinians is the
consolidation and perpetuation of apartheid in the West Bank, where the occupation
arrogates all the assets and we, the Palestinians, are forced to incur all the
liabilities, it is only logical that we adopt a counter-strategy aimed at undoing and
nullifying apartheid by making it boomerang on the Zionists. <br>
In real terms, what we would demand is an end to occupation, segregation, and racial
discrimination in all their forms. In a nutshell, we have to tell Sharon that we, like the
Black Africans and the African National Congress, reject apartheid and insist on the
dismantling of the apartheid system, not only in the West Bank and Gaza, but in the whole
of Palestine.<br>
We would have to tell him (and the rest of the world) that we are no longer interested in
the establishment of a hapless and deformed Palestinian State on the West Bank&#151;that
would be the Zionists&#146; problem, not ours&#151;and instead insist on living in
Palestine on condition we enjoy full democratic rights whereby people are allowed to live
wherever they wish to live and are granted full civil rights irrespective of their
religion and ethnicity.<br>
Call this &#147;turning the table upside down,&#148; or &#147;strategic
transformation,&#148; or whatever one wishes to call it, but what distinguishes this
strategy is that it is logical and commonsensical; it is also humane and doesn&#146;t
involve the uprooting of people from their homeland. Yes, Israel, the Zionist State, as we
have known it (a racist and militant State that thrives on aggression and war), would have
to come to an end as such. Israel-Palestine would no longer be a State for the Jews only,
but a State of, for and by all its citizens. <br>
Now, it is almost natural that Sharon and other Zionists would reject this strategy out of
hand and would claim, wrongly, that it would amount to destroying Israel.<br>
Well, the Palestinians are not, and should not appear to be, bent on destroying Israel.
The Palestinian people should appear as interested in the deconstruction rather than the
destruction of Israel, namely cleaning it of racism by ending Zionism, and in allowing the
Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and villages from which they were expelled
and banished at gunpoint when the Zionist regime was established in 1948.<br>
I believe this is the only strategy that could counter Sharon and ilk since any other
alternative, including the two-State solution, would only perpetuate apartheid.<br>
The two-State solution is outdated and becoming impractical and unrealistic. For in order
for this solution to succeed, Israel would have to dismantle 150 towns in the West Bank, a
task that no Israeli government would even think of embarking on.<br>
Fortunately, this could eventually work in the Palestinians&#146; favour in the long run,
for if the settlers are not uprooted and are allowed to live wherever they wish, the
Palestinians, including the refugees, will have to be treated likewise, e.g. allowed to
return to their homes in Haifa, Yaffa, Akka and Safad, in accordance with the principle of
reciprocity.<br>
If Israel says &#147;no&#148; to the one-State solution, and continues to refuse to
withdraw to the 1967-borders and repatriate and compensate the refugees, then the
Palestinians would have to terminate all political efforts.<br>
Israel will eventually come knocking on our doors, because there are 4.5 million
Palestinians in Palestine now, who, within a few years, will effectively undo Zionism.
Time is on our side. So, why the hurry?</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Our Patrimony Is For Sale!</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shehadeh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If moral principles and international legality are the criterion to
measure our successes, then we have done a very good job in this field, but if
implementation of these principles enter into such criterion then we have reached a tragic
failure. For the last fifty-two years, the world had no choice but to declare time after
time that the UN resolutions with regard to Palestine have to be implemented, if a genuine
and a fair peace are to prevail in the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well we have entered into the Oslo agreement with the Zionists, basing the
negotiations on UN Resolution 242 and 338. The whole world including the pro-Israel US,
had no choice but to declare that the entire area occupied in 1967 including E. Jerusalem
is considered an occupied territory and therefore subject to the principle of territorial
integrity embodied in the UN charter (article 2), and therefore 242. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead of negotiating the mechanics of implementations we were
negotiating the principle itself, not realizing in the process that 242 was a result of an
already established UN principle of the inadmissibility of acquiring land by the use of
force, based on the above article. Such process would immediately compromise the very
principle we are advocating, and place us on the side that would violate the UN
resolutions. Realizing that, Israel embarked on taking advantage of such PA compromising
position, which resulted in doubling the settlements in the West Bank while confiscating
more lands in the process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now we are reaching the climax of concessions when our
&#147;glorious&#148; PA are asking the Israelis at Taba, not necessarily to implement the
Palestinian right of return as embodied in UN resolution 194, but to have Israel simply
agree in principle to such right, and of course without implementations. So the sad, but
expected outcome would be that we were able to convince Israel to accept such legal
principles in theories but never mind the implementations.. We win the principle
underlying 242, but they keep the land. We win the principle underlying 194 for the
Palestinians right of return, but our refugees will not be allowed to return. I would not
be surprised if our leadership would declare a national holiday commemorating the PA
winning the principles through negotiations with Israel while losing our national rights
and our patrimony in the process. In essence we are repeating Clinton&#146;s proposals
using the sake tricks that 194 should be the basis for the Palestinians right of return,
but &#147; I would be against their return to Israel&#148;, he added.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This peace, if signed, would be nothing more than a mockery of all
negotiated peace protocols through out history. The PA in this case has flagrantly
trespassed on our minimal national rights and have turned over to the Zionist enemy, out
lands, our pride, our history, our freedom and our hope for a better future. It should
behoove our leadership to realize that such peace could never last, and what they have
done is nothing more than planting the seeds of more violence, more bloodshed and more
victims. No one, not Mr. Arafat, and no one else for that matter, have the right to sign
our ancestor&#146;s homeland to our tormentors. How and in what manner could such
leadership face our oppressed masses? Are they going to start a new business of opening
travelling agencies that would distribute brochures about the beautiful landscapes of
Canada and the US, as possible final destinations for resettlements of our refugees? Are
they going to tell us that Palestine could no longer be considered our patrimony and we
should find a place where no one could hear of us anymore? Would they not be emulating the
unwavering goal of Zionism that demanded our disappearance into oblivion? Would the PA
message be that all those who have been suffering and rotting at our refugees camps should
rot further and there will be no way to relieve their suffering? Are they telling all of
us that all those honorable martyrs who has died for our national cause have died in vain?
I have imagined all possibilities, but it never crossed my mind that the very leaders who
inspired us to fight against Zionism are the very same leaders who advocating to lay down
our arms and succumb to most if not all the Zionist demands. As Sharon in explained the
meaning of land for peace negotiations; the Israelis would keep the lands and we would
give them the peace ala Israeli style. Is our leadership intoxicated with power that they
don&#146;t realize that since they assumed their shameful roles in the peace process, they
have turned almost 180 degrees to meet almost all Israeli positions on Jerusalem, the
borders, the refugees, and the settlements? Can our leaders point out the difference
between their positions and those of the Israelis? I doubt it!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s time for our present leaders to retire immediately and leave the
struggle to a new blood, to a new leadership who believes that our homeland is not for
sale. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Our Violent Society </font></b><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><b>E. Yaghi</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Without the Palestinians, Palestine dies. Her rivers are poisoned,
the sources dry out, the hills and valleys disfigured, her fields are worked by imported
Chinese, while her sons are imprisoned in ghettos.&#148; Israeli Shamir. </i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My name is Rafi. I am an American Israeli and a former member of the IDF
or Israeli Defense Force. To say the least, I am shocked about how violent our society has
become, especially since the latest Palestinian uprising. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Somehow we have convinced the world and even ourselves that we are the
victims of violence, but in truth, we are the perpetrators. Yes, at one time, we suffered
from discrimination and hate. We lived in ghettos and we were shamed by our Jewishness.
Because of the suffering of generations of European Jews, some of us wanted a homeland
where we would no longer have to live in shame or fear acts of hatred against us simply
because we happened to be Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our very conception was wrong. We picked a land that was already inhabited
by a native people. Through the use of terror, liquidation, and brute force, we coerced
these peaceful people to flee their homes and to either settle as refugees in that land
which we had not yet confiscated from them, or in neighboring Arab countries. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After the Holocaust, we were unwanted refugees and it was due to this fact
and also in order for America to gain a foothold in the Middle East through us, that we
were able to gather weapons, and military support from Britain and America. Even though
most of us were able to return to our former European homes after World War II, we chose
to conquer and occupy the land and homes of another people who had been living in their
own country for thousands of years. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We told the world that we were the rightful owners and we devised so many
falsehoods and distorted history to such an extent that we began to believe ourselves. We
have always stood for freedom as long as it was Jewish freedom. We have always supported
human rights as long as those rights were Jewish human rights. We claim to have the only
democracy in the Middle East, though our democracy is for Jews only and through subtle use
of religion, we exclude all who are not Jews from our government we claim to be by and for
the people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When the outraged Palestinians lynched two of our undercover agents in
Ramallah, we called them criminals and savages. But what I saw on the streets of Beit
Hadassah defies all savagery. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On January 12, Shaker, a young Palestinian man, was chased by soldiers
from the IDF through the streets of Jerusalem. Jerusalem is holy to Jews, Christians and
Muslims. It is a city wind worn, people torn, and a place where the prophets of the three
great monotheistic faiths once walked. But what I saw was neither holy nor righteous. What
I saw was our soldiers sadistically dragging the body of the not yet dead young man
through the streets of Jerusalem as they laughed. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The body was dragged to our own part of the city, Beit Hadassah, where
some Jewish settlers rejoiced at the blood gushing forth from his stricken body and as he
gasped his last breath, these same settlers sang, danced, passed out candy and shouted
congratulations to one another. I was reminded of cheetahs and hyenas that kill and drag
their prey. But these animals kill to survive; they do not kill for pleasure. Our
soldiers, on the other hand, kill to maintain an apartheid system. And unlike the cheetahs
and hyenas, they rejoice and celebrate the death of the Palestinian fallen. I fail to see
anything civilized or heroic about the way this young man was slaughtered. Had he been a
lamb, we would have protested in indignation had he been treated in such a manner. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I wish that the savagery ended here. But it did not. Some of the Israelis
crushed our victim&#146;s skull in, gouged out his eyes and cut off his nose. Though the
dead do not feel pain, what was done to this poor young man defies all reason and is the
most grotesque and savage thing I have yet to hear of. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am sorry that Shaker was butchered in such an inhuman way. Those
responsible for the manner in which he was killed should be charged and brought to trial.
Those of us who laughed, sang, danced and passed out candy while he still showed signs of
life should bury our heads in shame. We are guilty of crimes against humanity and if we
continue on such a path of self-destruction, we will have no more humanity left within us.
We, the victims of a long ago Holocaust, have created the new Palestinian Holocaust. It is
high time we stop butchering the innocents, shed our masks of feigned abuse by a
weaponless people, and take a long hard look at what we have become. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As long as we are dishonest with the world and ourselves, we will never
achieve peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The image of this stricken young man and how he was dragged through the
streets, kicked and jeered at while he was yet alive, haunt me. Even worse, the way he was
mutilated after he died, even further sicken me. God help us all for what we have done and
for what we are doing. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Anti Defamation League: <br>
Censoring the Internet on Behalf of Israel</font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><em>Ramzy Baroud*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In a mid-December conference in Jerusalem, computer experts, governmental
officials and academics gathered under the banner of, &quot;Confronting On-Line Terrorism
and Anti-Semitism.&quot; Amongst the names of sponsors and co-sponsors, one organization
stands as the most active by far in the field of censorship, mainly in the United States:
the Anti Defamation League (ADL). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What compels dozens of professionals and activists to fly long distances
from all corners of the globe to meet in a &quot;disputed city&quot; only miles away from
a war zone? It's the fear of losing a greater war, a war that has cost Israel an
abundance, that is the Internet media war. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps since the establishment of the ADL in 1913 to &quot;fight
anti-Semitism and bigotry in the world&quot;, the gigantic organization with hundreds of
offices in the U.S., Europe and Israel has never felt as outnumbered as it feels today.
The Internet revolution, among its many positive aspects, has given a voice to those who,
unlike the ADL, are unable to rely on a $46 million budget to spread their message. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ADL has a powerful lobby which deeply influences U.S. domestic as well
as foreign policy and has come under repeated attacks over the years and was heavily cited
for failing to champion what its preaches. In fact, it is accused of being a promoter of
hatred and bigotry itself. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the 1970s, the group was caught distributing lists of persons deemed as
enemies, according to<b> </b>SF Weekly in its February issue. Among those who were defamed
for being &quot;pro-Arab propagandists&quot; was the highly<b> </b>renowned professor Noam
Chomskey. In 1993, according to the same source, the ADL was caught illegally spying on
nearly 10,000 people &quot;including members of socialist, labour and anti-apartheid
groups.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But why would an organization whose &quot;ultimate purpose is to secure
justice and fair treatment for all citizens alike and to put an end forever to injustice
and unfair discrimination against and ridicule of any sect or body of citizens&quot; carry
out such suspicious tasks? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The number one goal of the ADL is the protection of Israel,&quot;
former Republican congressman from San Mateo Pete McCloskey told SF Weekly in a recent
interview. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The organization, however, which claims to fight for other issues beside
its vibrant defense of Israel, has done very little in recent months to demonstrate those
claims. The outbreak of the Palestinian uprising against the Israeli occupation caused the
ADL to gear up for one fight, and one fight only: supporting Israel and censoring those
who criticize the Jewish State for using excessive violence, for violating international
law and for committing genocide in areas which are supposed to be protected under human
rights laws. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The organization, which often legitimizes its missions by fighting minor
and highly despised groups in the U.S. such as white supremacists, has unmasked its real
identity and has joined Israel's propaganda war, employing all of its resources to justify
the Israeli army's ongoing genocide of unarmed civilians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ADL's website is a perfect example of the organization's full-fledged
support of Israel. While the overwhelming majority of deaths, many of whom were children,
were Palestinians, the ADL seemed only concerned with the Israeli army's and settlers'
losses. &quot;Anti-Israel violence&quot; is a section that is updated daily. Nothing was
said regarding the loss of life among Palestinians, nothing about the murder of children
such as Muhammad al-Durra, nothing to explain the illegal status of the Israeli settlers
and, of course, nothing to site the international laws concerning the Arab-Israeli
conflict. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the United Nations was itself under attack. The ADL says the UN
Human Rights Chief has accepted &quot;hook, line and sinker&quot; Palestinian strategy and
calls her report &quot;distorted and detrimental,&quot; charged one of the site's top
reports. The U.S. government was itself under attack. The ADL says &quot;U.S. criticism of
Israel's retaliatory action for an attack on a school bus is counterproductive.&quot; And,
of course, Arabs and Muslims were left with the largest share of attacks and threats. The
ADL says &quot;if Egypt doesn't return its ambassador to Israel in a timely manner,
America should reassess U.S. aid to Egypt.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the Internet showed that the ADL, despite its resources and influence
no matter how large and long-armed, is still vulnerable. The rapidly growing Arab and
Muslim presence on the Internet alarmed the ADL that its endless propaganda campaign may
be doomed if the Internet is not censored, resulting in a situation whereby the ADL's
voice would no longer be the only one heard. Hence, the introduction of the Hate Filter. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ADL describes its Hate Filter as &quot;a software product designed to
act as a gatekeeper.&quot; Once more to legitimize its censorship efforts, the ADL
succeeded in introducing its product as part of Mattel's Cyber Patrol, a software package
set to block a large range of offensive websites, including pornographic ones. Moreover,
the organization is ceaselessly working to enforce its product on private and public
libraries and educational institutions. President Clinton has already endorsed the
software. In a statement made during October of last year following a meeting with the
ADL's national director, Abraham Foxman, Clinton said, &quot;Thank you for your pioneering
work to filter out hate on the internet.&quot; The ADL's director of civil rights
Elizabeth Coleman said in a seminar earlier this year that Vice President Al Gore has also
seen and has endorsed the product and in fact &quot;loved it.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">McCloskey, on the other hand, protested the ADL's seemingly successful
censorship attempts saying, &quot;Any group whose sole purpose is to protect a foreign
nation should not have anything to say about what's said or written here in America.&quot;
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Intifada and the cyber war, which was provoked by Israeli hacker
attacks on pro-Palestinian websites, are reminders of the vulnerability of the ADL and
other Israeli and pro-Israeli groups when it comes to the World Wide Web. As a result, the
recent Jerusalem conference was a badly needed chance for the re-making of a new media
strategy that would withstand the upsurge of an Arab and Muslim presence on the Internet. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The mounting worries of pro-Israeli groups were stressed in the speech
delivered by the director of the ADL's Israel office, David Rosen. Rosen warned of what he
called Islamic propaganda, which he described as one upholding Christian Anti-Semitic
themes. &quot;The lone wolf of the past is no longer such and can link up to become a
pack,&quot; he said. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Why We Palestinians Will Never Give Up</strong> </font></h3>
<em><b>

<p ALIGN="center">Samah Jabr*</b></em></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My grandmother is getting old. She spends most of her days at her home.
She usually disappoints us when we invite her to join in some family gathering. &quot;I'm
so achy and full of pain,&quot; she says, &quot;I better just stay where I am.&quot; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">My brother and I decided to change our strategy with her. Yesterday, we
didn't ask her to come with us, we just went to her place, literally picked her up, put
her in the car and took her up the hill and around the corner. We took her home with us.
Her unexpected visit was the extra love and warmth our family needed in the midst of war
around us. You see, Grandma is <br>
our heart. Mother to 11 children and grandmother to 35, she brought us all up with dishes
of lemon-flavoured milk and crispy pudding, magical tales and a tremendous amount of love.
She personifies the importance of family to us and makes us who we are in our Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, our grandma is not the closeted housewife and mother image that
many Westerners have of Arab women. In truth, this image as well as the patriarchal
realities of the past are fading quickly as more and more Palestinian women take on both
careers and raising families.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our grandmother and her mother before her, however, were forerunners of
the modern Arab woman in our country. Grandma's mother was widowed before grandma arrived.
Granny was born in the Palestinian coastal city, Yaffa, in <br>
1912. Four uncles attended to the family with as much care and concern as they did for
their own immediate families. Nevertheless, our great-grandmother did not stay home behind
veiled windows to simply enjoy privilege. She had a huge house, which she herself
supported by owning and managing three stores in the port area of Yaffa. She was educated
and <br>
worldly and a superb business woman. I don't know if great-grandmother smoked, but grandma
did and from the age of 14, no less. We all lament that fact, today.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1936, grandma, now a married woman, began to feel the pressures of life
in Palestine. Our grandfather and three of her brothers were arrested for being involved
in the rebellion against the British, whose mandate government controlled much of their
lives at the time. Great-grandmother's stores were closed and her stock confiscated to
punish the family for the <br>
young men's rebellious attitudes. It is not just the Israelis who use collective
punishment to control the place they want to rule. The British made this practice a
reality for our relatives long before 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Nakba (The Israeli occupation of Palestine in 1948)
affected grandma even more, though. In 1948, when the Zionists arrived, massacring people
and destroying villages on the outskirts of Yaffa in order to stir fear in the hearts of
the citizens of the city, grandma's family stood helpless and without resources to resist.
They were violently forced to walk out of their house and into trucks going where they did
not know. They had to leave everything behind: clothes, money, furniture, 14 pairs of
doves, a great jasmine tree that our grandfather planted in honour of his and granny's
wedding. The personal effects did not matter much to the family, but the idea of leaving
living things like the doves and the special tree broke their hearts. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our great-grandmother died on the truck unable to physically tolerate her
displacement. The rest of the family fared better. Our grandfather, a respected teacher,
did not stay in a refugee camp, but took the family to Jerusalem. There, he got a job as
principle of the only school for orphans in the ancient city at the time, Dar Al-Aytam
School for Boys. The family lived in a beautiful old house set high on a knoll in the Old
City. We say that the house #13 on Bab Al-Hadid housing compund sat on the roof of the Old
City. Built 450 years before our grandparents moved in during the regime of the great
Muslim ruler Salahiddin Al-Ayyoubi, the house proudly displayed traditional arched windows
and doors. The family could stand on their little balcony and look across the tight
mingling of elegant houses to the esplanade of al-Haram al-Sharif. The Dome of the Rock
Mosque was in full view. Although my grandparents and all their children adapted and
enjoyed their new home in <br>
historic Jerusalem, it was not in them to forget what they had lost or left behind:
great-grandmother, the jasmine tree and the doves. They could not go back and get the tree
to transplant or the doves to put into a now cote even though Yaffa wasn't all that far
away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Then, in 1967, trauma again asserted itself into my family's lives. Israel
invaded the rest of the land we had always known as Palestine and began an occupation I
have lived with my entire life. It was a dreadful transition and many of our young
Palestinians reacted with furor. One of my grandmother's teenage sons, Ghassan Kamal, an
uncle I never knew, heard the <br>
news of the Zionist invasion when he was in school. He did not come home that night and my
grandparents heard nothing from him or about him until 8 September 1969 when they saw his
picture in a newspaper with a story saying that he was responsible for a bus bombing in
West Jerusalem. He was incarcerated, three of his brothers were sent abroad into exile and
our family's glorious old house was confiscated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was, in effect, the beginning of an ongoing suffering for all of us.
Our grandma survived. Even today she sits like one of our uprooted olive trees, roots a
detached tangle, branches weeping on the ground, but dignity remaining. Our grandfather
did not survive the upheaval and died soon after it was clear that he would not find his
son and that his other sons were no longer content to study and spend their lives held
tight in the arms of a loving family.<br>
<br>
Now, today, we sit together as Arab families do, but not under the happy circumstances
that grandma grew up in. Grandma will have to stay the night because we dare not drive her
home, a few blocks away, during the curfew imposed upon us. I watch my grandma as we sit
in our living room drinking rich Arabic coffee. Thoughts of the history of her life swirl
through my head. I watch the twinkle in her eye as she sips her coffee with us, delighted
that we have brought her to be with us. She would like the evening even more if we'd give
her just one cigarette, but that won't happen.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We turn on the television to watch a special programme on Palestinian
refugees and the peace process. A reporter explains various American proposals suggesting
a trade. If the Israelis agree to allow refugees to come home or at least make reparation
for land their military and governments have taken, surely, then, we Palestinians will
return to them peace. I suggest, &quot;They say they want peace, but act as if they do not
care about it at all. The idea of conquering us seems quite fixed in Israeli Zionist
behaviour regardless of the words told to the world via television and newspapers. We sit
in silence except for the drone from the television. Then, granny speaks up. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;I won't live long enough to go back to my house in Yaffa. But you
kids, do not forget our house in Yaffa. It is yours.&quot;<br>
Still, the rest of us do not speak. We do not bring up the declarations and conventions
and United Nations resolutions that speak of the right of return, the inalienable right of
human beings to own property and to find validity in their lives through their heritage
and their traditions. We do not want to trouble granny's dream of us going home even if
she can't. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">That night watching my family, I wished the world could peek in our window
to see us as we really are. Surely, seeing our granny and us and her great-grandchildren
running in and out of the room would make clear to the world why Palestinians resist so
hard. In my own heart and, I'm pretty sure, in the hearts of my mom and dad and brother
and sisters, not to forget many beyond our immediate family, there resides a determination
that our grandparents have bequeathed to us.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I remember thinking to myself, &quot;Don't worry, Grandma, we Palestinians
do not trade our rights and our heritage. This determination to stay is what makes us your
heirs. Yaffa, Akka, Haifa and every single Palestinian town and village remains in our
minds and hearts through the stories we've heard from our revered elders, from you,
Granny. We will not go until this time of war ends and we return to ourselves what is
ours.&quot; I went over and gave my grandma a hug. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Role of America in Palestine:<br>
Duplicity And Treachery</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Anver Suliman</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Time and again it has been asked why is &#145;peace&#146; so elusive in
the Middle East. To understand the problem in Palestine one has to analyse the partial and
self-interested role of America. Does America really want peace in the region? Herein lies
the problem. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The answer to this question has been elucidated years ago by author such
as Noam Chomsky, Edward Said, Israel Shahak and the late Ismail Al Faruqi. In some
quarters these personalities do not exist or never existed at all. I once quoted from
Israel Shahak`s work &#145;Jewish History, Jewish Religion&#146; to a Jewish Professor who
questioned the existence of Israel Shahak. (Shahak is a retired Professor of Organic
Chemistry who taught at the University of Jerusalem in Tel Aviv)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the forward of Noam Chomsky`s book &#145;Fateful Triangle- the United
States, Israel and the Palestinians&#146;, Edward Said comments: &#145; Chomsky`s major
claim is that Israel and the United States, especially the latter- are rejectionists
opposed to peace, whereas the Arabs, including the PLO, have for years been trying to
accommodate themselves to the reality of Israel. Chomsky supports his case by comparing
the history of the Palestine-Israel conflict- so profoundly inhuman, cynical and
deliberately cruel to the Palestinian people with its systematically rewritten record as
kept by those whom Chomsky calls &#147;The supporters of Israel&#148; </p>
<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="4">

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;&#133;</font> Chomsky includes invaluable material on Oslo and Wye
accords- an unnecessary line of Arab capitulation by which Israel has achieved all its
tactical and strategic objectives at the expense of every proclaimed principle of Arab and
Palestinian Nationalism and struggle. For the first time in the twentieth century, an
anti- colonial liberation movement has not only discarded its own considerable
achievements but has made an agreement to cooperate with a military occupation before that
occupation has ended.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel Shahak is of the same view that Israel has not really changed and
like America do not want peace with the Palestinians and other Arabs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So coming to the crux of the question as to the real intention of America
in the region, the late Ismail Al- Faruqi sites two overriding American interests:
dictated assumption by the United States of the whole burden of European colonialism in
the area following World War II: Anti-Soviet military strategy and oil.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The creation of the state of Israel served at once all the purposes,
strategy and interest of America, viz:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To provide, in case of another world war, a friendly base whose friendship
to the West depends upon its own inevitable need for protection by the West for survival.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To provide a sore capable of draining all energies and resources of the
surrounding areas so as to retard, if not to render impossible, any reconstruction that
would make them more capable of resisting Christian Western domination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Since the discovery of oil in the Arabian Peninsula in the thirties, to
provide a strong but dependent friendly Israel which can be counted upon to assist in the
security of this tremendous and vital resource.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To provide a cause which would throw the whole area into constant turmoil
and thereby enable Western domination to fulfill its colonialist exploitative objectives
more cheaply and easily.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To provide an apparently non-Western &#145;hatchet&#146; which can be
manipulated and hurled by the West at any state seeking to rid the area of Christian
influence.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To provide relief to the Christian Western conscience ridden with the
guilt- complex of Christendom&#146;s crimes against the Jews over two millennia.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To subvert the worldly power of Islam by splitting it into an Asian half
and an African half separated by an insurmountable barrier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Noam Chomsky is also of the view that the strategic importance of the
region lies primarily in its immense petroleum reserves and the global power accorded by
control over them; and, crucially, from the huge profits that flow to the Anglo-American
rulers, which have been of critical importance for their economics.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It has been necessary to ensure that this enormous wealth flows primarily
to the West, not to the people of the region. That is one fundamental problem that will
continue to cause unrest and disorder. Another is the Arab- Israel conflict with its many
ramifications, which have been closely related to the major US strategic goal of
dominating the regions resources and wealth.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The peace that never was!</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shehadeh</i></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The miserable status quo before Oslo and our hopes for an honourable peace
that might alleviate the long suffering of our people led many of us, including myself, to
believe that Oslo could become the vehicle for a final peace that might restore our
national rights in our homeland. One aspect of such optimism was the fact that Oslo was
based on United Nations resolution 242 and the right of return resolution embodied in 194.
To my understanding, resolution 242 was already an established international resolution
based on Article 2 of the UN Charter respecting the territorial integrity of nations and
spelling out the basic principle of the inadmissibility of acquiring land by the use of
force. It also spelled out the principle of solving the problem of the Palestinian
refugees, which again was embodied in UN resolution 194 of 1948 allowing the Palestinian
refugees to return and live in peace in their patrimony.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was normal then to assume that Oslo peace negotiations should have been
based on the mechanics of implementing 242 and 194 and not on negotiating the resolutions
themselves. Every single inch of land that Israel sits on has been acquired by the use of
force and therefore compromises the UN Charter and all international legalities embodied
in the Fourth Geneva Convention. It did not take long to realize that Oslo became the
Israeli vehicle to get the Palestinians to recognize what Israel had illegally seized in
1948, which represented almost 78 per cent of Palestine, while they continue to negotiate
how much more they can acquire from the remaining West Bank. Worse yet, Israel has used
such negotiations to abrogate the Palestinians' right of return as spelled out in UN
resolution 194 and their total irresponsibility for the numberless atrocities committed
against the Palestinians in their relentless quest to evict them from their homeland. One
might argue that such Israeli actions should not come as a surprise to those who were
confronted with the 52-year bloody history of Israel in the region, but what is extremely
shocking is the strange collaboration of the present Palestinian leadership within this
illegal framework of negotiations. Since Oslo, the number of illegal Jewish settlements
and the Jewish settlers in the West Bank has almost doubled while Israeli plans to turn
the remnants of the West Bank into a dissected collection of Palestinian ghettos has
become the main Israeli objective in our lands. The Israelis were able to accomplish those
objectives with Palestinian blessings through the Oslo peace accords that which they were
unable to attain in a state of war.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When confronted with such a miserable fiasco, our leaders are quick to
respond (and quite naively) that we do not have any other badeel (alternative). They would
be quick to point out that the Arab leaders are competing with who is going to recognize
Israel first while doing their best to pressure the Palestinians to acquiesce to the
unacceptable taboos of the past. One has to be pragmatic, they add, since Israel--with the
full backing of the U.S.--is too strong to fight. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What our leaders fail miserably to understand is that without the
Palestinian card no peace could ever prevail in the Middle East. Without the Palestinian
blessings no Arab country could normalize relations with the Zionist State. Without the
Palestinian approval Israel would never achieve its long-sought goal of becoming an
acceptable permanent member of the Middle East community. Surely, Israel is a formidable
opponent militarily and, for the time being, we cannot claim to be a match to such force,
but by studying history we should realize that superior force has not been the deciding
factor in achieving final victory. In contemporary history, the Vietnamese, the Algerians,
the Chechnians, Hizbullah and many others have successfully defeated superior armies. This
should teach us all that in the final analysis, the determination of the oppressed is the
most important factor in defeating superior forces. None of our leaders have the authority
to sign away our patrimony to the Zionist occupiers, and none of our leaders have the
legal right to abrogate any international legalities embodied in UN resolutions through
their negotiations with the Zionist occupiers, and none of our leaders have the right to
contravene the Palestinian right of return. If they cannot accomplish liberation, then
they should simply abdicate their positions to a younger leadership that believes in the
full national rights of our people. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Remembrance and Denial:</font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">Holocaust victims here, Palestinian refugees
there</font></h3>
<em>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</em></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">While the incumbent Labour government in Britain was remembering the
&#145;six million&#146; victims of Nazi genocide, the outgoing Democratic administration
in the United States was making a last-ditch attempt to prevent the return of 5 million
Palestinian refugees to their homeland. Neither the British decision to designate 27
January as Holocaust Remembrance Day nor Bill Clinton&#146;s &#145;Bridging
Proposals&#146;--which denied the right of return--came as surprises. They nevertheless
confirmed how very little Western attitudes and policies have changed toward Palestine
during the last 100 years.</p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Remembrance</u></b><br>
Britain&#146;s apparent blind support for the discredited American peace process has been
a cause of growing concern both at home and abroad. Things have gotten to the stage where
even members within the ruling Labour Party are now voicing their profound misgivings
about the country&#146;s policy toward the Arab-Israeli conflict. Thus, on 19 December
2000, the Foreign Office Minister, Peter Hain, appeared before a House of Commons Select
Committee to face questions on Britain&#146;s human rights policy. With regard to the
Middle East, he was specifically called upon to explain the almost total absence of
reference to Israeli human rights abuses in the occupied territories in the
government&#146;s 2000 human rights report. The report was so brief in its reference and
timid in its criticism of Israel that one member of the Committee, Dr. Phyllis Starkey,
asked the Minister whether he was not ashamed that even the United States human rights
report was much stronger in its condemnation even though America is &#145;the most
favourable government to Israel in the whole world.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When asked why his government had made no attempt to activate the human
rights clause in the trade agreement between the European Union and Israel in which it was
agreed that in the case of serious human rights breaches the accord would be withdrawn,
the minister replied, &quot;We thought that the really important thing was, rather than
get into a dispute between the EU and Israel over this matter, to try and push forward the
peace process, because that, in the end, is the best guarantor of human rights
protection.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">What happened after the Select Committee dressing-down confirmed the most
English of proverbs that &#145;you can lead a horse to water but you can&#146;t make it
drink.&#146; Within a matter of days, the Prime Minister went ahead on 15 January 2001, in
spite of public protest, and addressed a Zionist fund-raising appeal organized by the
United Jewish Israel Appeal&#146;s (UJIA). The event, Jewish sources in London (Richard
Ferrer, &#145;Blair Backs UJIA Appeal&#146;, <i>TotallyJewish.Com</i>, 29 December 2000)
confirm, was intended to &#147;aid the influx of immigrant children to Israel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Was the Prime Minister so naïve to believe that these immigrants were all
going to &#145;Israel&#146; and not to the Occupied Territories? How could he be so
deluded after the number of settlers in the territories rocketed from 130,000 in September
1993 to 180,000 in 1999? Had he been in the place of Peter Hain before the Select
Committee he would have heard that the acceleration of settlement building &#145;has been
greater under the Barak Government than under the Netanyahu Government,&#146; which was
driven out of office in 1999. Whatever the case, the official line according to Mr. Hain
is, &#145;We do not recognize any basis in international law for these settlements.&#146;
They are, however, part of the process from which we &#145;hope&#146; there would be an
agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If anyone thought the Palestinians were the only victims they are
mistaken. Britain, it appears, has itself become a helpless victim of Zionist settler
aggression. Except for a muted cry of protest, there was not even a diplomatic slap on the
wrist for the attack by Jewish settlers on the vehicle carrying British Consul Robin Kealy
near Hebron in December 2000. Then again, one may ask, if the United Nations could not do
something about the shooting at the car carrying its High Commissioner for Human Rights in
November 2000, what do you expect from Britain? Thus, like so many others in high places,
the Prime Minister drifted along obediently and attended the function to promote settler
activity! This is the background to Britain&#146;s remembrance of the holocaust, so what
of the American denial?</p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Denial</u></b><br>
Every observer of the peace negotiations is convinced about one fact: that the plan
submitted to the parties by the Americans in July 2000 did not change after the outbreak
of the Aqsa Intifada. At best its form was slightly altered here and there but its basic
substance remained intact: that being the Palestinians would have some municipal control
over the religious sites in East Jerusalem for which they are expected to abandon the
right of return and declare the conflict closed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Like London, Washington was also prepared to turn a blind eye on the
violations of the Geneva Conventions and the very accords it brokered by financing Israeli
settlement activity. To the tune of an estimated $3 billion, it funded the construction of
a 250-mile network of bypass roads, which now divide the future Palestinian State into
isolated units fenced in by 29 &#147;security highways.&#148; It did this in violation of
Article IV of the Declaration of Principles that it brokered in 1993, which says,
&#147;The two sides view the West Bank and Gaza Strip as a single territorial unit, whose
integrity will be preserved during the interim period.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the whole, the Americans have been less charitable in their aid to the
Palestinians. In one noticeable area, concerning the refugees, Washington has displayed an
unusual degree of generosity. It offered upward of $40 billion in compensation for the
resettlement of the refugees in Arab countries and to a lesser degree in the future
Palestinian state.<sup>1</sup> </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the event, Palestinian rights and aspirations have hardly come into
play. What is clearly of paramount importance to the peace mediators is the attainment of
a solution that pleases Israel. But if finding a solution is difficult, pleasing Israel is
infinitely more demanding. This is why when the Palestinian negotiators insisted that they
could not accept a proposal that neither secured the establishment of a viable Palestinian
State nor the right of the refugees to their homes, Mr. Clinton insisted that they should
agree first to his proposals and then discuss its alteration after! While the world awaits
to see whether the &#145;come-back kid&#146; may return to the region to play some kind of
roving ambassadorial role or assume the top job at the United Nations, Palestinians will,
in the meantime, remember him not as an impartial mediator but as an overzealous enforcer
of the Israeli agenda, especially when it comes to the refugee issue. They would never
forget that it was during the first Clinton presidential term that the U.S. took the
unprecedented step of refusing to reaffirm General Assembly resolution 194 in December
1993. And that it was its UN representative, Madeleine Albright, who in August 1994 told
the GA that &#147;We believe that resolution language referring to the &#145;final
status&#146; issues should be dropped&#133;these include the refugees.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whether he comes or goes is inconsequential in the larger scheme of
things. More importantly, the right of return would remain enshrined in the canons of
international law. It remains not just in resolution 194 but also in the American
Convention on Human Rights (art. 22, paragraph 5) and the European Convention for the
Protection of Human Rights and Fundamental Freedoms (art. 3, paragraph 2). The attempts to
bypass the international laws and human rights convention on refugees have, therefore,
given cause for continued caution and vigilance. </p>
<b><u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Caution and vigilance</u></b><br>
As the two sides dig themselves in for future rounds, the Palestinian position remains
fixed and unchangeable: that it is not enough for Israel to morally affirm the Palestinian
right of return. It must establish this right in accordance with UN resolution 194 and all
other instruments of international and human rights law. A recent document published on
the front page of <em>Ha&#146;aretz</em> on 2 January 2000, signed by prominent members of
the so-called liberal left in Israel, graphically demonstrated the vast difference between
affirmation and establishment of the right of return. It read, &#145;We recognize the true
and urgent need to resolve the problem of the 1948 refugees, and we recognize the role of
the State of Israel, also, in the creation of the problem. The refugees will have the
right to return to their homeland, Palestine, and settle there. But we shall never be able
to agree to the return of the refugees to within the borders of Israel, for the meaning of
such a return would be the elimination of the State of Israel.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, recognition of the problem and its cause is a step in the right
direction. But, it is not enough. Likewise, it is not enough to propose the return of
250,000 Palestinians from Lebanon to the future Palestinian State and Israel and expect
that this would be the end of the matter. In other words, a resolution of the refugee
problem must go well beyond the 12 UN registered camps in Lebanon. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Those who the Israelis refer to as Arab refugees are in fact the
Palestinian people. They constitute the nation that was supplanted by another during a
military invasion. They number 5,248,186 today. United Nations resolution 194 recognizes
each one of them as an individual with individual rights of resettlement in the country of
their origin. For this reason, their future cannot be a matter that is subject to
negotiations between States only.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for resolution 194, there are three aspects to it that must be
fulfilled: (1) the repatriation of the refugees, (2) the restitution of their property and
(3) their compensation for losses. The most important loss, undoubtedly, is that of land.
Israel did not only seize in excess of what it was given by the UN, but it also seized
land from the Palestinians who according to the partition plan were to become the majority
in the Jewish State. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Official records from the UN show that the proposed Jewish State at the
time of partition consisted of 509,780 Arabs and 499,020 Jews. By expelling the Arabs from
the area designated for the Jewish State, Israel has sought to create the impression that
the UN granted it territory only for Jews. This was never the case. Consequently, whoever
thinks that the refugee problem can be solved in isolation from the issue of land is
mistaken.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conflict has evidently come to the stage that many have been trying to
avoid for the past 50 years: how to right the wrong done to the Palestinian people? That
Israel was carved out of a land that belongs to the Palestinian people. This is the fact
that no diplomacy can cover up or deny. Even the so-called Israeli declaration of
independence acknowledges this when it says, &#147;We hereby proclaim the establishment of
the Jewish State in Palestine to be called &#145;Medinat Israel&#146; (the State of
Israel).&quot;</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"></font><font color="#0000FF">Trying again and again</font><i></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Edward Said</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The last-ditch American effort to make Yasser Arafat terminate his own
people's sovereign existence bears the heavy imprint not only of the US-Israeli lobby but
of Bill Clinton's political style. To say of Clinton's bridging proposals, as they have
been euphemistically called, that they are a sort of fast food peace is to diminish and
even underestimate their malevolent sloppiness. In their all-purpose catchiness, their
anti-historical bullying, and the egotistical urgency of their manner, what they most
resemble is Clinton at his desk, one hand holding the telephone to his ear, the other
clutching at the pizza slice he munches away at, even as his various staffers, funders,
fixers, cronies and golf-playing buddies mill around him giving (and getting) favors,
loans, grants, deals, mortgages, gossip. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is then scarcely a fitting end for a struggle that has cost hundreds
of thousands of lives and untold treasure for well over a century. Put forward in a
language that (speaking myself as a teacher of how language is used and abused) fairly
reeks of a dismissive silliness combined with vagueness, what Clinton proposes in effect
is a warmed-over Israeli intention to perpetuate control over Palestinian lives and land
for the foreseeable future. The underlying premise is that Israel needs protection from
Palestinians, not the other way round. And there's the flaw in the whole thing: that
Israel is not only forgiven its 33-year occupation, its 52-year oppression and
dispossession of the entire Palestinian people, its countless brutalizations and
dehumanization&#146;s of the Palestinians individually and collectively, but is rewarded
with such things as annexation of the best West Bank land, a long (and doubtless
inexpensive) lease of the Jordan Valley, and the terminal annexation of most of East
Jerusalem, plus early warning stations on Palestinian territories, plus control of all
Palestinian borders (which are only to be with Israel, not with any other state), plus all
the roads and water supply, plus the cancellation of all refugee rights of return and
compensation except as Israel sees fit. As for the famous land swap by which Israel
magnanimously gives up a little bit of the Negev desert for the choicest bits of the West
Bank, Clinton overlooks the fact that that particular Negev area earmarked by Israel also
just happens to have been used by it as a toxic waste dump! Besides, given the peculiar
divisions cutting up East Jerusalem -- all of which is illegally annexed land anyway
&#150; and the three (instead of four) cantons into which the West Bank territory ceded
conditionally by Israel will be divided, all of what has been described as an American
breakthrough proposal pretty much dissolves. What the Palestinians are left with are
material sacrifices, which make Israeli &quot;concessions&quot; look like child's play. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The sacrifices demanded by Clinton are of course a cancellation of the
Palestinian right of return for refugees and, just as great, a Palestinian declaration of
the end of the conflict with Israel. First of all, the right of return for refugees (the
right to a secure life in a place of one's choice) is a right guaranteed not just by UN
resolutions but by the Charter of the UN and the Universal Declaration of Human Rights.
Clinton's formula for getting round this little problem reveals the man's approach to the
world: &quot;I believe we need to adopt a formulation on the right of return that will
make clear that there is no specific right of return to Israel itself but does not negate
the aspiration of the Palestinian people to return to the area.&quot; To which area? Iraq,
Jordan, and Syria, for example, can easily be described as belonging to &quot;the
area.&quot; Who does Clinton think he is fooling? So then, why purposely and transparently
try to confuse Palestinians with the phrase &quot;the area&quot; if what is actually meant
is not allowing them a right to return to the country from which they were in fact driven?
</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As Clinton well knows (he is a lawyer by training) there can be no
negotiation at all when it comes to human rights; according to the very laws the US
pretends to uphold when it bombs some defenseless country like Sudan or post-Gulf War
Iraq, no one can therefore either modify or negate any of the major human rights. Moreover
it is impossible, for example, to uphold rights against discrimination or against the
right to work in some cases and not in others. Basic human rights are not elements of a
menu, to be chosen or rejected at will: they are meant to have the stability of universal
acceptance, especially by charter members of the UN. Granted, the implementation of rights
is always a major problem, but that has nothing to do with the fact that as rights they
exist whether or not they are implemented, and therefore cannot be abrogated, modified or,
as Clinton seems to think, re-formulated. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similarly, the right to choose one's place of residence as a refugee: that
too is unalienable and non-negotiable. Neither Arafat, nor Clinton, nor certainly Barak
has any right at all to tamper with the right, nor to attempt by crude bamboozling to
&quot;reformulate&quot; it in a way that suits Israel or renounces it in any way. Why must
Israel always be an exception and why must Palestinians always be required to accept
things that no people have ever been asked to accept before them? It seems to me indecent
for Clinton to have gone to war, dragging all of NATO with him and destroying Serbia in
the process, on behalf of the Kosovo Albanian right of return, and then ask Palestinians
to renounce theirs. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A second point here is to recall that Israel, which with unremitting
obduracy continues to deny any responsibility for Palestinian dispossession, maintains an
unchallenged Law of Return for any Jew anywhere. How it can continue to do so and with a
kind of ruffian churlishness refuse even to discuss a similar Palestinian right defies
logic, to say nothing of elementary fairness. There is also the matter of compensation,
not only for the enormous losses of 1948, but for the 33 years of spoliation and
exploitation that have come with the ever-present military occupation. Bill Clinton wants
all that dropped, as if by not mentioning a word about reparations the whole subject would
disappear. It seems condescending to tell Palestinians that Israel will mutter a few words
about understanding or even recognizing their suffering and get off without a single
mention of responsibility. Who is that typically l950s-style propaganda formula supposed
to placate? Israel, or the Jewish Agency? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But Arafat did indeed come to Washington in response to Clinton's
summoning, and because he is who he is, Arafat will probably not refuse or accept
outright. He will waffle, and maneuver, and come and go, will conditionally accept, as
more Palestinians sacrifice their lives and, almost as important, their livelihoods for
nought. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Over the past weeks I have tried in every way available to me to get
Arafat for once in his long domination of Palestinian affairs to address his people
honestly, directly, in a straightforward way. But he persists in silence. And his advisers
and associates also flutter around, powerless to influence him or to come up with anything
by way of alternatives. Yet again I want to say, we need a new kind of leadership, one
that can mobilize and inspire the whole Palestinian nation; we have had enough of flying
visits in and out of Cairo, Rabat and Washington, enough of lies and misleading rhetoric,
enough of corruption and rank incompetence, enough of carrying on at the people's expense,
enough of servility before the Americans, enough of stupid decisions, enough of criminal
bungling and uncertainty. It is clear that no matter what happens now, the Palestinians
will be blamed: unabashed Zionist prophets like Thomas Friedman of the New York Times, who
has not one word of criticism for Israeli brutality and keeps demanding that Arabs must
recognize his &quot;organic&quot; connection as a Jew to Palestine without ever
acknowledging that that right was implemented in conquest and wholesale Palestinian
dispossession, will upbraid for wrecking the peace, and continue broadcasting his
half-truths in the American media. Still, this is all to no avail. Whether he and his
associates like it or not, Israel can only have peace when the Palestinian right is first
acknowledged to have been violated, and when there is apology and remorse where there is
now arrogance and rhetorical bluster. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our first duty as Palestinians is to close this Oslo chapter as
expeditiously as possible and return to our main task, which is to provide ourselves with
a strategy of liberation that is clear in its goals and well defined in practice. For this
we must at some point have the partnership of like-minded Israelis and Diaspora Jews who
understand that you cannot have occupation and dispossession as well as peace with the
Palestinian people. South African Apartheid was defeated only because blacks as well as
whites fought it. That the PLO has long thought that it could make peace with Israel and
somehow tolerate occupation is only one of its numerous strategic as well as tactical
mistakes. A new generation is arising now that no longer respects the old taboos and will
not tolerate the lamentable &quot;flexibility&quot; that has given Palestinian liberation
the status of a question mark rather than that of a beacon of hope. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are two contradictory realities on the ground on which Clinton's
Washington talks will founder. One is that the energies released by the Intifada are not
easily containable in any available form for the foreseeable future: Palestinian protest
at what Oslo has wrought is a protest against all aspects of the status quo. The second
reality is that, whether we like it or not, historical Palestine is now a bi-national
reality suffering the devastation of Apartheid. That must end and an era of freedom for
Arabs and Jews must soon begin. It falls to us to try now to provide the signposts for a
new era. Otherwise it is easy to foresee years more of fruitless and costly struggle. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">E. Yaghi</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Your past is not your potential. In any hour you can choose to
liberate the future.&#148; &#150;Marilyn Ferguson </i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I come in peace. In my hand I hold an olive branch, above me flies the
dove that symbolizes the possibility of a brighter tomorrow for both you and me. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I am the daughter of the ancient Canaanites. My forefathers have been
living on this land you now call yours for thousands of years. There was a time not so
long ago when my people and your people lived together and shared the same dreams. Now
your dreams have become my people&#146;s nightmares. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Your government encourages settlers like you to come and live on my land,
outside of Israel proper. From the hilltops that belong to my people, you take pride in
shooting at my neighbors and me while we farm our land. My small stone house is riddled
with bullet holes. At night my parents and I cannot sleep and my little brothers and
sisters wake up in the dead of night with bouts of screams and their small bodies heavy
with sweat. A few days ago, our neighbor&#146;s daughter was killed at home. She was my
best friend. While she was sleeping, some Israeli soldiers perched on top of the hills
where your settlement is, opened fire on her house. A bullet hit her in her heart and
struck her dead instantly. Even in death she looked beautiful. I spent the rest of that
night crying for my friend Areej. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government encourages settlers like you to live on more and
more of my land and the land of my people. You are exempt from military service, but
receive military training in order to kill us better. You are paid money to exploit us and
to make sure we live in constant fear. Your reprisals against our uprisings are lethal,
swift and without mercy. Inspite of this, the other day my little brother bravely
declared, &#147;The settlers can do what they want to our house. I&#146;m not
leaving.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But my little brother deserves more than a perforated house to live in and
the fate of the pogrom of him and his people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As you sit on top of our occupied hills looking down on us with contempt,
I stare back at you with a multitude of questions spiraling through my mind. I mean you no
harm. Surely you have a wife and children of your own. I wonder where you came from and
why you came here now to take my father&#146;s and my forefather&#146;s land away from my
family and me. Would you like it if someone came and took away your home and shot and
killed your wife and children? Surely a wrong committed against a Gentile is as wrong as
one committed against a Jewish settler. I should not be punished for the suffering of your
people that happened way before I was born. I can&#146;t understand why you hate me and my
people so. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever you and your people may have suffered generations ago is not my
fault. I bear you no malice. I just want to live in peace. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We believe in the same God. Our God is the God of justice and He hates
tyranny and oppression. He would never condone your killing of my people and me so that
you can take our place on the land that is ours. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I urge you to put down your gun and forsake your hate. Let us live in
peace together and build a better tomorrow for the children of the future. A future where
Jewish and Palestinian children will be able to play and laugh together. A future where
you guns will no longer shoot down innocent civilians like my friend Areej. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">You have sold your conscience. Please do not sell your soul. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The sight of a child raising hands in front of the machine gun
toting thug grieves us only if it is a Jewish child. The Gentile child can be shot at
freely.&#148;-Israel Shamir </i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Let&#146;s get one thing straight from the start. I am neither of
Palestinian origin nor from Arab descent. I am an American citizen whose father served in
WWll and whose brother served in Vietnam. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I grew up with the idea that all men are created equal and that all are
entitled to the same inalienable rights of life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.
Such great American movies like &#147;Braveheart&#148; and &#147;The Patriot&#148; have
always inspired me for they symbolize man&#146;s quest for freedom. Both these movies were
about courageous men who fought for the liberty of their countrymen and fought against the
oppression of the despots that ruled them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our own forefathers fought with dauntless determination to free the
colonists from unfair taxes and no representation and to liberate America from foreign
domination and British rule. Our Declaration of Independence on July 4, 1776, was an
eloquent proclamation of our independence from Great Britain. Many colonists fearlessly
gave their lives so that they could guarantee independence from British rule forever. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A little later in our history, Americans fought the Civil War to free the
slaves. We freed them on paper, but it was not until the Civil Rights movement when such
people as Rosa Parks was arrested in 1955, because she dared to disobey a segregation law
in Montgomery, Alabama that required her to give up her seat on a bust to a white person,
that Americans began to free Afro-Americans in reality. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In 1961 Freedom Riders, both black and white, traveled around the South in
buses to test the effectiveness of desegregation of interstate bus stations. The Freedom
Riders did desegregate some bus stations, but even more importantly, they demonstrated how
far civil rights workers would go to achieve their goals and to resist the violence of
those who opposed them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And though we Americans have not always been initially fair to our native
Indians or to the Afro-Americans, much has been done throughout our history to redress the
wrongs that we committed. Today, America is a democracy for all its citizens regardless of
ethnic affiliations. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">How then, can we as Americans, dedicated to the ideals of freedom and
democracy be so biased when it comes to what is happening between the Palestinians and the
Israelis? Until 1948, Palestine was Palestinian and had been Palestinian for 2000 years.
But after World War ll, aided by Zionists and the guilty conscience of the British and
Americans, European Jews began a massive migration to Palestine. By use of force, terror
and massacres such as Deir Yessin where a whole Palestinian village of unarmed civilians
was wiped out by Jewish terror groups like the Haganah, Irgun and Stern gangs, the
indigenous inhabitants of Palestine were thus liquated or driven out to other parts of
Palestine or to neighboring Arab countries. Today, there are about 8 million Palestinian
refugees in the Palestinian Diaspora, waiting to return to their homes. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fact that Jews were persecuted in Europe and elsewhere is not the
fault of the Palestinians and they should not have to pay for the crimes of others, nor
should they be evicted from their own land by some of the very people who suffered
persecution elsewhere. Prior to 1948, Arabs and Jews were living together peacefully in
Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Throughout our American media, Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak is made
to look generous when he offers to share the remaining 22% of original Palestine with the
Palestinian people. The Palestinians are made to look violent and ungrateful when they
rise up to protest against the tyranny and oppression from which they suffer. We label
Palestinian freedom fighters as terrorists but we call William Wallace a hero. We also
revere men like George Washington, Thomas Jefferson and Benjamin Franklin because they
dared to speak out and fight against the people who were oppressing them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When we see a Palestinian child courageously throwing a stone at heavily
armed Israeli soldiers, we fail the see the magnitude of what is really happening. This
child is fighting for the freedom of his people and against brutality and extreme
suppression just as our American forefathers did. He is the infant Palestinian David
throwing stones at the Israeli Goliath. Take a look at the casualties. The majority of
dead and injured are Palestinian not Israeli. Israeli soldiers shoot to kill and aim at
the heads and hearts of children. How can we witness such atrocities and not feel guilt or
compassion? Our blind support of the Israelis refutes human logic beyond recognition. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Iraq invaded Kuwait, America led the Allied forces in a brutal
bombing campaign that claimed millions of lives. How then can we justify the occupation of
Palestinian land and the eviction of Palestinians from their homes by Jewish outsiders?
How many Palestinian children must die before we realize that something is dreadfully
wrong? How many Palestinian homes must be bulldozed by Israeli settlers and Israeli
soldiers and how many Palestinian olive trees must be uprooted before we begin to wonder
just who the real terrorists are? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians have the right to live on their own land in peace. The
refugees living in the Palestinian Diaspora should have the option of whether to return or
not to their land and homes that were taken away from them by force. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For now, what is left of Palestine is under siege. The West Bank and Gaza
are not just two isolated islands, but two huge concentration camps full of a people who
have suffered enough. There can only be peace in the Middle East when there is a just,
equitable and comprehensive solution to the plight of the Palestinians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must question the past and appeal to reason. To remain silent or to
isolate ourselves from the truth is our moral failing. We must understand that what is
happening in Palestine right now, today, is a moral, a social and a political wrong. It is
about time that Americans search their hearts and souls about what is happening to the
Palestinian people. They are a noble people. They are the sons and daughters of liberty
and they deserve a fair deal for a change. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Allow me to leave you with the words of the great Israeli writer, Israel
Shamir when he wrote, &#147;We can choose the way of Nineveh, to repent, to return the
stolen property, to give full equality to the Gentiles, to stop discrimination and murder,
and hope to be forgiven by God, if not for our sake, then for the sake of our cats and
dogs. We can persist in our evil ways as the people of Sodom and wait for the flood of
fire and burning sulphur from the angry heavens of Palestine.&#148; <br>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><font color="#0000FF">The Sharon Factor: Israeli Elections Revisited</font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Hanan Ashrawi*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his attempt at reinventing himself, Ariel Sharon, Israel&#146;s Likud
candidate for prime minister in the upcoming February 6 elections, is claiming
supernatural powers&#151;i.e. the ability to accomplish the impossible. <br>
On the one hand, Sharon claims to be able to deliver &#147;peace&#148; with the
Palestinians and with the Arab world while promising, on the other hand, to annex
Palestinian territory, maintain all Israeli settlements, impose Israeli sovereignty over
Jerusalem, totally negate the Palestinian refugees&#146; right of return, and wreak havoc
among the Palestinians should they dare protest. <br>
Thus he seems to suffer from the illusion that he can &#147;offer&#148; less than
Barak&#146;s already unacceptable &#147;offer&#148; and miraculously invent a Palestinian
counterpart who will jump for joy at the chance of relinquishing more Palestinian lands
and rights. <br>
Conceptually, Sharon&#146;s impaired vision seems to discern a non-existent Palestinian
willingness to enter into a new and prolonged interim phase, to continue negotiating ad
absurdum, while Sharon continues to create more facts on the ground pending a distant (not
entirely definite) final agreement. <br>
With the same shortsightedness, Sharon has ruled out disengagement or
&#147;separation&#148; as an option in favor of more fatal &#147;togetherness&#148; in the
unnatural context of settlements, economic dependency, and territorial control. <br>
If Barak (and all previous Israeli governments since 1967) could not contain or digest the
Palestinians wholesale, Sharon seems to think that his voracious appetite is reason enough
for biting off much, much more than he can chew. <br>
The type of apartheid &#147;integration&#148; envisaged by Sharon will eventually lead to
the de facto realization of a bi-national state after a prolonged period of suffering and
bloodshed. <br>
In addition, Sharon&#146;s threat to resort to violence and to the &#147;iron fist&#148;
tactics that have stigmatized his style of decision-making with indelible blood is the
cynical refuge of the politically and morally bankrupt. <br>
He can also ask Barak who is leaving &#147;no stone unturned&#148; in pursuing a brutal
policy of violence on the rampage in his attempts to quash the intifada and batter the
Palestinians into submission&#151;to no avail. <br>
Better yet, Sharon should take a stroll down memory lane himself and reexamine his own
bloodstained record. <br>
What he had failed to accomplish with his notorious &#147;Unit 101&#148; and such
massacres as that of Qibya, or such collective cruelty as the Gaza campaign of 1972, or
the horrific Sabra and Shatilla massacres of 1982, he will undoubtedly fail to achieve in
2001 with &#147;more of the same.&#148; <br>
The situation is pregnant with even greater irony. <br>
Sharon, who had been deemed unfit to hold the post of minister of defense in 1982,
suddenly perceives himself (or is being perceived by a large segment of the Israeli
electorate) to be suited to the post of prime minister. <br>
Sharon, who had brought more shame and disgrace on Israel, its global image and moral
standing, is now claiming the right to lead it towards his type of &#147;peace&#148; and
&#147;security.&#148; <br>
As a military &#147;vigilante&#148; with a record of violations requiring more
investigations than any other &#147;leader,&#148; Sharon is now seeking the opportunity to
take his legacy to its natural conclusion&#151;a needless, wasteful, and tragic war of his
own making. <br>
Ironically also, Sharon is reinventing himself as the &#147;benign grandfatherly
figure&#148; capable of looking after his electorate while he charges straight into
another conflagration of horrendous proportions. <br>
He claims to have &#147;interlocutors&#148; and &#147;counterparts&#148; among the
Palestinians and Arabs&#151;assuming that they had all succumbed to the instant collective
amnesia that seems to have afflicted the Israeli public. <br>
Yet more ironically, Sharon has shifted the terrain of his own campaign to the
&#147;peace-making&#148; territory of his opponent, while Barak seems to be competing on
the Likud terrain of oppression and violence. <br>
Thus each is guaranteed a loss of ground on his own turf without annexing the other&#146;s
territory. <br>
The &#147;kinder, gentler&#148; Sharon that his image-makers and spin-doctors are busy
manufacturing may withstand scrutiny, provided he kept his mouth shut (as his own campaign
managers are asserting). <br>
In the meantime, other extremist members of his camp are having difficulty keeping their
own mouths shut, betraying the thinly-disguised agenda of Sharon&#146;s far right with
threats of doom and gloom. <br>
Avigdor Lieberman from Sharon&#146;s own election team (not to mention the likes of
Rahba&#146;am Ze&#146;evi) leaves little room for conjecture in his declared threats to
plunge the whole region into a new inferno including the bombing of Iran, Egypt, and
Lebanon while destroying Palestinian cities altogether. <br>
One may conclude, then, that the Israeli public is voting for a political ventriloquist, a
war criminal with no history, a braggart with no voice, a leader with no vision, and a
warmonger with no peace agenda. <br>
Ultimately, the Israelis are the ones who will pay the price for the twice-felt shame that
is Sharon. <br>
For the Palestinians, Barak has left us with very little to fear from Sharon in the area
of murder and mayhem. <br>
If peace is far with Barak, it will only become more unattainable with Sharon. <br>
Sharon, however, will bring the added ingredient of universal condemnation and repulsion
that will stigmatize Israel and subject it to closer scrutiny, accountability, and
condemnation. <br>
Regardless of the outcome of elections, no Israeli prime minister can enjoy the
&#147;longevity&#148; of a full term in office given the contradictory nature of the
&#147;mission impossible&#148; that seems to prevail&#151;peace and security on the one
hand, and denial of Palestinian rights on the other. <br>
Until there is genuine clarity of vision within the Israeli body politic and leadership,
Israel (and the region) had better get used to a period of instability, of rapid
government changes, of constant let downs and false promises, of floundering leadership
and loss of direction&#151;in short, a pendulum swinging to both extremes of futility and
frustration. <br>
Peace cannot be tailored to accommodate the power of the occupier and to incorporate
conditions of injustice and victimization created by decades of unaccountable occupation
and oppression. <br>
All aspiring candidates, from whichever party in Israel, would be well advised to glean
the proper lessons from the repeated and rapid failures of their predecessors. <br>
Real separation is that which severs all ties with occupation and its mentality of
domination and acquisition, threat and intimidation. <br>
Real power comes with the empowerment of the Palestinian people and the recognition of the
legitimacy of their rights. <br>
Real leadership is that which is not only capable of reading history, but also of charting
the course of a future unfettered by inequities of the past. <br>
Until then, reality cannot be put on hold and the dynamic of tragic conflict may prove
more powerful than that of hesitant peace. <br>
Sharon&#146;s threat of war (as inherent in his fraudulent peace agenda) may yet be the
most powerful self-fulfilling prophecy. </p>

<p ALIGN="center">Part 17</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><big><font color="#FF0000">The Nature of Gush Emunim Settlements</font></big></p>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Media coverage of Israeli settlements in the Occupied Territories has
primarily focused upon effects on Palestinians and the threat posed to peaceful resolution
of conflict. From the prospective of Jewish fundamentalism the religious settlements
should be viewed from three standpoints: their standing as citadels of messianic ideology
their present and potential influence upon Israeli society and their potential role as the
nuclei of the- new society that messianic leaders want to build.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such discussion must be preceded by two comments concerning the
settlements, as viewed by Israeli society. The first comment is that a great majority of
Israeli citizens, represented by Knesset members, favor Israel&#146;s retaining all
settlements&gt; In early 1999, at least 100 of the 120 Knesset members, including all the
Labor Party members, almost certainly support this position even though minor differences
exist about the form of retention. All Arab Knesset members oppose retaining the
settlements; hence the percentage of Jewish Knesset members in favor is still even greater
than a mere counting might indicate. In Israeli Jewish society, nevertheless, a sharp
popular difference in point of view about settlements still exists. Some small groups on
the left oppose all settlements. More importantly, most Israeli Jews consider it normal
that Jews live in some settlements but abnormal that Jews live in other settlements. This
distinction is usually ignored outside Israel, especially in the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The majority of Israeli Jews regard living in settlements in the
&quot;greater Jerusalem&quot; area as normal. &quot;Greater Jerusalem&quot; is an Israeli
urban and social term, not limited in meaning to the Green Line or to the municipal
borders of Jerusalem, as established during the 1967 annexation. Living in &#147;greater
Jerusalem&#148; means living in a place with bus connections adequate for Jews to travel
by public transportation to Jerusalem for shopping or evening entertainment and to return
home by midnight. In early 1999, more than 250,000 Israeli Jews, about 5 per cent of the
total Israeli population, lived in &quot;greater Jerusalem.&quot; The total population of
all other West Bank, Gaza Strip and Golan Heights settlements is about 100,000. These
100,000 are not solidly grouped in a small area, Closely connected with a big city, but
are divided into many small settlements. Ariel, the largest West Bank settlement outside
of &#147;greater Jerusalem,&#148; for example, has about 15,000 inhabitants; Kiryat Arba
has less than 6000; many settlements have about 100 inhabitants. These numbers show that
the majority of Israeli Jews regard living in those settlements as abnormal and refuse to
settle there. In spite of the money expended and the other forms of support by Israeli
governments for so long a time period, only a small number of Jews have opted to live in
settlements in the occupied territories outside of &quot;greater Jerusalem.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the settlements outside of &quot;greater Jerusalem&quot; another
distinction, constantly made by the Israeli Jewish public, must be noted. Those
settlements whose inhabitants are similar socially and politically to the majority secular
segment of Israeli Jewish society have been and still are viewed differently than are
those settlements whose inhabitants are mostly or totally religious Jews (As previously
stated only 20 per cent of all Israeli Jews are religious.) This is seen in Israeli
election results, reported by the media about every four years for each locality,
including each settlement. In the &quot;greater Jerusalem&quot; settlements, the voting
pattern does not differ from the Jewish average behind the Green Line; in other secular
settlements the pattern is almost the same with only a small tilt to the right. The Labor
and Meretz parties regularly receive good percentages of the total vote. In the religious
settlements, on the other hand, the inhabitants rarely even vote for Likud or other right
wing secular parties; they vote instead for religious parties and quite often only for the
NRP. In Kiryat Arba in the 1992 elections, for example, the four largest secular parties
-Labor, Likud, Meretz and Tsomet- received altogether less than 5 per cent of the vote.
Nationally, those parties together received about 80 per cent of the national vote. In the
1996 election the Likud vote in Kiryat Arba rose to 24.4 per cent because of Netanyahu's
promises; in the separate vote for prime minister that year Netanyahu received 96.3 per
cent and Peres only 3.6 per cent. (In the national vote for prime minister that year
Netanyahu received 50.1 per cent and Peres 49.3 percent.) Beit El B is a typical smaller
religious settlement in which Netanyahu received 99.6 per cent of the prime minister's
vote in 1996 to only 0.3 per cent for Peres. In the Knesset election that same year in
Beit El B, the NRP received 76.4 per cent and Moledet, the most right wing party
represented in the Knesset, with strong religious tendencies, received 14.5 per cent.
Thus, NRP and Moledet, the two parties that garnered together 11 of the 120 Knesset seats
or 9.1 per cent in 1996, received 90 per cent of the Beit El B vote. In contrast, in the
secular settlement, Alfey Menashe, Netanyahu received 71.5 per cent and Peres 28.4 per
cent of the vote.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most exposed and isolated settlements are those inhabited by religious
settlers. Although largely ignored by the media outside of Israel, this is a significant
fact. In these exposed and isolated settlements, only religious messianic Jews are
prepared to settle. To a greater extent, this has been the major reason why all Israeli
governments have supported the religious messianic settlements regardless of how the
inhabitants there have voted. Netzarim, situated in the middle of the Gaza Strip, is a
good example of these settlements. To the north of Netzrarim is Gaza City, to the south,
some of the largest refugee camps. Each conglomeration has about 200,000 inhabitants. In
mid 1998, Netzarim had about 120 religious messianic Jewish settler families. (At the time
that the Oslo agreement was signed, Netzarim had almost 60 families.) Some of the adult
males living in Netzarim spend most of their time studying Talmud. Near Netzarim is an
army base that guards a military road crossing the Gaza Strip from east to west. This
road, which according to the Oslo agreement is under exclusive Israeli control, cuts the
Gaza Strip into two parts. The army base is strategic in controlling Gaza but is
represented to the Israeli Jewish public and to the outside world as necessary to protect
the settlement of Netzarim. Secular, traditional and/or Haredi Jews have not opted to
settle in Netzarim and have given no indications of settling there in the future. Thus,
the Israeli government, wishing to maintain the control of the road, must depend upon the
messianic settlers who are ideologically dedicated to settle in such a place.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Settlements in the Occupied Territories can be correctly understood only
within the context of overall Israeli strategy. The basic concept, held since 1967 by both
Labor and Likud with different degrees of hypocrisy, has been to oppress Palestinians with
maximum efficiency. Maximum efficiency includes minimal number of Jewish forces to achieve
the specific purpose. The major idea is that well-trained Jewish soldiers should to the
greatest extent possible be reserved for any major war with one or more of the Arab
states. Soon after acquiring the Occupied Territories in June, 1967, the Israeli
government seriously considered the &quot;Jordanian option.&quot; This idea was that
Jordanian forces would come to the West Bank to do the necessary job for Israel. The
government of Jordan, however, refused to agree to this plan. Hence, the government of
Israel then devised and instituted the &quot;village leagues,&quot; composed of local
Palestinians who effectively ruled the West Bank for some years with only slight support
of the Israeli army. The Intifada broke the &quot;village leagues.&quot; Both the
&quot;Jordanian option&quot; and the &quot;village leagues&quot; concepts were devised for
the same purpose as was the Oslo process in the 1990s. Prime Minister Rabin clearly
explained that this purpose was to have Palestinians ruled on Israelis' behalf by their
own people. This was to be accomplished without interference from human right
organizations and without Israeli legal hindrances to the arbitrary will of the conquest
regime. The Israeli army, according to this thinking, would be free to concentrate upon
its grand military strategy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli strategy regarding the Gaza Strip and the West Bank in the period
after Oslo was and still is based upon settlements being the foci of Israeli military
power. This strategy can best be described by considering the Gaza Strip, where the
geography is much clearer tan in the West Bank. The Gaza Strip, as clearly seen on
published maps, is criss-crossed by military roads. In keeping with the Cairo Accords,
these military roads remain under exclusive Israeli jurisdiction and are patrolled by the
army, either jointly with Palestinian police or separately. The Israeli army has the legal
right to close any section of these roads to Palestinian traffic, even if the section is
within an area ruled by the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli army uses this right
routinely either when a convoy on route to a settlement is passing or when a decision is
made to embarrass the Palestinian Authority. One of these roads, the Gaza City bypassing
road, traverses the length of the Strip, carefully bypassing the main cities and refugee
camps. Another military road, joined to a strip of land, cuts off the Gaza Strip from
Egypt. Other roads traverse the Gaza Strip from the Israeli border on its east side to the
sea or to the Jewish settlement block (Qatif) on the west. One such road, the Netzarim
road, meets the Gaza City bypassing road at Netzarim, thus rendering Netzarim a
strategically important crossroad. Shortly after the signing of the Oslo Accord, the
Israeli Hebrew press reported that large forces of the border guards and the army were
stationed near Netzarim where a new base had been constructed for them. The official
status of Netzarim allowed Israel to do this legally and to acquire the support of that
part of the Israeli Jewish public that is more devoted to settlements than to army bases.
As the well-known commentator Nahum Barnea quipped: &quot;Had a Netzarim not existed, it
would have been invented.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The overall effect of all these roads is that the Gaza Strip is sliced
into enclaves controlled by the bypassing roads. The role of the Jewish settlements in the
Gaza Strip is to serve as pivots of the road grid. This is devised to ensure more
effectual perpetual Israel control. This new form of control, labelled &quot;control from
the outside&quot; by Rabin and other Labor politicians, allows the army to dominate the
Gaza Strip with only a minor expenditure of forces. This is far preferable to the former
situation in which huge control presence had to be expended for direct patrolling of
cities and refugee camps of the Gaza Strip. The Hebrew press has continually referred to
the earlier form of control as the &quot;control from the inside&quot; and has emphasized
that it was less effective and required more forces than the &quot;control-from the
outside.&quot; Changing from inside to outside control continues to depend upon the grid
of roads which in turn depends upon settlements such as Netzarim. As already stated but
worth repeating, only religious Jews who believe in messianic ideology have been willing
to establish and live in such settlements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The situation in the West Bank, outside the greater Jerusalem, is
geographically more complicated than the Gaza Strip but is essentially based upon the same
principles of &quot;control from the outside.&quot; This control is centered upon a grid
of roads whose foci are the settlements. A few settlements were founded for sentimental
reasons. Ariel Sharon, wanting to provoke the United States Secretary of State James Baker
during his visits to Israel in 1991 and 1992, helped establish these few settlements.
Small groups of fundamentalist Jews, even more extreme than Gush Emunim, also helped
establish these small settlements. Although given prominent media coverage, these
settlements remained relatively insignificant, representing only a small proportion of all
the settlements. Settlements, such as Kiryat Arba and the separate Jewish settlement in
Hebron, have been supported by all Israeli governments primarily for strategic reasons.
Although at times creating smokescreens by making insulting comments about settlers, Prime
Minister Rabin from the time of the Oslo agreement until his death strengthened most of
the settlements, especially those in the West Bank. Yossi Beilin, one of the chief
architects of the Oslo agreement, repeatedly reassured the Israeli public that the Labor
government had not abandoned the settlers. Beilin, as reported in <i>Maariv </i>on
September 27, 1995, rebutted accusations made by Likud members of knesset:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Their most ridiculous accusation is that we have abandoned the settlers.
  The Oslo Accord was delayed for months to guarantee that all the settlers would remain
  intact and that the settlers would have maximum security. This entailed making an immense
  financial investment in them. The situation in the settlements has never been better than
  that created following the Oslo Accord.</p>
