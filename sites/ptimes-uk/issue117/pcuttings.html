    Israeli police officers said in court yesterday that they had been ordered to fire live
    bullets without warning at Arab Israeli demonstrators armed only with slingshots during
    the early stages of the current Palestinian uprising.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The testimony, during Israel's first public review of its forces' actions
    during the uprising, probed one of the most explosive issues of the nearly five-month
    conflict, the deaths last October of 13 Palestinians who were Israeli citizens.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Nearly 400 people in all have died so far in the ongoing uprising, the
    great majority of them Palestinians.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In a packed room at Israel's Supreme Court, five Border Patrol police
    officers testified anonymously from behind a makeshift wooden screen erected to shield
    them from the enraged audience of grieving relatives. In a sign of the intense sensitivity
    over the hearings, 15 security guards stood across the front of the courtroom scanning the
    spectators. </p>

  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Washington Post, 23 February 2001</font> </b><br>
    When Palestinian security men came to arrest a suspected bomb maker in Gaza's Jabalya
    refugee camp recently, they met a defiant response: Scores of young men poured out of the
    Al-Nour Mosque, surged at the police and pelted them with stones.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After firing into the air, the police finally arrested their suspect,
    Hamdi Khalil Sakani, a 17-year-old barber allied with the militant Islamic Resistance
    Movement, or Hamas. But the swelling crowd then marched on a nearby police station and
    stoned it until Sakani was released, local residents said. The siege continued until a
    Hamas activist arrived to help calm the crowd.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Five months into the Palestinian uprising against Israel, incidents like
    the one at Jabalya, in which angry crowds challenge the security forces of Yasser Arafat's
    Palestinian Authority, are said to be occurring more frequently.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Daily Telegraph, 21 February 2001</font></b><br>
    The Israeli army has used &quot;excessive, random or negligent&quot; force against
    Palestinians during the four-month-old uprising and encouraged a &quot;culture of
    impunity&quot; among its soldiers, according to Amnesty International.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In a report released today, the human rights group condemns the policy of
    assassinating Palestinians suspected of attacking Israelis as contrary to international
    law.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">At least 13 Palestinians have been killed under the policy since November.
    The latest was on Monday in the West Bank city of Nablus, where an activist of the
    extremist group Hamas was shot dead as he walked away from a mosque.</p>

    &quot;I feel there is no use in telling anyone what has been happening here tonight. Since
    4.30 we have been under heavy shelling. We tried to hide my nieces behind a cupboard but
    they are babies and cannot sit still. Guess what - we could see our houses being shelled
    on Israeli TV.&quot; Marina Barham of Inad Theatre in Beit Jala on the West Bank was
    sending emails to friends about what was happening to her family.</p>

  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The New York Times, 20 February 2001</font> </b><br>
    An Israeli Arab couple lost control today as a border police officer suspected of fatally
    shooting their son took the witness stand a few feet from them. <br>
    <br>
    Attending the first public hearing into police killings of 13 people during a wave of
    violent protests by Israeli Arabs in October, the grief- stricken parents, Hatem and
    Rushdiyeh Gara, erupted.<br>
    <br>
    &quot;Murderer!&quot; Mrs. Gara shouted in Arabic at the police officer, Rashed Murshid,
    before she collapsed. &quot;You murdered my son!&quot; <br>
    <br>
    ..For many Israeli Arabs, the police shootings, during protests in sympathy with the
    Palestinian uprising, were the climax of decades of discrimination &#151; inadequate
    government funding for their towns and villages, inferior roads and schools, unemployment
    and poverty.</p>

    Israel has just elected a prime minister who, brought before the bar of international
    justice, would surely be judged a war criminal in the class of, say, Ratko Mladic, the
    Bosnian Serb commander as firmly associated with the Srebrenica massacre as General Sharon
    was with that of Sabra and Shatila during the 1982 Israeli invasion of Lebanon. <br>
    <br>
    Sharon calls Yasser Arafat &quot;a murderer and a liar&quot; but, in the run-up to the
    elections, the liberal Israeli press copiously illustrated the deceit and sanguinary
    brutality which have been the twin pillars of his own career. One of his likely coalition
    partners, Avigdor Lieberman, has spoken of burning Beirut and bombing Tehran. Sharon's
    ideas on the furtherance of the peace process make a mockery of it. If any Israeli leader
    ever had the makings of a western villain, the destroyer of US interests in the region, it
    is surely he.<br>
