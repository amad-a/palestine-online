<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Israel Smuggles &quot;Sexual Gum&quot; to
Autonomous Enclave</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- From: Khalid Amayreh (31/5/1997)
</font></i></b></p>

<p> <font SIZE="+1">Palestinian Authority officials have accused Israel of
responsibility for spreading the so-called &quot;sexual gum&quot; among
 young Palestinian women in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to  PA's Food and Drug Board, Israel has been
smuggling for some time defective and hazardous consumer products to the
Occupied Territories, including the lust-arousing chewing gum, which reportedly
cause sexual arousal to female teenagers and infertility to women of child-bearing
years.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The report, published Saturday in major Arabic dailies
in the West Bank, pointed out that seven kinds of elastic gum-like tablets
were discovered of late in retail shops and roadside stands in  several
 Palestinians towns, both in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The report said the product, which didn't bear a  trademark
or any other information pertaining to its manufacturer or exporter, most
likely originated in Israel and was smuggled by &quot;suspicious elements&quot;
and &quot;greed-driven merchants.&quot;   </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">However, according to Nahed al Nakhal, Director-General
of the PA Food and Drug Board, some of the  gum coverings contained a warning
saying &quot;not recommended  for girls below the age of 18.&quot; Other
coverings bear the phrase &quot;made in Spain,&quot; but board officials
dismiss the label as deliberately misleading since it doesn't specify the
name and address of the manufacturer.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Nakhal said it was unlikely that what he called &quot;the
suspicious product&quot; came from abroad, adding that the most likely source
of the gum is Israel.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Nakhal, who holds a Ph.D. in Microbiology, pointed out
that  Israel has always sought to &quot;dump and smuggle all kinds of defective
and potentially dangerous consumer products into the West Bank and the Gaza
Strip.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;They seek to achieve two sinister goals,  harming
 the Palestinian people and making  money doing that,&quot; said Nakhal.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last year, samples of the &quot;sexual gum&quot; were taken
to Egypt for thorough analysis, and the results showed that the gum contained,
inter alia,  the progesterone hormone, a steroid hormone that induces sexual
arousal in women. Higher levels of progesterone, however, could cause infertility
to married women.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Palestinians have always suspected that the Israelis were
after something wicked to control their high birth rates, mainly as a way
to keep the Palestinians in a permanent numerical status.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Palestinian printed and electronic media have treated
the subject with ample attention, warning young girls to be careful.  Moreover,
School principals throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip  have been
 exhorted to educate school girls on the matter, in the hope of increasing
public awareness of this matter of paramount significance to the Palestinians.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Far from denying Palestinian charges,  Israeli officials
make no secret of their anxiety at the &quot;worrying levels&quot; of Palestinian
population growth due to a combination of  high birth rates and improved
health care</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last week, Jerusalem mayor, Ehud Olmert, said unashamedly
at a press conference that he was disturbed by the increase of Arab population
in Jerusalem, saying that &quot;this problem  neutralized our continuous
efforts to reduce Arab population to 'manageable' proportions.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Similar racist remarks were uttered virtually by most Israeli
officials, including, first and foremost, Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Last month, the Israeli human rights organization, B'tselem,
published a report entitled &quot;The Quiet Deportation&quot; detailing
frenzied Israeli efforts and measures, including especially-promulgated
laws, to restrict and reduce the Palestinian population in East Jerusalem.
</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The report pointed out that official Israeli policy against
the Palestinians in Jerusalem amounted to &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Indeed, if the Israelis were indeed behind this &quot;gum
scam,&quot; and all indications say they are, it would mean that the Israeli
intelligence services (the likely mastermind of something of this nature)
would be indulging in a crime of genocide proportions.   </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">&quot;Hospital&quot; or &quot;Place of Torture&quot;</font></h3>

<p>  <b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- From Khalid Amayreh (30/5/1997)</font></i></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Khalid Ayesh Abu Dayyeh, 37, who died  on 16 May of brain
hemorrhage at West Jerusalem's Share T'zedek hospital , was not the first
Palestinian to die of torture at an Israeli hospital. However, the circumstances
surrounding his death provided a fresh testimony to the utter savagery and
bestiality with which Palestinians detainees are routinely maltreated at
the hands of Israeli interrogators. Abu Dayyeh was actually beaten to death
&quot;inside the hospital&quot; where he was supposed to receive treatment.
Hence, rather paradoxically, the very people who were supposed to provide
medical care for him, killed the helpless Palestinian deliberately, by beating
him on the head until he was no longer alive.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Khalid's fatal saga began on 4 May when he headed for the
Al Aksa Mosque for prayer.  There at the Mosque's entrance,  he was stopped
by four Israeli soldiers who started making sarcastic and obscene remarks
about Islam and the Prophet Muhammed.  According to his mother, Khalid (a
practicing Muslim) could not bear hear the Jews mock Islam's Holy Book and
Prophet. And as he sought o defend his religion's dignity (verbally), the
four soldiers attacked him savagely, handcuffed him, and took him to the
notorious Russian Compound detention center, often referred to by Palestinian
detainees as the &quot;butchery of the Shabak.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">There Khalid was reportedly subjected to various forms
of severe torture, particularly beatings.  Consequently, Khalid sustained
serious injury in the neck which necessitated his transfer to the Share
T'zedek hospital in West Jerusalem. Khalid had called his mother shortly
before he was taken to the hospital. He told her &quot;not to worry&quot;
and that he would be released in  a few days. But that was the last time
she heard his voice.  Khalid died almost immediately after he arrived at
the hospital. </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The Israeli authorities initially sought to evade responsibility
for his death. An Israeli Prison Authority spokesman claimed on 18 May that
Abu Dayyeh &quot;committed suicide at Share T'zedek, &quot; adding that
he had psychological problems, a charge vehemently denied by is family.
However when an unidentified sanitary worker at the hospital intimated to
the press the circumstances of Khalid's death, the Israeli spokesman was
forced to  abandon the &quot;suicide story,&quot; stating that &quot;the
matter is being investigated.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">According to Khalid's mother, the same eyewitness informed
the family that the border policemen who accompanied her son the hospital
provoked him and sought to humiliate him by cursing his &quot;religion and
Prophet.&quot; (deriding  Islam, the Prophet Muhammed, and the Holy Qura'an
lately became a widespread practice in Israeli jails and detention centers).
Khalid, the eyewitness continued, screamed at them &quot;stop, stop, stop,&quot;
and sought to disentangle  himself  from their grip. Watching the site,
hospital personnel, including several sentries, leapt on Khalid, beating
him savagely on the head, using hand fists and unidentified objects until
he lost consciousness. Khalid was pronounced dead two hours later. An autopsy
on his body revealed that he died of brain hemorrhage caused by &quot;external
blow to the head.&quot;  </font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Khalid's mother and bereaved wife expressed utter distrust
in Israeli promises to establish the facts of  his death.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;First they murdered my son cold-bloodedly, second
they tried to cover up their crime, and now they tell us to trust them to
carry out a fair investigation into what happened,&quot; his mother said.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;God will take our revenge,&quot; his wife added in
sad serenity.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">On 22 May, Khalid was buried in Bethlehem, to be added
to the long list of Palestinian victims of Israeli torture and oppression.</font></p>

</font></h3>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">to Al Aksa Mosque and Jerusalem</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem- PT- 18/5/97</font></i></b></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Thousands of mainly Islamist students at al Najah National
University in Nablus vowed on 17 May to fight and die for the sake of al
Aksa Mosque and al Quds al Sharif (Jerusalem).</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The students who attended &quot;the Jerusalem Loyalty Rally&quot;
shouted in unison &quot;Jerusalem in our hearts,&quot; and &quot;with Soul
and Blood we shall recover al Masjidul Aksa.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">At one point during the rally, 12 students draped in white
robes, symbolizing readiness for martyrdom, mounted the large podium, holding
aloft copies of the Holy Quran and vowing to give what it takes to recover
the world's third most sacred Islamic Shrine from Jewish occupiers.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">The huge audience shouted &quot;God is Great&quot; as Islamist
leader Musa Abu Marzook spoke to them via telephone from Amman where he
now lives following his deportation from the United States earlier this
month.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Abu Marzook commended the Islamist students for &quot;defending
Muslim rights in Palestine.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;You are defending al Quds al Sharif on behalf of
the Muslim Umma...We proudly follow your resistance against the colonization
of our land and the Judaization of our most beloved city, Jerusalem,&quot;
Abu Marzook through a huge loudspeaker.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Jamal Mansur, a prominent Islamist leaders from
Nablus, attacked Israel, the PA and the peace process which he labeled as
&quot;a conspiracy against our people fabricated by Israel, the United States
and defeatist Arab regimes.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Mansur suggested that the PA learn the right lesson from
Hizbullah in Southern Lebanon and how the Islamic Resistance there has forced
Israel to seek a way out of Lebanon.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">&quot;We call on the PA to reconsider the entire path of
Oslo, especially in light of Zionist arrogance and intransigence,&quot;
the Islamist leader said, as several PA policemen listened attentively.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Elsewhere, Islamist leaders repeated their invitation to
the Palestinian authority to seek other alternatives to the deadlocked peace
process.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">At the Islamic University of Gaza, pro-Hamas students organized
a huge rally on 17 May in solidarity with jailed Hamas leader Sheikh Ahmed
Yasin.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Sheikh Ismael Abu Shanab exhorted the PA to follow Yasin's
footsteps (who despite his nearly complete paralysis, refused to budge to
Israeli blackmail.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Observers in the occupied territories believe the Islamist
movements, especially Hamas, have regained and even increased their strength
throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip, especially in light of the
stalemated political process and the dismal performance of the Palestinian
authority in virtually all spheres of Palestinian life.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font SIZE="+2">Crocodile kills Shekaki's killer</font></h3>

<p><b><i><font SIZE="+1">Occupied Jerusalem</font></i></b>- 16/5/97</p>

<p>Shaul Robin, the Mossad agent believed to be responsible for the assassination
of Palestinian Islamic Jihad leader Fathi Shekaki in Malta on 28 October
1995, was reportedly killed by a ferocious crocodile at a Costa Rican beach
recently while vacationing there.</p>

<p>Robin was also implicated in the killing of several Palestinian activists,
while serving in the notorious Israeli General Security Service (the Shabak)
during the late years of the Intifada.</p>

<p>According to the Hebrew Press, a ferocious crocodile attacked Robin while
swimming at a Costa Rican beach, killing him instantly. Israeli Hebrew papers
reported on 11 May that Costa Rican life guards failed to &quot;pull Robin
from the crocodile jaws.&quot;</p>

<p>The papers quoted Israeli military sources as saying that Robin &quot;had
a long arm&quot; in &quot;liquidating&quot; a number of Palestinian and
Lebanese freedom fighters, including Islamic Jiahd leader Fathi Shekaki.</p>

<p>The same sources also revealed that Robin was &quot; a high-ranking officer&quot;
in the undercover death unit known as &quot;Duvidan&quot; which operated
in the Gaza Strip between 1989-1994, and later in the death unit &quot;Samson&quot;
in the West Bank.</p>

<p>Following the Oslo Accords, Robin was transferred to an elite Mossad
unit which operated in Southern Lebanon and was instructed to assassinate
Lebanese resistance leaders and carry out acts of vandalism and terrorism
against Hizbullah fighters and leaders.</p>

<p>Israeli officials have so far declined to elaborate on Robin's death.</p>

<p>Asked to confirm or deny press reports on Robin's death, an Israeli army
spokesman refused to comment on the reports, saying &quot;it is not our
policy to publicly comment on reports of this nature.&quot; <br>

<p><font SIZE="+1">Israeli Prime Minister Benyamin Netanyahu said it would
take some time before a U.S. envoy would get Israel and the Palestinian
Authority (PA) to talk peace again. The Israeli leader also said he was
proud of his decision that sent bulldozers to carve out a new Jewish settlement
in Arab East Jerusalem. &quot;I am proud that I approved the building in
Jerusalem which clarified to the entire world our commitment to the unity
of the city,&quot; said the Israeli Prime Minister.</font></p>

<p><font SIZE="+1">He dismissed the idea the settlement stopped peace-making.
&quot;No process was stopped. If that stopped the process, there is no process,&quot;
