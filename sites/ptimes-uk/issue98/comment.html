</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ehud Barak, the new Israeli Prime Minister, is leaving no allusion as to
his real policy and perception as to the final status settlement with the Palestinians
which, presumably, would end 100 years of conflict and enmity between Arabs and Jews. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his recent maiden visit to Washington as premier of the Zionist regime,
Barak spelled out his vision for the final resolution of the Palestinian question. While
he said he was not particularly opposed to the establishment of a Palestinian entity
(which the Palestinians can call a State), he did declare, rather emphatically, a set of
NOs he said wouldn't be subject to fudge and compromise diplomacy. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These include:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Retaining Jerusalem as Israel's &quot;eternal and divided capital&quot;;</li>
  <li>No return to the 1967 borders;</li>
  <li>Maintaining the bulk of Jewish settlements in clusters under Israeli sovereignty. </li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, what Barak has in mind is a plan to partition the West
Bank whereby Yasser Arafat would get 50%-60% of the occupied territory while Israel would
retain the rest, including, of course, East Jerusalem, the settlements and the strategic
plateau extending along most or all of the Jordan Valley.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Putting land issues aside, Barak also stressed that Israel wouldn't accept
under any circumstances the repatriation of Palestinian refugees who were expelled from
their homeland at gunpoint when Israel was born 50 years ago. The return of refugees, he
said, was unthinkable as far as Israel is concerned.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So where would as many as four million refugees now dispersed to the Four
Corners of the world go? Should they, for example, be forced to be assimilated in host
countries? Or perhaps redistributed around the globe from Australia to Alaska? Or, would
the United States propose to settle them in the American mid-West or perhaps in Alaska? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Obviously, Barak would rather see the refugees, or the vast majority of
them, settled in Lebanon, Jordan or other countries, or maybe in the Sinai Peninsula as
some Israeli and American Zionists have suggested. Barak would not eventually oppose the
return of several thousand refugees to the would-be-created Palestinian entity in the West
Bank, but not to their ancestral homeland in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is quite possible that Barak thinks that a hanky panky solution as such
can be forced on the Palestinians, especially on the obsequious and senile Palestinian
leadership. And he may be right in thinking that a demoralized PA leadership will even
accept the crumb that is thrown to it. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Barak may think that a combination of carrot-and-stick tactics,
coupled with the spinning machine of American-Israeli propaganda, may cajole many
Palestinians, especially the hangers-on and money-grabbing careerists around Arafat, to
laud &quot;whatever is given them because one lark in the hand is worth ten on the
branch..!!</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Arafat, an old man who is said to be desperate to achieve
&quot;peace&quot; by hook or by crook, would likely cajole many Palestinians into
accepting &quot;what can be realistically achieved in this historical episode that is by
no means favorite to the Palestinians.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, indeed, could happen, as little resistance, if any, can be expected
from this disastrous PLO leadership, which accords utmost attention to empty symbols such
as presidential titles and trappings, stately receptions and resonant names, all at the
expense of substance and real, tangible rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, Israel, the United States, and the rest of the international
community should have no illusion about the durability and the stability of this
concocted, fabricated sham deal.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, some vanquished Palestinians may be forced under duress to utter a
reluctant and begrudging &#147;yes&#148; to an imposed settlement as such, given the
Zionist hegemony in the United States. It is a given that peace will be anything but
stable, durable or accepted by the hundreds of millions of Palestinian, Arab and Muslim
masses, who feel robbed of their historical rights and holy shrines, in international
political games to which they had no part. </p>
<font FACE="Times New Roman">

<p ALIGN="LEFT"></font>A peace imposed by force will only last for as long as the force is
there, and once it is no longer there, the suppressed grievances will resurface again.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the Zionists should realize that the Palestinian people will not
be answerable or responsible to a person known as Yasser Arafat, particularly if he signs
a dictated deal that doesn't achieve Palestinian rights in full. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the Palestinian people, whether those still living within
historic Palestine or in the Diaspora, will not be bound by any agreement that may be
signed by Arafat that doesn't restore Palestinian rights. </p>
