    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A proposal to break the deadlock over Jerusalem's Jewish and Muslim holy
    sites by putting them under United Nations sovereignty is being discussed anew by the
    United States, France, Egypt, and UN Secretary General Kofi Annan, according to press
    reports and a Western diplomat close to the peace process.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The proposal calls for a 35-acre plot of land in Jerusalem's Old City -
    referred to by Jews as the Temple Mount and Muslims as the Noble Sanctuary - to be placed
    under the legal authority of the UN Security Council.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">One diplomatic source said Israel is considered likely to accept the
    proposal as a way around the current stalemate in the Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, and
    has been working back channels to push it forward.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Independent (UK), 23 September 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Who is a Jew? It is one of the most divisive questions facing the
    52-year-old state of Israel. And now the battle lines are being drawn in a fresh attempt
    to settle it. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The issue is rooted in a massive wave of immigration which has seen the
    arrival of a million people since 1989, an astonishing number for a country just over a
    quarter the size of Scotland. Three out of every four of the newcomers are from the former
    Soviet Union. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Almost a sixth of the 6.1 million population are Russian speakers, whose
    presence is changing the character of Israel and intensifying tensions between the secular
    majority and its fundamentalist religious opponents. Indeed, the scale of the Russian
    influx is now prompting calls for reform of the historic law which allows anyone to
    immigrate if they have a Jewish grandparent.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Chicago Tribune, 22 September 2000</font> </b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian leader Yasser Arafat is willing to trade land in the West Bank
    for territory in Israel, a swap aiming to accommodate Jewish settlers, a U.S. Jewish
    leader who met with him said Thursday.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel and the Palestinians are waiting for the United States to decide
    whether to offer bridging proposals to break the logjam in their negotiations, officials
    from both sides said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The talks are deadlocked over control of holy sites in Jerusalem, though
    other key issues, including Palestinian refugees, and Jewish settlements and borders, have
    not been resolved.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat is committed to reaching an agreement, but &quot;hasn't decided on
    what to sign, when to sign,&quot; said Abraham Foxman, national director of the
    Anti-Defamation League, an American Jewish group, who met with Arafat late Wednesday.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Financial Times, 22 September 2000 </font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After seven years of acrimonious negotiations Israel and the Palestinians
    on Thursday announced they had finally reached agreement to start building a seaport in
    the Gaza Strip. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The agreement, signed between Gilad Sher, Israel's chief peace negotiator,
    and Saeb Erekat, his Palestinian counterpart, ended years of missed deadlines,
    disagreements over security arrangements and concern over the environmental impact. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The two sides have now agreed that Israel will have a role in checking
    cargo at the port. It is unclear if all incoming and outgoing cargo will be examined.
    Israel already monitors aircraft landing at the Gaza airport and has access to the
    passenger lists.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The New York Times, 20 September 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel canceled a scheduled meeting with Palestinian negotiators today,
    raising concerns that the fragile peace effort had reached another potential breaking
    point. But by day's end, the Israelis had arranged another meeting for Wednesday.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">After the first cancellation, Palestinian negotiators quickly condemned
    the Israelis for what they described as an indefinite suspension of negotiations, saying
    the move put in question Israel's commitment to the peace effort.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;This is a regrettable decision that shows that the Israeli
    government is trying to prepare for itself a path out of the peace process,&quot; said
    Saeb Erekat, a senior negotiator.</p>
  </li>
  <li><b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Los Angeles Times, 17 September 2000</font></b></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">When the Palestinian Central Council last week postponed, once again, the
    decision to unilaterally declare an independent state, few Palestinians seemed disturbed.
    Palestinians, one may conclude, have grown too cynical to place any faith in what the
    Palestinian Authority promises, so they are not holding their breath for the new deadline,
    set for mid-November. What makes many of them take such dates lightly is not merely the
    long record of postponements but also the solid belief that the Palestinians would gain
    little if they went independent without first having an agreement with Israel. After all,
    the Palestinian Authority controls only small chunks of territory in the West Bank, and
    Israel would have the overwhelming upper hand if military conflict broke out between them.
    So how credible is the November deadline?</p>
