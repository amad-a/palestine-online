<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Sovereignty over Jerusalem: Issues of concern</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Muqtedar Khan*</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The only reason why Israel is willing to even
consider making any concessions for peace at this moment is because it expects to get the
best possible outcome now. The balance of power between Israel and the Arabs is decisively
in Israel&#146;s favour. The honest broker&#150;Uncle Sam&#150;is firmly in Israel&#146;s
pocket. With the disappearance of the Soviet Union, the Arabs have no one to turn to. The
Arabs in general and the Palestinians in particular can neither threaten Israel with
&#147;dire consequences&#148; nor promise any major benefits in the post peace scenario.
They can only remain a nuisance value to Israel and constantly spoil its victory parties.
Israelis have realized that while they may make peace with governments, peace within the
peoples is too far away to even feature as a factor during the negotiations.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Israel has achieved nearly all its goals! A Jewish
State has been firmly planted in the heart of the Arab world. All members of the Arab
world have explicitly or tacitly acknowledged and accepted the Jewish State. Except for a
few organizations such as the Muslim Brotherhood and militias such as Hamas that Arab
governments are determined to marginalize, no one anymore challenges the existence of
Israel or rejects its colonial origins. Israel now has more land than it had wanted and
also has significant assets, such as the Golan Heights and the West Bank and Gaza, that it
can bargain away for peace. Israel, with its state-of-the-art technology and having the
richest economy in the region as well as a monopoly over nuclear weapons, can now think of
standing on its own even in its tough neighbourhood. And it has complete control over
Jerusalem&#150;its so-called eternal and undivided capital&#150;in its entirety!</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">So why does it want to talk peace and why even
suggest its willingness to share Jerusalem? There are several reasons. Any change in the
region with regard to distribution of power or economic wealth will probably be at
Israel&#146;s expense. Israel is at its zenith and the Arabs are at their nadir. Things
can only get better for the Arabs and worse for Israel. So negotiated peace can result in
very favourable circumstances for Israel. Israel also realizes that with the eternal
control over Jerusalem comes the eternal enmity of Arabs/Muslims. In the entire history of
Islam, enemies of Islam have never succeeded in taking and keeping Jerusalem from Muslims
for more than 70 years. History clearly suggests that the odds are against Israel&#146;s
keeping Jerusalem through force.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The growth of Islam in the U.S. and the West is
another consideration. Slowly the balance of power in the sense of leverage over Western
foreign policies is moving in the direction of Muslims and will certainly reduce Jewish
control over Western policies in the Middle East. So it is best that Israel makes peace
now and forever eliminate the so-called Islamic threat and keep the gains it has made in
the last 50 years.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Now that we understand why Israel is willing to make
peace, let us consider issues with regards to sharing sovereignty over Jerusalem. There
are two issues that Arafat and his aides must focus on. They are the extent and content of
sovereignty. What does Israel mean by &#147;sharing&#148; and what does Israel mean by
&#147;Jerusalem&#148;?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Sharing control can imply spatial/geographical
division of East Jerusalem with each party enjoying complete and exclusive control over
the divided regions. But then this would mean &#147;dividing&#148; Jerusalem. Is this what
Israel is willing to concede? I don&#146;t think so. They are suggesting sharing
governance over some designated areas. While Israel will have complete and exclusive
control over most of Jerusalem, some areas will be designated as Arab Jerusalem and will
become the capital of Palestine. Arafat and his cronies will have &#147;control over some
aspects&#148;, such as municipal issues and law and order, and they will be allowed to
have their offices there. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Will foreign embassies to Palestine be allowed to
have their offices in Jerusalem? This is not clear. Will the Israeli army have the right
to enter the area to hunt Hamas activists? Not clear.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">I believe that Israel will not concede
&#147;exclusive control&#148; over any space or issue of Jerusalem to Palestine. They are
merely looking for some &#147;vague concept&#148; that will enable the Arab leaders to
build upon using the rich language of Arabic to save their defeated and pathetic faces.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">As a Muslim, who is neither an Arab nor a
Palestinian, I am neither interested in Palestinian &#147;nationalism&#148; or &#147;Arab
pride&#148;. I personally believe that once free of Israel and into the &#147;clutches of
Arafat&#148;, the people of Palestine will have less freedom to practice Islam and more
pressure to worship him and his ruthless State. There is no reason why one should expect a
free Palestine to be more Islamic or more democratic than any of the other present-day
Arab regimes. I am also convinced that &#147;Arabism&#148; and
&#147;nationalism&#148;&#150;two ideas nurtured by colonial interests and Arab Christians
and Arab socialists&#150;are the biggest enemies of Islam in the region and responsible
for its current pathetic state, so beautifully captured by the cameras when Barak was seen
physically herding and pushing Arafat into the slaughterhouse as Clinton watched and
waited.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">I am interested in Baitul Maqdas: the Islamic holy
site, not the city or the State. Who gets to keep it and then what happens? Who do I have
to pay hundreds of dollars to in order to go to the place I revere out of love for my
Prophet and my submission to my God? And, of course, be treated like an animal while on
pilgrimage. But that is another story. Meanwhile, we wish that Arafat emerges with some
real control over Baitul Maqdas and all the important mosques, not just some suburbs of
East Jerusalem. The optimists among us should feel free to line up outside wherever
Palestine will have its embassy for a &#147;visa&#148; to get Arafat&#146;s permission to
go and pray in Masjid Al-Aqsa and to celebrate its return to true Muslim control while the
cynics ponder over how Muslim will Arafat&#146;s control over these places be.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">It&#146;s not a question of legality!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Dr. Musil Shihada</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">There are no legal bases that can support the
existence of Israel: no Biblical myths, no Balfour Declarations, no dispositions by the
League of Nations or even United Nations resolutions 181 and 194. The Biblical
argument&#150;if taken seriously&#150;would grant the seed of Abraham all the areas
between the two great rivers: the Nile and the Euphrates (Genesis 15:18). This claim is so
preposterous given that it would necessitate the relinquishing of all the countries
between the two great rivers, consequently causing an additional 100 million Arab refugees
having to join the Palestinian refugees in places only God knows where. The Balfour
Declaration and subsequently the League of Nations (1922) exemplifies the apex of travesty
when the British, who were assigned as a trustee to Palestine, gave away land that did not
belong to the donor in the first place. The UN contravenes its own charter when it
involves itself in partitioning a country between two disputants when such an act is
beyond the jurisdiction of the international organization. Even then its resolution could
not have been binding since it was approved under Western pressure in the General Assembly
and not the Security Council. If one seeks other international conferences such as Geneva
and The Hague, one would find that it would be a crime to dispossess or evict anybody from
his home or property, which Israel has flagrantly violated. Therefore, Israel has no legal
status at all if all international laws, conventions and charters were to be researched.
To avoid being called an outlaw State and to keep its image unblemished in the eyes of the
world, Israel still clings to an artificial thread of legality by insisting that the UN,
in accordance with resolution 181, created it. If we were to entertain such a position,
Israel would still have problems because it has flagrantly violated the very resolution
that created it. The resolution prohibited the expulsion of anyone from either State to
the other, and it certainly made it illegal to seize somebody else&#146;s land by the use
of force. Had Israel abided by the exact implementation of the UN resolution, we would
have, at least, avoided the emergence of the tragic refugee problem. The semi-legality of
the existence of Israel is therefore directly related to the emergence of the State of
Palestine. What else would the Partition mean? To implement half of UN resolution 181 and
violate the other half negates the legality of the whole resolution. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Therefore, we should realize that Israel&#146;s
existence on our land is not a question of legality as much as an illegal fait accompli
realized through the use of force while supported by the Western powers. All subsequent UN
missions directed at Israel in trying to rectify its violations of all such international
legality have been practices in futility. In May 1949 at Lusanne, Israel accepted the
principle of peace with the Arab delegations by promising to implement the UN Partition in
its entirety while allowing the Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and
properties in accordance with resolution 194. Such conditions were proposed by the French
delegate to the Lusanne conference and were supported by the United States as
pre-requisites to its admission to UN membership. Once Israel was finally admitted to the
UN, it reneged on its commitments, and the following 50 years witnessed all kinds of
turmoil, wars and violence to make Israel honour its commitments under the UN regulations.
It&#146;s no secret that Israel has declared more than once that it cannot withdraw from
occupied Arab territory nor will it honour UN resolutions supporting the return of the
refugees. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">After the Intifadah and the subsequent Oslo accords,
Israel did not change its policy one iota vis-à-vis its withdrawal from the occupied
lands or the right of return of the Palestinian refugees. Therefore, no one in his right
mind should expect Israel to negotiate peace with the Palestinians based on international
legality as legality would downsize Israel to unacceptable land allotments while diluting
its Jewish-ness with the undesired return of non-Jewish Palestinian refugees. By accepting
to implement UN resolutions 181 and 194, Israel would contravene its Jewish exclusivity
over Palestine and render its &#147;security&#148; needs vulnerable and at the mercy of
the surrounding Arab regimes. One then cannot escape from the irritable conclusion that
all peace negotiations&#150;whether in Oslo, Palestine, Sharm El-Sheikh or
Washington&#150;have one thing in common: Israel (the mighty party) can only dictate its
terms of total surrender to the weak and vanquished Palestinian party. No negotiations
will ever succeed between two parties if one is strong and greedy while the other is weak
and desperate. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">If a framework of legality is the basis of any
negotiations, then we should realize that the return of the homeland and the right of
return of the Palestinian refugees are NOT negotiable. These issues are to be resolved
within the demands of international law and not by the moody dispositions of the parties
to the dispute. Maybe a method of implementation should be organized with Israel but not
whether the issues at hand should be placed on the agenda of negotiations. The right of
return is an inherent right and a basic human right that should not be subject to
discussion or any further deliberations. Such important issues should not be left to
public consensus or any party&#146;s opinion. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Any approach that does not place these issues in
their proper framework will render any negotiations a practice in theatrics. No
Palestinian leadership has the right to deliberate on these issues just as no one has the
right to dispose of the land that belonged to our ancestors and should automatically
belong to our next generation. I think it should behoove our leaders in Washington to
simply pack up and leave and start organizing from square one. We should not underestimate
the strength of the Palestinian card. We still hold the future of peace and war in our
hands; we are still the bridge without which Israel could never cross to enter the entire
Arab and Muslim world. We hold the card that can still decide the destiny of Israel and
the whole Middle East. We should never succumb to the might of the oppressor as our
determination can in the long run give us our rights to the land and the repatriation of
our people. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Camp David II: Will Israel try <br>
to fool history, again?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Ramzy Baroud*</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Israel&#146;s overwhelming dominance over the
Palestinian leadership throughout their relatively long negotiation experience is little
contested. The acknowledgment of such a realization, however, can by no means negate the
fact that the Palestinian people, with humble means and scarce meaningful support, have
undoubtedly maintained their ability to survive as a nation with a just cause. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Palestinian struggle goes back many years before
Camp David I and II, as well as Oslo. Yet as conquerors came and departed, leaving behind
devastated land and people, Palestinians stood solidly and patiently repaired the damage
inflicted by their enemies, and with durability tried to heal their wounds and emotional
scars. Israel, another conqueror, which was established where historical Palestine once
stood, foolishly thought that it could trick history into changing its course. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Not as if much had changed since former Israeli
Prime Minister Golda Meir uttered her famous statement, &#147;There is no such thing as a
Palestinian people...It is not as if we came and threw them out and took their country.
They didn&#146;t exist.&#148; Sure, Israel&#146;s politicians nowadays acknowledge the
existence of such people, as if they were suddenly found, but the racist policy, which
Israel was assembled upon, is still in place, highlighted by Barak&#146;s &#147;red
lines&#148;. According to Barak, Palestinians&#146; religious rights, territorial
sovereignty and right of return are largely denied and non-negotiable. If Meir&#146;s
denial of the Palestinians&#146; existence is viewed abstractly, her statement is almost
an exact match to Barak&#146;s red lines (considering that the denial of the most basic
human rights is a denial of existence and vice versa.) </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Based on that shared Israeli belief, the Palestinian
people ought to be removed from the scene at any cost so the Israeli myths could finally
be claimed. What else could explain the expulsion of nearly a million Palestinians in 1948
by Jewish gangs and the killing of numerous numbers of innocent people and courageous
fighters in the process? What could possibly explain the forcing of Palestinians into
scattered and extremely impoverished refugee camps, denied of all rights yet forced to pay
heavy taxes from which the Israeli &#147;defense ministry&#148; purchases weapons used to
suppress the already overpowered refugees? Those Palestinians living outside the Israeli
scope were neither safe from Israel&#146;s reign of terror or extermination philosophy, as
they too received their share of death and devastation. The massacred martyrs of Sabra,
Shatila and Bourj el-Barajneh in Lebanon, and others hunted and killed in Cyprus, Tunisia
and the rest of the world is a clear indication that Israel&#146;s fight was not only
aimed at the land of the Palestinians but at the Palestinian people themselves, no matter
how far from Palestine they may have been.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">But as Israel&#146;s goal was to lay upon the
Palestinian people a destiny like that of the Aborigine of Australia and the native
&#147;Indians&#148; of the Americas, Palestinians appear to be nowhere near cultural
extinction. And as the Palestinian problem ages, as more Palestinian land is confiscated,
and as the number of refugees grows, the battle for justice keeps on raging. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">For Palestinians, resistance has never ceased to be
an option that picks up where &#147;peace&#148; talks fall short. The Palestinians&#146;
fear of the Camp David II outcome is neither a sign of desperation nor does it mark the
end of their journey. Palestinians have always loathed unworthy compromises that fail to
recognize their full rights and that fail to acknowledge their decades of suffering. The
same anxiety experienced now by many Palestinians was once felt as Egypt and Israel
reached a Camp David agreement years ago. Rejection of the agreement turned into a fuel
that prolonged the resistance for years, and Camp David II will not be the exception. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Palestinians, too, have options and strengths,
although they may not be articulated as arrogantly and as viciously as Israel&#146;s.
Unlike what Israel had for so long misunderstood, strength is not only a piling up of
weapons and artillery. Real strength stems from the spirit of justice and one&#146;s
unbendable belief in freedom, a trait that Palestinians will always possess. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#000000">Dr. Daud Abdulla*</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The world&#146;s oldest and most intractable refugee
problem is that of the exiled Palestinians. Since 1948 more than half of the entire
Palestinian population have lived outside of their ancestral land. The immediate cause of
their dispersal was the 1947 United Nations decision to partition their land and grant 56%
of it to Jewish immigrants mainly from Europe. Driven by an apparent sense of guilt for
their own persecution of European Jews, the victorious allies led by the United States
sought atonement by supporting large-scale Jewish emigration to Palestine. When confronted
with resistance from the indigenous people, the Zionist settlers in turn unleashed an
unprecedented campaign of terror which triggered an exodus of Palestinians that has
continued until this day.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Though essentially a political problem, the
Palestinian refugee crisis soon developed into a major humanitarian disaster as an
estimated 805,067 inhabitants streamed into camps in the Gaza Strip, Jordan, Lebanon and
Syria. During the six months leading up to Ben Gurion&#146;s declaration of Statehood on
14 May 1948, United States policy makers began to toy with the idea of replacing the
Partition Plan with a UN trusteeship. Until 1947 the State Department had traditionally
acknowledged Palestinian rights including that of self-determination. After the failure of
the Partition Plan, however, the Americans were forced to devise a new strategy toward
Palestine. To begin with, they encouraged the Jordanian take-over of all areas not
occupied by the Jewish State and its absorption of the refugees. From the summer of 1948
all references to Palestinian rights, especially that of Statehood, disappeared from both
internal and external records of the State Department. Throughout the subsequent decades
the only Palestinian claims recognized by the U.S. were those of the refugees.</font></p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The first initiatives</b></u><br>
Having recognized the Jewish State in Occupied Palestine, the United Nations itself
adopted resolution 194 on 11 December 1948. It specifically stated that those
&#147;refugees wishing to return to their home and live in peace with their neighbours
should be permitted to do so at the earliest practicable date.&#133;&#148; The resolution
also called for the creation of a UN council to prepare the way for the return of the
refugees. The council began its work in March 1949 with visits first to Beirut and then
Tel Aviv. While the Arab States insisted on immediate repatriation before any negotiations
could begin, the Israelis demanded a comprehensive settlement before considering the
return of the refugees.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Truman administration was particularly perturbed
by the Israeli intransigence. The Americans had themselves played a key role in drafting
the final version of resolution 194 which they believed should form the legal basis of all
policies toward the refugee problem. It was in this context, therefore, that President
Truman on 6 September 1948 gave his unconditional support to the proposals of the UN
mediator, Count Folke Bernadotte, &#147;that the local government in Israel should take
measures to relieve the suffering of the refugees&#148; by expediting their return at the
fastest possible opportunity.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Bernadotte was, observably, no stranger to
humanitarian crises. He had gained international acclaim in 1945 for his work on behalf of
the International Red Cross to save thousands of Jews from Nazi concentration camps. One
day before he was assassinated (16 September 1948) by a Zionist terrorist in Jerusalem,
Bernadotte wrote that there was absolutely no chance of reaching a just and comprehensive
settlement to the Palestinian Question unless their right to return was recognized. The
story of his killing has since remained a standing testimony of the betrayal and injustice
that has always been a hallmark of Zionism. For although the head of the Stern Gang,
Nathan Friedman-Yellin, was sentenced to five years&#146; imprisonment for the murder, he
was quickly pardoned and elected to the Knesset in 1950.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Count Bernadotte&#146;s plea for the restoration of
Palestinian rights did not go unheeded. While addressing the UN General Assembly a few
days after the assassination, U.S. Secretary of State, George Marshall, urged the world
body to adopt the mediator&#146;s proposal, which he believed constituted the &#147;best
possible basis for realizing peace.&#148; Several months later President Truman went
further and issued an ultimatum to the Israelis. In a letter dated 29 May 1949, he told
Ben Gurion that the U.S. was utterly dismayed with the Israeli violation of international
law and warned that his administration may be forced to review its relationship with the
Jewish State. When the Tel Aviv administration stood its ground, it was the Americans who
had to humbly back down.</font></p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Eisenhower years </b></u><br>
With the arrival of Dwight D. Eisenhower to the White House in January 1953, American
interest in the refugee problem entered a new phase. A dual approach was adopted and
remained in force until 1967. It entailed, in the first instance, the provision of relief
supplies and assistance to the refugees and secondly, a search for a practical political
solution.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Shortly after taking office, Secretary of State John
Foster Dulles visited the region and recommended that some of the refugees should be
allowed to return. At the time it appeared that Congress was inclined to an economic
rather than a political solution. It involved the exploitation of the waters of the Jordan
River. Eisenhower was himself convinced that &#147;the acceptance of a comprehensive plan
to develop the Jordan Valley would help immensely in ensuring stability in the Near
East.&#148; It was envisioned that an estimated 300,000 refugees stood to benefit from the
Jordan Valley Development Programme. Arab rejection of the plan and Israel&#146;s
insistence on continuing with its own water-carrier project aborted the American plan. In
September 1953 Eisenhower ordered the cancellation of all aid to Israel pending its
cessation of attempts to divert the Jordan River. The American message was clear as well
as effective and it took the Israelis a mere two months to climb down from their pedestal
of belligerence.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">While the 1953 suspension of aid was enough to force
an Israeli retreat from the waters of the Jordan River, it was, ostensibly, not enough to
force the repatriation of the refugees. The Eisenhower administration therefore drifted
toward the provision of material assistance while the search for a political solution
continued. While unveiling the joint U.S.-British &#147;Operation Alpha&#148; on 26 August
1955, Secretary of State Dulles called for Israeli compensation to the tune of $280
million to be paid to the refugees. Both the U.S. and Britain had agreed that Israel
should raise 30% of the funds while the former two would provide the rest through
long-term, low-interest loans. The onset of the Suez crisis the following year aborted the
plan and effectively brought to an end all efforts by President Eisenhower to solve the
refugee crisis.</font></p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Enter AIPAC </b></u><br>
Whereas the appearance of the American Israeli Public Affairs Committee (AIPAC) on Capitol
Hill in 1959 signaled the emergence of a new era of U.S. policy toward the region, it did
not spell anything good for the refugees. Being the most powerful special interest group
in the U.S., AIPAC succeeded in those early days to convince Washington that Israel was
worthy of being a strategic ally in the Middle East. In the aftermath of the Suez crisis,
the U.S. welcomed the notion of a regional ally to counter the growth of the Arab
nationalist movement and the spread of Soviet influence in an area perceived as the soft
under-belly of NATO.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Following the visit of Senator Hubert Humphrey to
the camps in 1956, the question of the refugees continued to haunt policy makers. Humphrey
warned that further failures to resolve the crisis would lead to a spread of communist
ideas among the refugees. Accordingly, the Kennedy administration adopted a plan developed
by Joseph E. Johnson, a former president of the Carnegie Endowment for International
Peace. Based essentially on UN resolution 194, the Johnson plan sought to apply the
formula of repatriation or resettlement and compensation. The mere thought of considering
repatriation was anathema to Prime Minister Ben Gurion. Thus in order to induce them the
Kennedy administration offered the sale of major weapons to the Israelis with the hope
that they would accept the Johnson plan. Although the Tel Aviv authorities accepted the
American weapons, they categorically refused to reciprocate on the question of the
refugees. Thus ended the last major U.S. initiative toward the refugees.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The fact that 82% of the Jewish electorate had voted
for Kennedy in 1960 was no doubt a telling factor that prompted him to lift the 1947 U.S.
embargo on the sale of weapons to the Zionists. Both his immediate successors, Lyndon
Johnson and Richard Nixon, were considered even more supportive of Israel on major issues
such as arms, territory and the refugees. The former&#146;s belief that Israel was the
&#147;underdog&#148; made it possible not only for the capture of East Jerusalem in 1967,
but also the expulsion of another 500,000 Palestinians from their homes.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Meanwhile, the gains and position of the Israeli
lobby machine&#150;AIPAC&#150;was considerably strengthened after the arrival of Henry
Kissinger at the helm of the State Department during the Nixon and Ford presidencies
respectively. Himself a Jewish immigrant from Austria, Kissinger played a major role in
convincing the U.S. political establishment that the Arab-Israeli conflict was a
by-product of the Cold War. Yitzhak Rabin paid tribute in his memoirs to Kissinger
recalling, &#147;The story of Kissinger&#146;s contribution to Israel&#146;s security has
yet to be told, and for the present suffice it to say that it was of prime
importance.&#148;</font></p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Abandonment under Clinton </b></u><br>
The acceleration of Zionist influence in the State Department after Kissinger coincided
with a corresponding rapid decline in the fortunes of the refugees. Under the Clinton
administration their plight degenerated significantly from bad to worse. Since his first
inauguration in January 1993, President Clinton&#146;s refugee policy had shifted from one
of compromise to total abandonment. The current strategy pursued by Washington has been to
dissolve the international nature of the refugee problem and confine it to bilateral
negotiations between Israel and the Palestinian Authority. Toward this end, the U.S. has
made several attempts to dismantle the United Nations Relief and Welfare Agency (UNRWA),
the organization that has, since 1949, looked after the affairs of the refugees.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Similarly on 8 December 1993 the Clinton
administration took the unprecedented step of refusing to support the reaffirmation of UN
resolution 194 in the General Assembly. This, quite astoundingly, was the first time in
almost 50 years that the U.S. had failed to support the very resolution that it had
drafted. According to White House officials, the September 1993 Israeli-PLO accords have
made all previous resolutions &#147;obsolete and anachronistic.&#148; Secretary of State
Madeleine Albright summed up her government&#146;s position on the refugees in a letter to
members of the General Assembly dated 8 August 1994, &#147;We believe that resolution
language referring to the &#145;final status&#146; issues should be dropped...These
include refugees.&#148; Thus in total violation of international law, the U.S. House of
Representatives in June 1997 took the unprecedented step of recognizing Jerusalem as the
&#147;undivided and eternal capital&#148; of Israel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Having supported the Partition Plan, the U.S. had,
in the immediate years thereafter, recognized its shared responsibility for the
Palestinian refugee problem. After making several tentative political efforts to find a
solution within the framework of UN resolution 194, the Americans gradually succumbed to
Zionist pressure and abandoned the refugees. Aided by a favourable uni-polar international
system, they have further seized the opportunity to impose an Israeli status quo over
Jerusalem contravening the Fourth Hague Convention (1907), the Fourth Geneva Convention
(1949) and UN Security Council resolutions 242 (1967) and 478 ( 1980).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">For the handful of politicians and technocrats who
wheel and deal in secret, international resolutions concerning the refugees and other
final status issues may seem &#147;obsolete&#148;. Yet to the millions of Palestinians who
continue to bear the burdens and share the memories of exile, their right to repatriation
remains as &#147;inalienable&#148; as the right of every American to life, liberty and
justice. Being signatories to all the international conventions on humanitarian law, the
democratic nations of Europe must accordingly take immediate steps, with or without
American support, to honour their treaty obligations and duties toward the Palestinian
refugees. </font></p>

The Palestinian Question</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Occupied Jerusalem- Interview by Khalid Amayreh</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) castigated
the Israeli-PA summit talks at Camp David, arguing the talks were aimed at liquidating the
Palestinian cause. The Movement&#146;s founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin
called the summit &#147;an exposed attempt to liquidate the Palestinian Question.&#148; He
called on Palestinian Authority Chairman Yasser Arafat to leave Camp David and return to
Palestine. On 18 July, the Palestine Times interviewed Sheikh Yassin. The following are
excerpts of what transpired.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Question:</b> What are your expectations of the
summit at Camp David?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Answer:</b> I believe it is likely to end in failure
because the Israelis and the Americans are seeking to impose surrender on the Palestinian
leadership. Moreover, the Palestinian cause has deep historical and religious roots, and a
few days of superficial discussions will not lead to a historical solution to the question
of Palestine.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q: </b>Why do oppose the summit?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> The summit is aimed first and foremost at
pressuring and bullying the Palestinian leadership into surrendering to the Zionists and
accepting a deformed settlement whereby Israel would retain its occupation of the bulk of
Palestine, including Jerusalem, and would deny the Palestinian refugees the right of
return. I hope the Palestinian leadership will be strong enough and brave enough and
patriotic enough to withstand American pressure.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q: </b>What if it doesn&#146;t?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> Any agreement signed at Camp David that
doesn&#146;t meet the legitimate rights of the Palestinian people will be null and void,
and the masses and the present and future generations will not be bound by it, neither in
the present nor in the future. Even if a small group of Palestinians caved in, the vast
majority of the people and the future generations will not accept it.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> So you don&#146;t think that an agreement
would end the Palestinian problem?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> Absolutely. The Palestinian Question is a
question of a lost homeland that needs to be liberated and usurped rights that need to be
redeemed. A concocted deal here and there will prove futile, sooner or later.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> Do you feel that your opposition to the Oslo
Accords has been vindicated in light of the Israeli rejection to give up Jerusalem and
come to terms with the Palestinian right of return?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> Well, our opposition to Oslo was vindicated
from its very inception. Now, every ordinary Palestinian citizen realizes that Oslo was a
gigantic disaster. The Oslo agreement is what we are witnessing today.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q: </b>Don&#146;t you think Arafat will not buckle
under American pressure?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> We hope he will say no. However, it is clear
that the Americans want to isolate him there and impose on him a capitulatory settlement
whereby the Palestinians would give up the vast bulk of Palestinian and Muslim rights in
Palestine, including Jerusalem and the right of return.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> Some say that Arafat has no choice but to
take all that he can take in light of the balance of power?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> No, this is wrong. If the current Palestinian
leadership is powerless to liberate the land and restore the usurped rights, at least it
shouldn&#146;t concede. In any case, the task of liberating the land can be left for
future generations if the present generations are powerless. Moreover, nobody is
authorized to concede on the rights of the people. Nobody has the right to give up even an
atom of Palestine. Palestine doesn&#146;t belong to the Palestinians alone; it belongs to
all Arabs and Muslims from Indonesia to Morocco. </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q: </b>You called on Arafat to return to Palestine
immediately?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> Yes, because I am convinced, just as most
Palestinians are convinced, that the Palestinians will lose from this summit however its
outcome may be. Moreover, it is scandalous that we trust the United States as an honest
broker. We all know the role the U.S. has been playing in tormenting out people and
enabling the Zionists to persecute us and usurp our rights.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> What if Arafat returned to Gaza with an
agreement that gave Jerusalem to Israel and scrapped the refugees&#146; right of return?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> This would amount to a political suicide on
his part. Who can concede on Jerusalem and concede on the right of refugees? </font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> This week, Hamas supporters joined Fatah
supporters in urging Arafat to cling to the national constants. Does Hamas support these
constants?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> We, too, urge the Palestinian leadership to
stick to the &#147;red lines&#148; it said it won&#146;t cross. However, we in Hamas
consider Palestine from the river to the sea as an Islamic land, and we can never lend
recognition to the Zionist regime because it was built on oppression and usurpation of our
homeland.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> It seems that virtually all the Palestinians
will not accept any settlement that does not include the restoration of East Jerusalem?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> Al-Quds al-Sharif (Holy Jerusalem) is the
first Qibla (the direction to which Muslims turn their faces during prayer) of Muslims and
the third holiest Islamic shrine in the world. Giving up Jerusalem would be an act of
grand perfidy and unforgivable treason. Jerusalem belongs to the Muslim Umma, even to the
yet-to-be-born Muslims. Nobody has any right to tamper with Jerusalem, and any agreement
or pact or deal that does not include the full liberation of Al-Quds will be null and
void.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q: </b>And the right of refugees? Do you think it
can be implemented?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> All heavenly and man-made laws and norms
grant refugees the right to return to their homes. Nobody can deny me the right to return
to my town and village from which I was wrongly expelled. The right of return is a sacred
right and nobody has the right to give it away.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q:</b> Do you feel that Israel&#146;s refusal to
carry out UN resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian cause justify Hamas&#146;
uncompromising stance?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> This question should be addressed to the
people of Oslo (the PLO) who made many Palestinians believe that the Oslo process would
culminate in the implementation of UN resolutions. In fact, what you said shows that
Israel understands only the language of force.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Q</b>:<b> </b>So what is the alternative?</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A:</b> The alternative is to revive Jihad and
resistance against the Zionist occupation. Only through Jihad and the mobilization of the
Muslim Umma can we recover and extract our rights and lands from Israel&#146;s hands.</font>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Camp David revisited</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Francis A. Boyle*</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">When the Israeli government originally presented the
Oslo document to the Palestinian delegation to the Middle East Peace Negotiations in the
fall of 1992, it was rejected because it obviously constituted a bantustan. This document
carried out Menachem Begin&#146;s disingenuous interpretation of the Camp David
Accords&#150;expressly rejected by U.S. President Jimmy Carter&#150;calling for autonomy
for the people but not for the land as well. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Soon thereafter, unbeknownst to the delegation and
to almost everyone else, the Israeli government opened up a secret channel of negotiations
in Norway. There the Israeli government re-presented the document that had already been
rejected by the Palestinian delegation in Washington, D.C. It was this document&#150;with
insubstantial modifications&#150;that was later signed at the White House on 13 September
1993. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Even if Oslo had succeeded, it would have resulted
in the imposition of a bantustan upon the Palestinian People. But Oslo has run its course!
Therefore, it is my purpose here today to sketch out a NEW DIRECTION for the Palestinian
People to consider as an alternative to the Oslo process. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">First, we must immediately move for the de facto
suspension of Israel throughout the entirety of the United Nations System, including the
General Assembly and all UN subsidiary organs and bodies. We must do to Israel what the UN
General Assembly has done to the genocidal rump Yugoslavia and to the criminal apartheid
regime in South Africa! Here the legal basis for the de facto suspension of Israel at the
UN is quite simple: as a condition for its admission to the United Nations Organization,
Israel formally agreed to accept General Assembly resolution 181 (II, 1947 [on partition
and Jerusalem trusteeship]) and General Assembly resolution 194 (III, 1948 [Palestinian
right of return]), inter alia. Nevertheless, the government of Israel has expressly
repudiated both resolution 181 (II) and resolution 194 (III). Therefore, Israel has
violated its conditions for admission to UN membership and thus must be suspended on a de
facto basis from any participation throughout the entire United Nations System. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Second, any further negotiations with Israel must be
conducted on the basis of resolution 181 (II) and its borders; resolution 194 (III);
subsequent General Assembly resolutions and Security Council resolutions; the Third and
Fourth Geneva Conventions of 1949; the 1907 Hague Regulations; and other relevant
principles of public international law. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Third, we must abandon the fiction and the fraud
that the United States government is an &#147;honest broker.&#148; The United States
government has never been an honest broker from well before the very outset of these
negotiations in 1991. Rather, the United States has invariably sided with Israel against
the Palestinians. We need to establish some type of international framework to sponsor
these negotiations where the Palestinian negotiators will not be subjected to the
continuous bullying, threats, harassment and intimidation perpetrated by the United States
working in conjunction with Israel. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Fourth, we must move to make the UN General Assembly
adopt comprehensive economic, diplomatic and travel sanctions against Israel pursuant to
the terms of the Uniting for Peace resolution (1950). The General Assembly&#146;s
Emergency Special Session on Palestine is now in recess just waiting to be recalled. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">These four steps, taken in conjunction with each
other, should be enough to enable the Palestinian People to obtain restitution,
reparations and repatriation to their homes and land. By contrast, if the Oslo process is
continued at Camp David, it will inevitably result in the imposition of a bantustan upon
the Palestinian People living in occupied Palestine, as well as the final displacement,
dispossession and disenfranchisement of all Palestinian People living in Diaspora around
the world. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Edward Said</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Shortly after South Lebanon was liberated and
Israeli troops evacuated the area they had occupied for 22 years, I had a discussion of
the event with a good friend who works for the Palestinian Authority. When I said that as
Palestinians we had a lot to learn from the Lebanese resistance, I was met with a flood of
disclaimers and denials. Palestine and Lebanon are totally different, I was told, and to
make comparisons is a serious error. I said that I certainly agreed that the two
situations were different and that ours was indeed a more difficult one. However, I
nevertheless continued by arguing that Hizbullah&#146;s discipline, its willingness to
make sacrifices and its extraordinary, relentless dedication to its objectives were things
that applied to all situations, not just to South Lebanon. The response was even more
adamant. I was told that we had no alternative but to do what we did at Oslo, and when I
said that I could partially understand that but that I didn&#146;t feel that despotism and
corruption&#150;the Authority&#146;s unfortunate hallmarks&#150;were the only alternatives
after signing so disadvantageous an agreement with Israel, I was instructed definitively
that I was taking a narrow view and that we are passing through a transitional period and
these setbacks are part of that. When I remained unconvinced by all of this, I was
reminded by my friend that I had no experience in real politics, which were not the
province of academics and intellectuals. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Precisely this argument was echoed on 18 June in a
column by Jim Hoagland of the Washington Post who when asking Abu Alaa about my criticism
of the Authority&#146;s behaviour could only get the following reply (rather a weak one, I
must say): &#147;It is not intellectuals who are going to make the deals needed for
peace.&#148; This is like saying that only a chicken can tell a good egg from a rotten
one. Besides, Abu Alaa&#146;s expertise in peace-making derives neither from education nor
prior work (he used to direct the PLO&#146;s factories in Beirut, all of which failed or
went bankrupt). One supposes therefore that he was born to make peace deals, just as Louis
XIV was born to rule France. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">I would call this the first kind of magic thinking,
a style of reasoning that blurs the distinction between truth and fiction so as to make a
man-made, deliberately constructed disaster seem like a necessary or at least an
acceptable thing. Members of the Authority follow their leader in assigning credit for
Israel&#146;s shabby withdrawal from South Lebanon to Mr. Barak&#146;s desire for peace,
not to military defeat. By the same token, they conclude that corruption and
anti-democratic rule are necessary stages of history rather than actual choices made by
them to be anti-democratic and corrupt. I suppose the main question is: Who do they think
they are fooling by this logic? No sane person would fail to mark its dreadful lapses or
its patent weaknesses. So then we must conclude that they are its victims, very few
others. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A second type of magical thought is common to those
whose position of great power allows them to be insulated from the facts, to impose on
those facts a reading that is at total odds with what anyone else using common sense would
see there. For the past seven years I have heard every American policy maker from
President Bill Clinton on down sing the praises of the peace process, extol the new world
that was coming into being, waxing ecstatic about the promise of peace and the age of
prosperity that was dawning. Palestinians made brave noises about being like Singapore, an
island of prosperity in a sea of poverty. Israelis built their rhetoric on equally sandy
foundations. They looked forward to being welcomed all over the Arab world, marketing
their goods from the Gulf to Morocco, doing business with everyone, and so on. Perhaps I
should also add that all these effusions came from rulers, presidents, government
functionaries and some journalists, in other words, all those people whose position of
power allowed them VIP status, men and women who didn&#146;t have to queue up at four in
the morning at Gaza&#146;s Eretz border, or those whose passports and identity cards in
Lebanon, for example, designated them as aliens without rights, or those whose houses had
just been demolished. Free of that kind of annoyance, then, these people of privilege
could indulge in magical thought and wishful thinking to their heart&#146;s content. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">This isn&#146;t just a matter of saying things that
have no real connection to ordinary reality, but also imposing a logic on the past that
simply spirits it away altogether. I first heard this kind of magical thought when young
King Abdullah of Jordan made his first visit to the United States last year. While
acknowledging all of Jordan&#146;s political and economic difficulties, the king then
shifted gears immediately after saluting Ehud Barak&#146;s recent election victory in
Israel. Once the peace process is back on track, he said, we can gain the kind of
stability that will bring us prosperity and make Jordan a very attractive place for major
foreign investment. This is an argument that American policy makers like to use: once we
have &#147;peace&#148;, everyone will be happy and we go on to prosper, invest freely and
make money, live happily ever after. I call this magic because it denies the weight of the
past any role at all in the future, as if all the years of dislocation, suffering,
dispossession and distortion imposed on those millions of Arab citizens who lost their
families, homes, means of livelihood, who lived under military occupation, who were forced
to endure states of emergency in Arab countries with scarcely any democracy or social and
economic equality&#150;as if all this with its burden of anger, sorrow, frustration,
humiliation and sheer human fatigue&#150;would suddenly disappear the moment a peace
agreement is signed on Mr. Clinton&#146;s lawn. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">It is the essence of magical thinking, therefore, to
make light of what is in fact heavy, that keeps a formidable pressure on everyone in the
Middle East. This is not a matter of vindictive memory, but of living actuality. Israeli
and American Middle East experts repeat like a mantra that young people have forgotten
1948 and are more interested in the local Internet café than they are in recovering or
returning to their villages. How can that be so? Palestinian refugees in Lebanon and Syria
and elsewhere remain Stateless aliens and, whether or not they cherish visits to the
Internet café, they are compelled by their intolerably precarious status to recall 1948
and their inalienable right of return. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">As for Palestinians who live in Palestine itself, of
course they want to lead normal lives, send their children to school, get good medical
treatment, travel and enjoy all the benefits of security. The fact that none of these
things is really possible therefore compels them to ask why their situation is unlike that
of Israelis, whom they see daily enjoying their much greater freedom and prosperity.
Palestinians would have to be stones not to feel resentment and anger at why they must
give up ancestral land to Russian Jews like Anatol Scharansky, who not only was born and
brought up in Russia but is now challenging Barak not to give up Abu Dis, an Arab town
which as a Russian Jew he feels he can dispose of at will. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">These grotesque, not to say bizarre inequities and
distortions suggest something far graver, more mutilating and wounding to the spirit than
can be rectified by an imperfect peace treaty between a nuclear power like Israel and a
poorly led, destitute people like the Palestinians. Only a miracle of thought&#150;a sort
of magic trick&#150;can quickly set things straight, bring back tranquility and peace of
mind and restore Arabs to a state of redemptive hope. </font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Unfortunately, the real world affords no such magic
and only an occasional miracle. In the meantime, those who suffer must continue to do
so&#150;the mothers whose sons and daughters are in prison, the fathers who cannot cross
into Israel for work, the teachers who remain on strike and thousands more like
them&#150;while those who fantasize about the quick benefits of peace plan more seminars,
give more speeches and embark on new projects. But is there any hope at all that magic and
reality can ever be reconciled? Alas, no.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">(2-2)</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">We need not engage in a debate on history or a round
of objections and counter objections. But some quick notes are in order on what the
&#147;Arab embellishment mentality&#148; presented as givens. First the Arab armies had
never fought a real war with Israel. In 1948, most of the Arab countries were occupied,
under mandate, or protectorates of Western colonial powers that supported the Zionist
position. Arab participation in that decisive battle was under whelming.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The amount of Arab participation in that decisive
battle was less than required. The seven Arab armies that participated had 25,000
soldiers. The Zionist forces had 65,000 soldiers, with some estimates higher and some
lower. The Egyptian forces fought with malfunctioning weapons and there was no trust
between Arab political and military leaders.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In the 1967 war, Egypt was surprised as were the
other Arab countries that border Israel and all found themselves forced to enter the
battle without any preparation. The result was that Israel occupied six times its area in
six days. Despite the relative victories achieved by the Syrian and Egyptian armies in
1973, the strategic goal of the war for those two countries was not the liberation of
Palestine. In the end, both armies were almost defeated. One entire Egyptian battalion was
surrounded and would have been wiped out if it were not for international intervention to
end the war.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The crisis of Arab governance after Iraq&#146;s
occupation of Kuwait and the ensuing intra-Arab disputes and military triumph over Iraq-
which changed the strategic balance- cannot be separated from the governance of the Arab
regimes. And who is responsible for the intra-Arab conflicts? Is it not the Arab regimes
themselves? How was Iraq destroyed? Was it not due to the intensity of intra-Arab disputes
and the use of Arab air space to reach Iraq?</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The same thing goes for the Soviet collapse. Arab
rhetoric, ever searching for excuses<sub>1 </sub>presented the Soviet Union as the loyal
supporter of legitimate Arab rights. The Soviet collapse created a dangerous strategic
imbalance in the world by taking us from a bipolar to a uni-polar world. The Soviet
presence had created a type of international balance and gave Third World countries more
options in decision making, because two powers with radically different ideologies and
policies but military equality were competing in their courtship of the Arab countries.
The Arab countries had assumed that the Soviet attitude toward Israel would be less biased
in favor of Israel than the American attitude.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Arab governments did not inform their people
that the Soviet Union was the second country to recognize Israel, only hours after Israel
declared its independence. It also did not tell us of the flight of millions of Jews from
Soviet territory to Israel.</font></p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#000000">Occupied Palestine or Independent Israel?</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A deep look into Arab and Palestinian political
behavior indicates that the Arab objective has slowly moved from &#147;occupied
Palestine&#148; to &#147;independent Israel.&#148; Since the Madrid conference of October
30, 1991, when Israel entered into negotiations with the Arab countries, it had achieved
official Arab and Palestinian recognition not only of its existence but of its right to
exist.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">This analysis is confirmed by the Gaza-Jericho First
agreement. In the letters of mutual recognition between the PLO and Israel signed on
September 9, 1999, PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat, in his letter to Israeli Prime Minister
Yitzhak Rabin, wrote:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The [PLO] recognizes Israel&#146;s right to exist
    and renounces all forms of violence and terrorism.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In response<sub> </sub>Rabin sent a letter to Arafat
reading:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Based on your prior commitment, Israel recognizes
    the Palestine Liberation Organization as the sole, legitimate representative of the
    Palestinian people.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Here are clear proofs indicating that Arab
objectives have changed and that the goal is no longer an independent and sovereign
Palestine, but an independent Israel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The first letter deals with the nature of the mutual
recognition. The text refers to &#147;Israel&#146;s right to exist,&#148; and there is a
difference between recognizing existence and recognizing the right to existence,
especially in the Palestinian context. Recognition of the right to exist carries religious
and historic connotations. In Zionist thought, the foundation and justification for the
state of Israel is religious- the Promised Land- and historically- Land of the
Forefathers. Also it is the land where the Temple was built (religious and historic).</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">There are four levels of recognition in
international law:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">1) Recognition of a country&#146;s right to exist is
    the strongest. This level of recognition differs from the others because it cannot be
    withdrawn, canceled, or changed. Such recognition is rarely achieved because it is
    dangerous and sensitive and carries with it many obligations from the state that grants
    it.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">2) Recognition of The status quo is the type of
    recognition that is most popular among independent and sovereign states, and is the one
    most exchanged. It can be withdrawn, changed, and canceled. There can be war between two
    countries while this type of recognition still applies.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">3) Tacit recognition does not allow for an exchange
    of embassies, diplomatic missions, ambassadors, or charges d&#146;affairs. Two countries
    deal with each other at the consulate or representative office level, or less. Commercial
    trade is allowed and visas are granted for entry.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">4) Recognition of a revolution or armed coup is the
    weakest type of recognition in law and diplomacy. It can be changed, canceled, and
    forgotten. It carries no weight in international bodies.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The PLO&#146;s recognition of Israel was at the
highest level. It dealt with the recognition of Israel as a natural and legal right<sub>1 </sub>saying
in essence that Israel&#146;s existence is the way things should be. This recognition
brought about a rise in religious Jewish rhetoric, because Israel was vindicated.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">On the other hand, the Zionist recognition of the
PLO was at the lowest level allowable by international law (recognition of a revolution or
armed coup). Also, there was a condition placed upon that recognition: that the PLO remain
committed to the vows it made (recognition of Israel and renunciation of &#147;violence
and terrorism&#148;). There were other conditions for Zionist recognition of the PLO. Most
important were the requirement to nullify articles from the Palestinian National Charter
calling for the destruction of Israel, adopting armed struggle as a strategic option, and
describing Palestine as the land occupied in 1948 and 1967. Israel did not recognize the
PLO as the sole, legitimate representative of the Palestinian people, nor as the PLO of
the National Charter: Rather it recognized a PLO that had turned into the Palestine Oslo
Organization.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In addition, the Palestinian letter of recognition
included a phrase whereby the PLO promises to renounce all forms of violence and
terrorism. If Israel&#146;s presence on Palestinian soil (at least that occupied in 1948,
according to the official Palestinian vision) was a natural right- with all the historic
and religious dimensions that this implies- then it is natural to apologize for all the
&#147;violence&#148; committed against Israel &#147;unjustly.&#148; This means that the
violence must not be included in the framework of &#147;legitimate struggle,&#148; but
must be considered &#147;terrorism&#148; against the rightful, oppressed Israel. This is
the incentive for the Palestinian Authority&#146;s relentless pursuit, oppression, and
vilification of the Palestinian resistance.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In the spiral of Palestinian concessions of
identity; culture, and civilization, the Wye River Memorandum signed between the two sides
on October 23, 1998, in Washington, reinforced the &#147;Jewish right&#148; to Palestine
at the expense of historic Palestinian rights. Israel placed a condition on the
Palestinian side in the agreement saying:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation
    Organization will confirm the letter sent by PLO Chairman Yasser Arafat on January 22,
    1998, to President Clinton regarding the nullification of articles from the Palestinian
    National Charter that contradict the mutual letters of recognition between the PLO and
    Israeli government signed on September 9 and 10, 1993. The PLO chairman, Palestinian
    National Council chairman, and Central Council chairman will invite members of the PNC and
    PCC and officials of the Palestinian government to a meeting to be addressed by President
    Clinton to affirm his support for the peace process.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Palestinian side committed itself in that
agreement to issue a decree &#147;banning all forms of incitement to violence and
terrorism and forming mechanisms to move systematically against all statements or threats
of violence. &#147;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">This is similar to an Israeli decree that handles
the same issue, saying: &#147;The American- Israeli- Palestinian Committee will meet
regularly to follow-up on cases of possible incitement to violence or terrorism and to
make recommendations on how to prevent this incitement. The Israeli, American, and
Palestinian sides will name experts in the media, law, and education, and an official, a
formal official, or an elected official.&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The members of the Council that Yasser Arafat
invited to meet on December 14, 1998, affirmed the nullification of 10 articles of the
Palestinian National Charter. U.S. President Bill Clinton was present. The articles dealt
with the destruction of Israel, rejection of the U.N. Partition Plan of 1947 and armed
struggle as the strategic path of liberating Palestine. Article 19 was also cut out. It
rejected the Balfour Declaration of 1917. Article 19 said: &#147;The claim of historic and
spiritual connection between the Jews and Palestine is not in agreement with historic fact
or the justifications for a state. Judaism is a heavenly religion and not an independent
nationality. The Jews are not one nation with an independent identity; but citizens of the
countries they belong to.&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Article 7 of the Charter was also deleted. It said:
&#147;The Palestinian physical, spiritual, and historic affiliation to Palestine is a
fact. The Palestinian individual is a revolutionary Arab. All means will be employed to
educate the Palestinian spiritually and physically, and prepare him for armed struggle and
for sacrificing his life and property until victory in regaining his homeland. This is a
patriotic duty.&#148;</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The historic Palestinian right to Palestine was
denied in favor of the historic Jewish right to Palestine. This is clear from the above
two articles that were deleted from the Palestinian National Charter.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">A month before the nullification, on November 19,
1998, Palestinian President Arafat issued a presidential decree banning incitement. It had
three articles:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">1)The following activities are illegal in
    Palestinian governorates: incitement to racial discrimination, encouragement of illegal
    violence, insulting religions, use of violence or incitement to use violence that would
    damage relations with brotherly and foreign countries, formation of illegal associations
    that conduct or incite to crime, the spoilage of life, riling the masses to change through
    illegal use of force, incitement to mischief, or incitement to violation of the agreements
    between the PLO and brotherly or foreign governments.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">2) Anyone who violates the above mentioned laws will
    be punished according to the laws mentioned above.</font></p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">3) This decree is to be published in the Palestinian
    Register and goes into effect immediately.</font></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>
<b>

<p ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#000000">Conclusion</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">There are people who describe the Oslo, Wye River,
Taba, and Cairo agreements as a catastrophe. They say that they are a catastrophe for the
Palestinian issue and its future. They believe they are catastrophic for Jerusalem, which
was kept hostage to Zionist charity, as were also the refugees, who were ignored in the
agreements and will be managed through plans to naturalize them in their host countries
and the newly legitimized settlements.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The most unfortunate aspect of these agreements is
that they put an end to the zero-sum game of &#147;occupied Palestine or independent
Israel,&#148; in favor of the latter, an independent Israel.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The PLO effectively traded Palestinian historic and
religious rights in its pursuit of a legacy for Yasser Arafat, the PLO Chairman. One
motivation was its envy of the resistance, because the intifada earned greater admiration
among the Palestinian people, who have consistently shown their support for the resistance
by electing resistance candidates to various elected positions in lieu of PLO candidates.
Perhaps Yasser Arafat and his cronies felt that the only way to stay in power and to
defeat the resistance was to sell out the people and become a collaborator with the
Zionists who promised them power, money, and peace. If these Israeli promises are like the
many other Israeli promises that have been made to get what they want and then forgotten
or simply ignored later, the PLO will come up empty handed in more ways than one and the
Palestinian people will have paid a very high price for Israel&#146;s independence. </font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Muslim Arabs battle bigotry and hatred in drive <br>
to build a mosque in suburban Chicago</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><b>Ray Hanania*</b></p>
<font size="3">

<p>As most Americans were celebrating their country&#146;s independence, some were
reminding us that the Declaration of Independence is merely a collection of empty words
when it comes to Arab American rights.<br>
This is most apparent as Muslim Arabs living just outside of Chicago in a suburb called
Palos Heights that is known for its undaunting battles to preserve the rights of a tree.<br>
But, when a Muslim foundation announced plans to purchase a Christian Church there that
was up for sale, residents and elected leaders in Palos Heights vowed to prevent the sale.<br>
Angry residents stood up at public meetings and denounced the Muslims, who they said were
&#147;invading&#148; their community. Others said that the Muslim Arabs are
&#147;different,&#148; and they especially are concerned because they &#147;pray on
different days.&#148;<br>
But the bigotry that is growing in Palos Heights as this three month battle continues,
revealed it&#146;s true nature when one of the community leaders who is a leading member
of the Catholic Church and organizer of the Day of Prayer which ostensibly is intended to
bring people of all religions together, denounced Islam on a nationally televised program
as a &#147;false religion.&#148;<br>
In response, some of the elected officials who initially lead the fight to prevent the
Muslims from opening a Mosque in this Chicago suburb are now embarrassed by the open
statements of hostility and bigotry. They voted at a meeting to pay the Al-Salam Mosque
Foundation $200,000 to cover their legal fees if they would &#147;retract their purchase
offer&#148; and find a new location for <br>
their Mosque.<br>
Shocked by the opposition and the hatred, the attorneys for the Mosque Foundation said
they are considering the deal, although it reminded many of the efforts by segregationists
and racists in the deep American South during the 1950s and 1960s when Blacks were offered
money to re-locate to other areas.<br>
Although the bigotry is a concern, what makes an American so confident that they can stand
up and publicly attack another people because of their race and their religion without
fear that they will be punished?<br>
Some say it is the environment where special laws allowing &#147;secret evidence&#148; to
be used against Arab Americans encourages this bigotry. Others say it is the bigotry
inherent in Hollywood movies which churns out hit movie after hit movie where the Arabs
are only portrayed as terrorists and blood thirsty killers. Still others point the same
fingers at the bias in the American <br>
media and in the New York book publishing establishments which both struggle hard to
silence Arab American voices.<br>
And we Christian and Muslim Arabs must also shoulder some of the blame. We live in a
country dominated by media and public relations perceptions, and yet we don&#146;t know
even the basics of communications, which is a sophisticated profession and business.<br>
Palos Heights has a small population of 12,000 people. It is affluent, and a typical
American suburb. There are about 600 Muslim Arab families living in Palos Heights, part of
a stream of Arab movement that stretches 25 miles from 63<sup>rd</sup> Street in Chicago
Southwest to a suburb called Orland Park. These 600 Arab families account for about 20
percent of the village&#146;s population.<br>
While most of these Arab residents are Muslim, the closest Mosque is some three miles
north in a suburb called Bridgeview. In contrast, Palos Heights has 20 Christian Churches,
including the Christian Reformed Church which is the building the Muslims hope to purchase
for $2.1 million.<br>
There are a few more things you should know about this controversy. First, the Christian
Reformed Church has been trying to sell the building for more than 5 years, and no one has
offered to buy it, except the Al-Salam Mosque Foundation.<br>
Foes of the Mosque said they wanted the Muslims to find a new location, preferably outside
of Palos Heights, because they wanted to buy the Church and use it to expand their
existing recreation facilities. However, a plan to expand the village&#146;s recreation
services was rejected, because the residents didn&#146;t want to pay the extra taxes that
would have to be collected.<br>
If the Mosque is forced to find a new location, the village officials say they will buy
the church and convert it to a recreation center, at a cost of $2.1 million. This despite
the fact that the village admits it doesn&#146;t have the $200,000 they want to pay the
Muslims to walk or the $2.1 million to buy the church.<br>
America is a free country. And, as the people of Palos Heights and the surrounding
communities have learned, people here are free to hate whomever they wish.<br>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Arab State System, the Victory in <br>
South Lebanon and the Siege on Iraq</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Ibrahim Alloush*</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In the aftermath of the collapse of the Soviet Union
and war on Iraq, the official Arab State system joined the Madrid Conference and adopted
&#147;peace&#148; with Zionists as a strategic option in word and deed. Ever since the
second Gulf war, the political options of the official Arab State system have been shaped
by the three pillars of the &#147;Damascus Declaration&#148;: Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. These three of the larger Arab States remain today the managers of decision-making
on the official Arab level.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">At any rate, the supervisors of the post-Gulf war
Arab State system rushed to varying degrees on the road to negotiations and normalization
with Zionists in the early 1990s, leading to three &#147;Middle Eastern&#148; Economic
Summits in Cairo, Casablanca and Amman. In this atmosphere of openness, Zionists took full
advantage of the situation to make diplomatic and economic inroads into some of the States
of the Arab Gulf and the Arab Maghreb. Normalization was in full swing. The signing of
Oslo and Wadi Arabah treaties with Zionists was partially the outcome of these strategic
openings. During the same epoch, when Hizbullah tried to organize a demonstration in
Beirut to protest the anniversary of the Oslo agreement, several of its supporters were
either killed or wounded as Lebanese security forces opened fire on Hizbullah
demonstrators. The Lebanese State was then tightly in the hands of Saudi and Syrian policy
makers.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">At the same time friendly overtures towards
&#147;Israel&#148; blossomed into commercial and diplomatic ties, the siege was being
tightened on Iraq. Indeed, the siege on Iraq is maintained at the behest of Tel Aviv and
Washington, but the actual implementation of the siege on Iraq remains totally in the
hands of the official Arab State system and the Islamic States of Iran and Turkey. This
means that if the States of Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia, for example, wanted to break
the siege, that would be totally within their power, as collective punishment against
those States would be virtually impossible. In fact, African States that are much weaker
than the supervisors of the official Arab State system managed to break the air embargo on
Libya when they chose to. But the captains of the Arab State system have resolved that the
siege on Iraq should be maintained for considerations pertaining to regional rivalries,
even if that weakens their hand in negotiations with &#147;Israel&#148;, vis-à-vis
political pressure by the United States government, in Lebanon and elsewhere. Since a weak
Iraq necessarily implies a stronger &#147;Israel&#148;, implementing the siege is an act
of strategic folly. Yet it was similar regional rivalries with Iran on Lebanese soil that
prompted Syrian-backed elements to try to take out Hizbullah in Lebanon in the 1980s to no
avail. Henceforth, it should be added to the credit of Hizbullah&#146;s leadership that
part of its success was owing to its shrewd ability to walk confidently towards liberation
in a landscape filled with political landmines. Obliteration awaits the heedless, and
Hizbullah did forge an indispensable solid alliance with Syria, but its first allegiance
remained invested in the achievement of its strategic goal.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Nevertheless, in the mid-1990s the pillars of the
Arab State system discovered that the so-called peace project with Zionists was but a
preamble for spreading Zionist hegemony over the Arab world, under the banner of the
&#147;New Middle East&#148;. The regimes reigning in larger Arab States figured out that
one of the main features of the New Middle East would be their marginalization and the
appropriation of their regional roles or influence. The New Middle East required a power
vacuum that can only be attained if the larger Arab States are weakened and possibly
fragmented. Thus &#147;Israel&#148; entered the geopolitical space of regional rivalries
through the very openings the Arab State system provided in the early 1990s. There are two
exceptions, however, which distinguish official Arab regional rivalries with
&#147;Israel&#148; from inter-Arab State regional rivalries with each other:</font></p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">1. The code name for the political, economic and
  cultural operation to achieve Zionist hegemony over the Arab World, i.e. the New Middle
  East, entails the further fragmentation of Arab States into smaller units along sectarian,
  religious and ethnic lines. For more on this, see the document translated by Israel Shahak
  on Zionist designs to break up Arab States and foment civil wars, or look at some of the
  papers presented at the Conference on Minorities that was organized by Bar Illan
  University in 1992.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">2. True security for &#147;Israel&#148; in the
  long-run implies that the cultural character and national identity of the Arab world needs
  to be altered from Arab and Islamic into &#147;Middle Eastern&#148;. For as long as the
  Arab world remains Arab and Islamic, &#147;Israel&#148; under any political system does
  not belong, whereas every single Arab regime, whether legitimate or not, does. To stop
  feeling like the strange kid on the bloc, &#147;Israel&#148; has no choice but to
  inoculate the rest of the region with the disease of &#147;Middle Easternism&#148;, i.e.
  to reign supreme on a plethora of weak sectarian, religious and ethnic fiefdoms from
  Morocco to Iraq.</font></p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Either way, with the arrival of Benjamin Netanyahu
to power in &#147;Israel&#148;, and the wholesale adoption of Zionist demands in
negotiations with Arab States by the Clinton administration, the Arab State system
suddenly found itself fighting not for regional influence as before, but for its very
survival. The Egyptian State was one of the first to be alerted to Zionist designs to
fragment the Arab States. The Egyptian press started to treat the issue openly, and the
adoption by the U.S. Congress of a resolution to &#147;defend&#148; the Coptic minority in
Egypt at the behest of Zionist elements there reinforced the idea. In fact, the recent
arrest of Dr. Sa&#146;ad Ed-din Ibrahim, by the Egyptian State, comes in this very
context. Ironically, the latter was actively engaged in promoting minority consciousness
in Egypt and the rest of the Arab World, with certain help from the Centre of Arab Unity
Studies in Beirut at some point.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Consequently, the Arab State system found itself
forced to take some protective measures to defend itself. This resulted in the adoption of
stronger defensive postures in negotiations with the Zionists, halting the process of
normalization with &#147;Israel&#148;, and standing up more forcefully to U.S. government
pressure on bombing Iraq, for example, or to tighten the noose around Hizbullah. In the
meantime, larger Arab States like Egypt, Syria and Saudi Arabia tried to keep the official
Arab house in order by keeping the smaller Arab States within the prescribed limits.
Zionists and the U.S. government, on the other hand, continued to try to make inroads
through the smaller Arab States like Lebanon, Mauritania, Jordan and the Palestinian
Authority, among others. The weight of the Arab State system is the present absent
hard-line negotiator today at Camp David II. Arafat knows the dear price of breaking too
radically with the dictates of Egypt and Saudi Arabia, while the U.S. government and
&#147;Israel&#148; want him to do exactly that.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Mind you, the official Arab State regime here is not
fighting for any principles or lofty goals, and the last thing on its mind is the interest
of the Arab people. It is simply trying to preserve itself. It just happens that conflicts
of political interests with Zionist and U.S. government plans for the Arab world gave
crucial breathing space for anti-Zionist forces in the Arab world on the popular level in
Jordan, Egypt and elsewhere. The magic of Hizbullah is that it was better positioned to
take advantage of this crucial breathing space than others. Of course, the victory of
South Lebanon could not have been without official support from Syria, Egypt and Saudi
Arabia. But let there be no mistake about it: the victory belongs to the Arab people. They
paid for it, and they made it happen with their blood and sacrifices! In South Lebanon,
the interests of the Arab people and the Arab State system happened to coincide, but that
does not mean that they are one and the same.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Surely, though, anti-Zionist forces should have no
qualms whatsoever about taking full advantage of pragmatic conflicts of interest between
the Arab State system and the enemies of our people. When the managers of the Arab State
system, namely Syria, Egypt and Saudi Arabia, oppose a fourth &#147;Middle Eastern&#148;
Economic Summit in Doha, Qatar, and bring it to utter failure, when they put the brakes on
smaller Arab States rushing to normalize with the invader, when they oppose another
military strike on Iraq, and when they oppose the settlement of Palestinian refugees in
Arab States, we should push them further along that road by seizing the moment to escalate
the conflict with the invader as Hizbullah has done.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">However, let us not wallow in illusions about where
these States come from and about the limits of their opposition to post-colonial plans.
For they agree with peace with &#147;Israel&#148; in principle, but they only want better
terms for the deal, and their opposition measures all purport to serve as tactical cards
to improve their hand on the negotiating table and to preserve their ruler-ships. In
short, they want to ameliorate and find a formula to coexist with the Zionist project, not
to overthrow it. But the Zionists would not let them have that, because the Arab State
system itself helped the balance of power reach the unsavory point it is at now. In a way,
that&#146;s very good.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Yes, it was commendable that the Arab State system
should condemn the recent sprint by the Algerian State to normalize relations with the
Zionists! That, however, is but a tactical move. A true strategic move to tilt the balance
of power against &#147;Israel&#148; would be to lift the siege on Iraq now. This would be
a wise move even if one&#146;s intention is to negotiate with &#147;Israel&#148; on better
terms. Unfortunately, the Arab State system does not always act wisely. Thus the Qatari
initiative to lift the siege on Iraq was preempted by the official Arab system, for the
very reason that initiative itself was launched by Qatar in the first place: regional
rivalries, specifically, to loosen the Saudi grip on the States of the Arab Gulf.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Hence, there is no room for keeping faith in Arab
regimes of any kind. Surely, protecting their regimes requires them to do good sometimes,
as in supporting the liberation effort in South Lebanon, but that is not good enough.
Genuine social and political change in the Arab world entails the establishment of
fighting popular grass-roots movements with an independent and unwavering leadership that
is committed to a strategic vision of liberation, Arab unity and social and economic
justice and progress. And that is the primary lesson of the victory in South Lebanon.</font></p>

  <p ALIGN="center">Part 11</p>
  <p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Two Main Haredi Groups</font></p>
  </b><p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">By the beginning of the 1990s, the confrontation
  between the unbending Haredi version of Ashkenazi exclusiveness and Oriental
  traditionalism, which previously was potentially explosive, erupted. The Ashkenazi Haredi
  movement insisted upon completely freezing the situation that existed in central and
  eastern Europe around 1860. The Oriental Jews, trained by Ashkenazi Haredi Jews, were
  forced to discard their traditional garb, wear the black Ashkenazi clothing and learn and
  speak Yiddish. Yiddish was the language of oral instruction in the Haredi yeshivot; Hebrew
  was reserved for writing. The Oriental traditionalists were also forced to adopt the
  Ashkenazi manner of praying, which differed in numerous ways from their former method.
  Revered rabbis, who commanded authority and encountered almost no opposition, imposed
  those radical changes. By contrast, the various attempts by the Labor movement to impose
  modernizing constraints upon the Orientals in the 1 950s sparked furious opposition among
  the Oriental masses, who would often criticize politicians but hardly ever criticize
  rabbis. </font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Oriental students in Ashkenazi Haredi yeshivot,
  after years of docile submission to demands and after being ordained as rabbis, were not
  granted status equal to that of their fellow students and rabbis. They have continued to
  accept and even today seem to be content with their inferior treatment. An excellent
  illustration of this is the inequality in intermarriage with their Ashkenazi peers. All
  Jewish communities share the time-honored custom that the head of the yeshiva arranges all
  marriages of yeshiva students. He carefully picks the daughters of rich and pious Jews as
  wives for students. The better students are matched with the daughters of the wealthiest
  parents. (The head of the yeshiva also matches daughters of rabbis with sons of the
  wealthiest parents.) Yeshiva students have selflessly complied with this matchmaking;
  resisting has been -and still is- considered to be a grave sin. </font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Ashkenazi Haredi Jews have never formally prohibited
  marriages with pious Jews from other communities. Such marriages, nevertheless, often have
  been -and still are- considered disgraces. Because of this, the heads of Ashkenazi Haredi
  yeshivot adopted the custom, still followed, of matching Oriental students, however
  distinguished in their studies, with either physically handicapped Ashkenazi brides or
  ones from poor families.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">Not surprisingly, an unwritten rule developed
  whereby Oriental students, however distinguished, would not be appointed to any
  responsible teaching positions even in lower-rank yeshivot, attended solely by Oriental
  students. These teaching jobs were reserved for Ashkenazi rabbis, the underlying
  assumption being that Oriental Jews were not yet sufficiently mature to hold responsible
  religious positions. When Rabbi Shach, one of the foremost Haredi leaders, explicitly
  reiterated this assumption shortly before the 1992 elections, he was denounced as being
  racist by many Ashkenazi secular Jews; neither Oriental rabbis nor Oriental political
  activists uttered one word of public criticism.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">No Oriental initiative was responsible for the
  creation of the Haredi political party, Shas. Rabbi Shach formed Shas before the 1988
  elections, because he, in his rivalry with other prominent Ashkenazi Haredi rabbis, needed
  to have Knesset members that would be subservient only to him. He, therefore, ordered
  those rabbis that were his students and retained personal allegiance to him to form two
  new, separate, Haredi political parties: Degel Ha&#146;Tora (Banner of the Law) would be
  purely Ashkenazi; Shas (an acronym for Sephardi List for Tradition) would be purely
  Oriental. After the formation of both parties, the party leaders publicly regarded Rabbi
  Shach as their highest spiritual authority and vowed to obey him unconditionally. In order
  to make Shas also attractive to non-Haredi Orientals, Shach handpicked a non-Haredi
  Oriental rabbi upon whom he could rely -Rabbi Ovadia Yoseph, the former chief rabbi of
  Israel- to act as the nominal party head. Shach, of course, retained authority. For Shach,
  Yoseph&#146;s greatest virtue was that, after failing to win re-election as chief rabbi
  due to the NRP&#146;s refusal to exert influence on his behalf, Yoseph hated the NRP as
  fiercely as did Shach himself. As is well known in Israel, hatred between secular Jews
  cannot match in intensity the mutual hatred between diverse groups of religious Jews,
  especially in the quarrels between rabbis representing those diverse groups. Shach had
  good reason to expect that, because of his wish to retaliate against NRP rabbis, Yoseph
  would remain loyal to him and be content with his subordinate role.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">For a while everything worked as Shach had planned.
  The two parties, controlled by Shach, obtained eight Knesset seats altogether in the 1988
  elections; Degal Ha&#146;Tora had two seats; Shas, six seats. The Haredi party, Agudat
  Israel, against which Shach formed his parties, obtained only five seats. Degel
  Ha&#146;Tora and Shas preferred a Likud government and after the 1988 elections supported
  Yitzhak Shamir as the prime minister. Their support may have been decisive. After 1990
  Shamir would not have had a Knesset majority without their support. The self-demeaning
  attempts by the Labor Party leader, Shimon Peres, to reverse this situation failed. Peres
  spent months attending lessons of Talmud, given in his home by Rabbi Yoseph. Peres
  attempted unsuccessfully to be received by Rabbi Shach; Shach received many petty</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">secular politicians but not Peres. Peres made
  repeated, public pronouncements about how deeply he respected Judaism in general and the
  Haredi rabbis in particular. Everything Peres attempted was in vain. Shach and his rival
  Haredi rabbis did not bend in their support for Shamir. Yitzhak Rabin&#146;s victory over
  Peres for the leadership position in the Labor Party primaries preceding the 1992
  elections was largely due to Labor&#146;s rank-and-file disillusionment with Peres&#146;
  attempts to ingratiate himself with Haredi Jews and to win their support. In spite of this
  experience, Peres repeated the same attempts that resulted in the same results in the 1996
  elections.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The Haredi parties wielded political Dower after
  1988, most especially in the 1988-90 period. Peres, still in the government after 1988,
  supported their demands; Shamir, while Prime Minister, was even more resolute with
  support. Haredi political success can best be measured by the amounts of money the two
  Haredi parties were able to obtain from the state through so-called &#147;special
  money&#148; grants, not subject to fiscal controls of the state. These special money
  grants were made through a voluntary association, formed to remain under the real control
  of a Haredi Knesset member or his friends. The ministry of finance made grants from the
  state budget to such associations,<sub> </sub>most often on the basis of flimsy purpose
  statements and with no control exerted over expenditures. The resultant corruption was
  enormous, reaching a scale unprecedented in the entire history of the State of Israel and
  finally causing the withdrawal of such special money grants.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The extensive corruption involved in the obtaining
  of this special money did not necessarily mean that the money itself was used illicitly.
  Shas spent most of this money to establish a network of institutions designed to exert a
  lasting influence and to train cohorts of militants that in the future could enable the
  party to maximize its control over its public. This network consisted of a chain of
  educational institutions designed to revive traditional Jewish education for boys with
  only sacred and not secular subjects taught. (Shas largely ignored the education of
  girls.) Adult males between the ages of 40 and 50 were encouraged to leave their
  professions or give up their businesses in order to enroll in institutions and study
  sacred subjects with guaranteed remuneration. The remuneration, that is, salaries for
  studying, were admittedly low, but numerous individuals considered the life of study
  preferable to their persisting to do menial work or to maintain decaying businesses. The
  recruits did more than study Talmud. They were required to do political work for Shas.
  These recruits soon constituted Shas&#146; political cadre, which has been and remains
  instrumental in turning Haredi neighborhoods into electoral constituencies under almost
  any conceivable circumstances.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The split between Shas and Rabbi Shach came after
  the 1992 elections and was sparked by a triviality. The split in reality was over the
  rival claims by Shach and Yoseph to be regarded as the spiritual head of Shas. Rabin, when
  forming his coalition, approached and accepted the demands of Shas. Before signing an
  agreement, Shas asked Rabbi Shach for approval. Shach refused, because, as discussed in
  another chapter, Shulamit Aloni was to be named Minister of Education. Shach&#146;s
  newspaper,<sub> </sub>Yated Ne&#146;eman, editorialized that this appointment was worse
  than the killing of one million children during the Holocaust. The reasoning employed here
  was that the Nazis killed the children but did not prevent their son&#146;s from going to
  paradise, whereas the appointment of Aloni could corrupt Jewish souls and deprive them of
  paradise. Rabbi Yoseph and the Shas Party, nevertheless, decided to risk the souls of
  Jewish children and joined Rabin&#146;s government. Rabbi Shach and his followers reacted
  negatively in a furious manner that persisted thereafter.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The confrontation between the two Haredi movements
  has been waged in the magical area over the contest of spiritual authority. In keeping
  with commonly held and magical Haredi beliefs, the Shas leaders&#146; sin of resisting
  Rabbi Shach&#146;s will could be punished by a few curses resulting in either the deaths
  or sicknesses of those leaders and/or their family members. The result would allegedly
  restore heavenly equilibrium. In order to further this magical result, Rabbi Shach&#146;s
  supporters resorted to conduct previously employed in similar situations. They published
  fake announcements of deaths, hospitalizations and/or traffic accidents of Shas leaders
  and then either notified the families accordingly by telephone or sent ambulances to their
  homes. As noted above, internecine hatred between religious Jews, and especially between
  Haredi rabbis, is often virulent. The existence of such hatred has continually resulted in
  disunity within ranks that limits Haredi political power. The methods of internecine
  infighting have been so customarily employed within Haredi culture that, unfortunately for
  Rabbi Shach&#146;s followers, the impact is severely limited. In the domain of magic,
  moreover, Shas has on its side the great authority and renowned miracle worker, Rabbi
  Kaduri, who announced that he would shield all Shas leaders by casting cabbalistic spells.
  Rabbi Kaduri also claimed that God revealed to him that harassment by other Haredi Jews
  would qualify Shas leaders for the greatest Jewish virtue, sanctification of the
  Lord&#146;s name through martyrdom.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">In the contest of spiritual authorities, debate
  ensued over whether Rabbi Yoseph&#146;s spirituality was sufficiently great to validate
  his challenge to Shach&#146;s rabbinical authority, especially in light of Yoseph&#146;s
  former allegiance to Shach. Following the debate all the Shas rabbis decided to obey Rabbi
  Yoseph. Shas rabbis and followers then began to extol Rabbi Yoseph as &#147;the greatest
  rabbi of his generation,&#148; greater even than any Ashkenazi rabbi. This honor had
  previously been awarded to Rabbi Shach. Shas had won its independence. The Ashkenazi
  Haredi Jews thus could not defeat but did sever all connections with Shas. No Ashkenazi
  rabbi distanced himself from Shach&#146;s pronouncements; some added even more venom. The
  leader of the largest Hassidic sect, the Gur Hassids, reiterated his previously expressed
  view that Israel lost the Yom Kippur War (of October 1973) because a woman, Golda Meir,
  was prime minister. He implied that Israel would lose its next war because of Shulamit
  Aloni. Ashkenazi rabbis and their followers used weapons more hurtful than their curses
  and pronouncements.They desecrated Shas synagogues, usually just before the beginning of
  the Sabbath, thus making it difficult to clean in time without desecrating the Sabbath.
  Many Shas leaders, who had been educated in Ashkenazi institutions and who continued to
  pray in Ashkenazi synagogues, were harassed or beaten during the reciting of prayers. One
  Shas leader, Rabbi Pinhassi, was spat upon and beaten in an Ashkenazi synagogue in the
  Haredi town of Bnei Brak during a Sabbath prayer session. Some children of Shas leaders
  were terribly abused. The then Minister of the Interior, Yitzhak Der&#146;i, had to remove
  his sons from an Ashkenazi yeshiva after they were publicly humiliated. Der&#146;i was
  repeatedly harassed, often when attempting to pray in synagogues, by Shach&#146;s
  followers and by religious settlers. Shas followers fought back. On several occasions they
  beat up those who had harassed Der&#146;i; they also desecrated Ashkenazi synagogues in
  retaliation. Shas retaliations ultimately served their opponent&#146;s cause by escalating
  the conflict.</font></p>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#000000">The split and conflict within Haredi ranks
  illustrate the religious transformation of Oriental Jews. For over two decades many
  secular Oriental groups were founded; they all failed to obtain the support of the
  populations they claimed to represent and, as a result, collapsed ignominiously. Their
  failure can be attributed to their obstinate refusal to recognize that the Oriental Jewish
  communities define themselves primarily in religious terms. The Haredi Shas Party will in
  the foreseeable future likely remain the sole Oriental political party in Israel. This
  particular case study may help illustrate the nature of religious transformation of a not
  fully modernized population.</font></p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">An Episode in the Park</font></b><font size="3"><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000"><b>E. Yaghi</b></font></p>

<p><font color="#000000">To the tune of a thin man dancing around a monument, the son and
his parents sat in the park.&nbsp; The time was summer. Some blackbirds hopped on the
grass in search of worms surfacing to the top after days of rain. Several people with dogs
larger than themselves followed the leashes that were mastered by their canine friends.
&nbsp; It wasn&#146;t really that the people were out to walk their dogs, but rather that
the dogs were out to walk their people.<br>
<br>
Parks are normally supposed to be a place where children play and adults stroll, taking
time away from their work and busy lives to enjoy themselves.&nbsp; But in many countries,
parks are dangerous to be in at night and sometimes uncomfortable to be in during the day.
&nbsp; And so it was in this New York park.<br>
<br>
However, the son had whisked his parents off to the park in order to make peace with
them.&nbsp;As if peace were so easy.&nbsp; His father sat on a bench next to the son while
the mother sat in her wheelchair. As the two men talked, father and son, she gazed at the
thin man dancing around the monument.&nbsp; He looked like he was in a trance, maybe on
drugs, the mother thought.&nbsp; It seemed as though the man was totally oblivious to
everything going on around him yet somehow demanding the attention of his audience. Had he
not appeared that he came from the slums and that he was not only<br>
on drugs, but a dealer, his movements might even have seemed poetic, instead of tragic.
&nbsp; By his actions he gave the impression that he thought he was on top of the world,
but his actions were deceptive and he looked like he came from the bottom of the pit.<br>
<br>
It was not just the man dancing around the monument that was strange the mother noted.
There was this lady looking even more degenerate than the dancing man.&nbsp; She pushed a
cart before her. At the top of the cart perched a small American flag.&nbsp; Next to the
flag was a black fur coat. The scraggly looking lady parked her cart next to the bench
across from the son and his parents and laid herself down and within moments, began
snoring.&nbsp; Then, along the parkway path, an older man shuffled over to a<br>
neighboring bench with a brown paper bag wrapped around a whisky bottle. He sat there,
also oblivious to whatever his eyes looked at, staring into nothingness, guzzling his
firewater at intervals.&nbsp;&nbsp; Surely he had not bathed in the longest of time.<br>
<br>
Next to the alcoholic who clutched his bagged treasure sat a trio of hip older men.
&nbsp; Men who were out of their generation. Gray-haired men who had never made that great
leap beyond their teenage years.&nbsp; They looked as alcoholic as the man with the brown
paper bag and as degenerate as the dancing man who still danced and as low as the lady
sleeping on the bench.&nbsp; It was on this beautiful summer day to the tune of this
parade of people that the son sat on the bench next to his father, close to his mother in
the wheelchair.&nbsp; Out from nowhere suddenly appeared another lady who was followed by
a mongrel on a leash.&nbsp; In her anger, she had forgotten her mongrel and stomped her
way across the park like a bulldozer, cussing as she walked.&nbsp; All this profanity
poured out of her mouth, all this ugliness poured out of her soul, all these words burst
from her, words that any decent person would never utter.<br>
<br>
Yes, there were flowers of every description growing in ordered rows throughout the park,
and everything emitted freshness and promise.&nbsp; But all the freshness was not man-made
but God-given.&nbsp; Given to spectators unaware of the immensity of such gifts and
uncaring.<br>
<br>
The son opened his mouth to speak while the dancing man continued on whirling around the
monument. &#147;Let what has happened be in the past,&#148; he said looking at his father
then his mother.<br>
<br>
The father&#146;s face reddened. The mother&#146;s face whitened.&nbsp; Then his father
with all the reserve he seemed to be able to muster answered, &#147;What happened is not
so easy to forget, maybe impossible to forgive. I do not want to see your wife as long as
I live. You married her against my will even though I warned you what might happen. You
disobeyed me, you did not listen to me, and everything that happened is a result of your
poor choice of a wife to share your life with.&#148;<br>
<br>
And as he spoke, the last scenarios and last encounters with the son&#146;s wife flashed
through the mother&#146;s mind.&nbsp; She remembered how she had painfully climbed up the
stairs to her son&#146;s apartment with her broken leg to pack her and her husband&#146;s
things out of fear that her daughter-in-law would destroy some of her husband&#146;s
valuable papers.&nbsp; The only proof that he possessed of his age was in the brown
briefcase that<br>
sat in the bedroom the parents had been given by their son during their visit to him.<br>
<br>
The first encounters with the daughter-in-law almost dispelled former conceptions.
&nbsp; Perhaps the niece, now turned daughter-in-law, was kind and sweet after all.
&nbsp; Perhaps she would indeed make their son a good wife, one that would protect his
belongings and help make him a better man, one that would encourage him to retain his
faith and even enhance it. Perhaps they had been too quick to judge her, too harsh in
thinking that she would not be a good wife.&nbsp; During the first week that the parents
were there, she whisked about the house dusting and mopping. She brought them food, not
good food, but food nevertheless. The parents did not complain for as the mother had told
her husband, &#147;She&#146;s young and with time might become an excellent cook.<br>
<br>
It wasn&#146;t really important what they ate after all, but how they were treated that
mattered.&nbsp; And all this changed the day the father tried to bring his two warring
sons together. Son&#146;s that had always gotten along fabulously well until the new
daughter-in-law had separated them and planted hate in her husband&#146;s heart against
his brother.&nbsp; It was for this reason that the visiting father wanted to reconcile his
sons and it was<br>
for this reason that he had gathered them together in his married daughter&#146;s house.
&nbsp; From the onset things went poorly.&nbsp; The new daughter-in-law entered her
husband&#146;s sister&#146;s house with an attitude. Her haughty eyes looked cold and
distant. She stood angrily crossing her arms over her abdomen while her nose sneered down
at the family that she was related to by blood and now by marriage.&nbsp; Though she was
the niece, she still felt herself better than all other members of the family and that day
it showed all too clearly her true feelings.&nbsp; As soon as the two warring sons went to
the dining room to make peace with their father as mediator, the niece rushed in to pull
her husband away, cussing her uncle with, &#147;Damn you and your father,&#148; as she
spat not only the words out but her wrath and hate.<br>
<br>
She pulled her husband, that same husband who now sat in the park with his parents in an
attempt to make peace, to the car parked in front of his sister&#146;s houses and at the
car shouted out further insults, cussing and spitting. The son made no effort to shut his
wife up and they both disappeared into the car swallowed up by a black thunderous cloud of
haughtiness.<br>
<br>
Later, when the mother with the broken leg went to get the belongings of both herself and
her husband, she said to her son, &#147;I am really very concerned about you son. To have
such a wife is very dangerous. Remember, if she does not respect your father, then she
does not respect you either.&#148;<br>
<br>
The son lamely tried to justify his wife&#146;s actions with, &#147;She only did that
because she wanted to protect me.&#148;<br>
<br>
Further warnings were spoken and then, the mother knowing that it was all useless, took
her belongings and began to go down the stairs when she suddenly saw her daughter-in-law
whip by with her nose even higher in the air.&nbsp; Seeing this the mother said,
&#147;Well thank you and good-bye.&#148;<br>
<br>
But as she painfully climbed back down the stairs she heard her daughter-in-law rushing
towards her and then got hit by the clothes that her daughter-in-law threw at her. As if
this was not enough, the daughter-in-law screamed at her, &#147;Get out, get out of
here.&#148;<br>
<br>
The sweet thing had turned into a wild insane animal with no control. Something clicked in
the mother&#146;s mind and she went back upstairs saying to the crazed animal before her,
&#147;No, this is my son&#146;s house and I will not get out.&#148;<br>
<br>
But the daughter-in-law tried to throw herself on the mother in a frenzied attack,
spitting out more vulgar words and profanity. It was all too wild and shocking. It was all
the son could do to keep his wife from hitting his mother.&nbsp; The mother finally
decided that to leave was better than stay around for further abuse.<br>
<br>
That day in the park all she could do was tell her son about the story of the prophet
Abraham and how when he went to visit his son&#146;s house, his first daughter-in-law
opened the door. She did not invite her father-in-law in and all she could do was complain
about her husband. The prophet was offered no food, no comfort. He told his
daughter-in-law, &#147;When my son comes home, tell him that his father sends him his
greetings and to change the entrance of his house.&#148;<br>
<br>
The next time Prophet Abraham visited his son, he was met by a new daughter-in-law. She
was very polite to him and fixed the best meal she could and offered it to him.&nbsp; She
was humble, respectful and a blessing to any who knew her.&nbsp; Prophet Abraham told her,
&#147;When my son comes home, please give him my greetings and tell him that I tell him to
take care of the entrance of his home.&#148;<br>
<br>
What the prophet meant the first visit to his son&#146;s house was that the first wife was
no good and that his son should get rid of her, but the next time he visited his
son&#146;s house, he told his son&#146;s second wife to tell her husband to keep his wife.<br>
<br>
The talk in the park went just about nowhere.&nbsp; The son could not see how wrong his
wife was, how disrespectful she had been to both his parents and what a curse she would be
to him if she remained this way.&nbsp; Yet he spoke of peace and asked his parents to
forget all that had happened.<br>
<br>
As the trio left the scenario in the park, the dancing man, the guy with the whisky
wrapped in a brown paper bag, the lady sleeping on the bench, the dogs walking their
owners, the mother did not think it would be easy to forget or forgive what had happened.
She now knew for certain that her daughter-in-law was evil, not just bad, but evil and
that she had tried her best and succeeded in not only making the two brothers hate each
other because of the lies that she told, but hated her husband&#146;s whole family as well
and wanted to keep her husband as far away from his family<br>
as possible. She had been quite victorious. His parents were out of their son&#146;s house
and he was more distant from his brothers and sisters than he had previously been. But
when the daughter-in-law&#146;s parents had been visiting, things had been totally
different. They had been treated like royalty.<br>
<br>
The scariest thing was that though the parents were now no longer staying with their son,
their son had chosen such a woman to be his wife. Surely not a religious woman who
respected her husband&#146;s family, but a shrew who had so much hate for all her
husband&#146;s family and thought herself so much better than everyone.&nbsp;The scary
thing was that no matter how poorly the daughter-in-law had treated her husband&#146;s
parents and how she had even hit and scratched her own husband at different intervals, he
could not clearly see at all what a mess he had gotten himself into.&nbsp; He was as<br>
oblivious to his own predicament as the dancing guy on drugs and the alcoholic who guzzled
his addiction from the brown paper bag and the snoring lady sleeping on the bench in
broadlight.&nbsp; </font></font></p>
