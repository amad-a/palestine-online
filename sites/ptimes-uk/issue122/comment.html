<h3 ALIGN="CENTER"><font color="#0000FF">Futile Approach</font></h3>
</b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority seems to have learned little from past
disasters, both recent and in the past. Indeed, a sketchy glimpse at the way the PA
leadership has been dealing with the present U.S.-tax funded Jewish rampage against the
Palestinian people, who are eager to rid themselves of 33 years of nightmarish Israeli
occupation and apartheid, shows that the PA is making the very same blunders which had
brought innumerous disasters on the Palestinian people and caused irreparable damage to
their just cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is a hopelessly miserable approach that preoccupies itself with
modalities, procedural issues, symptoms and secondary aspects of the conflict with the
Zionists often at the expense of the fundamental issue, namely the Zionist occupation and
usurpation of Palestine, which is the original sin and root-cause of violence and
instability in the Middle East.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, one cannot help being affronted by this futile posture on the part
of the PA, which devotes disproportionate attention and energy to such secondary matters
as the Mitchell Committee Report, the Tenet recommendations, the deployment of observers
and other similarly petty issues, the accentuation of which could lead to the obfuscation
of the crux of the matter&#151;the continued Zionist military occupation in utter
disregard of international laws and norms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is very disturbing, indeed, to hear PA officials, from Arafat downward,
parroting their monotonous assertions about the need to abide by the recommendations of
the Mitchell Committee Report (which effectively equated Zionist terror with Palestinian
resistance) and the so-called Tenet work plan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, one can understand the harshness of the political environment in the
world today, with the Zionist-controlled America calling the shots.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, one should equally understand that there is absolutely no point
or merit in continuing to count on a possible reawakening of American conscience. That
conscience died a long time ago. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, it would be utterly naïve to appeal to the so-called American
sense of justice. An America that has just caused the death of nearly a million Iraqi
children because of her obsessive desire to get rid of one man can&#146;t be expected to
do justice to the Palestinian people. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In short, the Zionist grip on the American political establishment (and
media) has dried up any sense of justice and moral ethics in a country that once prided
herself on being a light upon the nations of the earth. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But the &#147;light upon a hill&#148; eventually turned into an
abomination a long time ago, and for the Palestinians, at least, America became a symbol
of oppression and evil. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And it continues to be so.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Now, should the PA leadership go on in deceiving itself and the
Palestinian people by hoping (the correct word is &#147;wishing&#148;) that the U.S. would
eventually exert pressure on Israel? Doesn&#146;t Arafat and his coterie of advisors and
aides, many of whom lived and worked in the U.S. for a long time, understand that the
relation between Israel and the U.S. is like that between the &#147;organ grinder&#148;
and the &#147;monkey&#148;, whereby Israel and its Zionist allies dictate things and even
on occasion hector and cajole U.S. presidents into violating American law itself in order
to serve Jewish-Zionist interests?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In light, the PA is demanded to seek an alternative approach to deal with
America&#146;s enduring hostility against our people and our just cause.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There are many steps the PA can take in this regard, provided it has the
moral courage to call the spade a spade, even if this would prove to be politically (and
especially financially) inexpedient for the time being.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first step toward or adopting a meaningful approach to American
hostility begins with Arafat putting an end to his meaningless utterances about the
alleged &#147;honest broker&#148; and similar vacuous remarks. America can&#146;t be
honest when it comes to Palestine. This should be amply clear to even the politically
illiterate, let alone to veterans like Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Instead, the chairman should begin immediately to face the Arab and Muslim
masses with the fact of brash American hostility and the need to confront this hostility
with whatever means available.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nobody is suggesting that Arab nations ought to bear arms and go to war
against the last remaining superpower. This is beyond the power of the chronically
despotic and scandalously impotent Arab regimes.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But America has extensive strategic, economic and business interests in
more than 50 Arab and Islamic countries. The size of American exports to the Arab world
alone exceeds $50 billion a year.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must tell Arab and Islamic regimes that they are effectively silent
culprits in the ongoing Zionist-American genocide against our people, if only by
continuing business as usual with the U.S, while utterly ignoring and disregarding wanton
American support of the criminal Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We must tell them in unequivocal terms that their subservience to America
encourages her to maintain her hostility to the Palestinian people and Arab national
interests as a whole.</p>
