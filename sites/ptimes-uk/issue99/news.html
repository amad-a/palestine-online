<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Has Hamas decided to resume attacks on Israel?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After a self-imposed moratorium lasting nearly ten months, the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas) has apparently decided to resume armed attacks on Israeli
occupation targets, particularly Israeli soldiers and settlers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The unannounced decision to that effect has found expression in a series
of recent shootings and ambushes in the West Bank and in pre-1967 Palestine in which at
least one Israeli man was killed and a dozen settlers and soldiers wounded, some
seriously.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The most serious of these attacks occurred on 10 August when Akram Alkam,
a 23-year-old Palestinian youth from a Bethlehem refugee camp, rammed his car into a group
of Israeli soldiers awaiting to be lifted to their bases, injuring eight soldiers before
he was himself shot dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The suicide-driver, as the Israeli media referred to him, didn&#146;t have
any &#147;formal&#148; affiliation with Hamas. However, a strong whiff of the
movement&#146;s influence was sufficiently clear in his behaviour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One Islamist Friday speaker praised Alkam as &#147;a martyr who
couldn&#146;t bear living in perpetual oppression.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas eventually did take credit for the martyrdom operation. The Ezzidin
al-Qassam Brigades mourned Alkam as &#147;one of our mujahideen (or fighters for justice
and freedom).&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the fact that ordinary, un-indoctrinated Palestinians like Alkam
were willing to carry out &#147;martyrdom operations&#148; and with their own meagre
means, should be viewed as a striking success for Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The movement, after all, can now boast of succeeding in transforming
&#147;martyrdom&#148; from a political faction&#146;s monopoly into a popular practice,
which makes it all the more difficult for Israel and, for that matter, its subservient
puppet entity, Yasser Arafat&#146;s PA, to control future attacks against Zionist targets.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas takes credit for operation</b></u><br>
The Hamas military wing, Ezzidin al-Qassam Brigades, did take credit for at least one
attack: the shooting incident in the Old Town of Hebron in early August in which two
Jewish settlers were wounded. (Hamas&#146; military wing has been undergoing an arduous
rebuilding and restructuring process following the killing of a number of its top leaders
by Israeli soldiers and undercover agents in the last few years.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other three incidents, including one near the northern West Bank town
of Jenin, in which an Israeli immigrant from the former Soviet Union, an air-craft
designer, was killed, are also believed to have been carried out by Hamas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An ostensible fourth attack was aborted when an explosive device went off
inside a storehouse in the Hawuz neighbourhood in Hebron on 15 August. PA police said two
Islamist brothers, who had been released from Israeli jails after serving a five-year jail
sentence for belonging to Hamas, were preparing a plastic toy-car bomb attack for
detonation at an Israeli settlement site in downtown Hebron.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas denied PA assertions, saying the whole incident was concocted by the
PA to find a pretext to round up Hamas supporters in Hebron in exchange for Israel
agreeing to free hundreds of Fatah prisoners from Israeli jails.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, PA sources described the Hamas denial as a defensive reflex and
largely disingenuous, given the clear connection between the owners and operators of the
storehouse and Hamas.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Peace process threatened by &#147;terrorism&#148;</b></u><br>
So far, the attacks have been relatively minor and generally un-qualitative in nature, but
the message is sufficiently clear for all parties concerned, particularly Israel and the
PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli officials from Barak downward have warned that the peace process
&#147;can&#146;t continue in the shadow of terrorism.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The resumption of terrorism harms Israel and the Palestinian
Authority as well as the peace process, hence we both have a common interest to fight it
and keep it at bay,&#148; said one Israeli official, Ephraeim Sneh, during a visit to the
Gaza Strip on 14 August.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sneh further suggested that Barak wouldn&#146;t be able to sell any
possible concessions to the Palestinians to his right-wing coalition partners, let alone
to the larger Israeli public, in the shadow of terrorism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian Authority has voiced an understandable concern about the
potentially disastrous consequences of a full-fledged resumption of armed attacks,
particularly suicidal bombings, on Israeli targets.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;These attacks put us in a weak position <i>vis-à-vis</i>
Israel,&#148; said PA Minister for Parliamentary Affairs Nabil Amre in a radio interview,
adding &#147;that they further weaken our ability to extract our rights from Israeli
hands.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The attacks, Amre added, could &#147;take us back to a nightmarish
situation similar to that which preceded the election of Netanyahu,&#148; when Hamas
launched a series of lethal suicide bomb attacks in Israel&#146;s urban centres, killing
scores of Israelis and contributing to the downfall of Israel&#146;s then care-taker
premier Shimon Peres.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amre&#146;s remarks came in response to earlier statements by a Hamas
official based in Jordan alleging that renewed attacks on Israel would actually strengthen
the Palestinian negotiating position.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas: Armed resistance will prove beneficial</b></u><br>
Hamas&#146; rationale to that effect stems from the belief that the resumption of armed
resistance against Israel, although tactically detrimental to PA interests for the short
run, will prove beneficial to the overall Palestinian national cause and interests in the
long run.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The resumption of armed struggle against the Zionist entity carries
with it the message that there can be no real peace or stability in this region as long as
the Palestinians don&#146;t receive their dues in full,&#148; said a senior Hamas official
based in Ramallah, who asked for anonymity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked why Hamas would not maintain the moratorium on armed struggled until
after Israel carried out the Wye River memorandum, the Islamist official said, &#147;Barak
couldn&#146;t be given the benefit of the doubt&#133;he already said he would keep
Jerusalem along with the bulk of the West Bank in the context of any final settlement with
the Palestinians&#133;so why should we wait and what for?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But there is more to account for Hamas&#146; option for resuming armed
struggle against Israel than just the movement&#146;s conviction that any final or
semi-final settlement between Israel and the PA will be inherently unfair to the
Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas believes, with ample logic, that Israel has already achieved most or
all of its imperial goals in the West Bank, namely controlling and colonizing the bulk of
the uninhabited lands, and that, in light of the facts, the Zionist State shouldn&#146;t
be allowed to enjoy the arrogation of the Palestinian homeland and peace of mind combined.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More important, however, is the fact that Hamas has probably come to
realize that it no longer has much to lose by renewing attacks on Israeli targets, as the
PA continues to intern hundreds of Islamist activists without charge or trial, apparently
to appease Israel and the United States and to ward off their tendentious charges that the
PA doesn&#146;t combat terrorism effectively.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Islamist officials point to the re-arrest recently of Hamas&#146;
senior spokesman Dr. Abdul Aziz al-Rantisi only two weeks after he was &#147;freed&#148;
to enable him to attend his mother&#146;s funeral, along with the arrest of another
Islamist public figure, Sheikh Ahmed Nimer.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Before his latest re-arrest, Rantisi spent 15 months (without trial) in PA
custody, and had earlier served three years in an Israeli prison for &#147;acting as
Spokesman for the Islamist deportees at Marj al-Zuhour.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas doesn&#146;t place all the blame for these arrests, and, indeed, for
the continued and seemingly open-ended incarceration of its internees in PA custody,
solely on the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel remains the prime and ultimate culprit that forces the PA to act
virtually at its beck and call.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, Hamas reasons, makes armed struggle against Israel inevitable even
if undesirable.</p>

continue torturing Palestinians</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem-</b> The Shin Beth interrogators-torturers reportedly
routinely deceive Israeli courts and Judges for the purpose of avoiding court orders to
end torturing a given Palestinian suspect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Explaining how this deception is done, Israeli sources pointed out that as
soon as a Lawyer representing a Palestinian detainee submitted an appeal to force Shin
Beth torturers to end torturing his or her client, the Shin Beth would inform the court
that &quot;it already stopped applying torture on the client.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This, the sources said, would in turn prompt the court dismiss the appeal
on the ground that the reason for the appeal ceased to exist.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, as soon as the appeal is rejected, the interrogators resumed the
torture as usual.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel is the only country in the world where physical and psychological
torture is sanctioned by the law of the land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Torture is used against Palestinians on a very wide scale for two main
reasons, first to extract confessions from Palestinian inmates, and second as a reprisal
and punishment against Palestinians for their ideas and political beliefs. </p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli court tries 10, 11 years olds</b></u><br>
Meanwhile, an Israeli military court based at the Majnuna army base near Dura, 10 miles
south west of Hebron, began trying as many as twenty Palestinian children on charges
related to throwing stones on Israeli military vehicles. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian and Israeli sources alike said the Zionist court treated the
children, aged 10 and 11 years old, as adults.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The trial of the twenty children, who are residents of the Arroub refugee
camp near north of Hebron, has been denounced by the International Society for the
protection of children.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Khalid Quzmar, who heads the society's chapter in the West Bank, said the
prosecution of children in this age is a vile act.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He pointed out that the children wouldn't have been dragged to a military
court had they been Jewish.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Zionist regime, however, is normally deaf to international criticisms
of its racist and often murderous policy toward Palestinians, especially children. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak said Israel
wouldn't release Palestinian prisoners who &quot;have Jewish blood on their hands,&quot; a
reference to Palestinian guerillas who killed Zionist soldiers or settlers in the course
of the Palestinian struggle.<br>
The Israeli media quoted Barak as saying that his government would be willing to release
no more than 250 prisoners.<br>
The PA demands the release of 650 prisoners, arguing that the Wye agreement stipulated
their release.<br>
The successive Israeli government have bamboozled the PA on the prisoners' issue by
interning hundreds of innocent Palestinians as &quot;reserve prisoners&quot; to be release
in implementation of agreements with the PA.<br>
Moreover, Israeli normally resorted to releasing car thieves and petty criminal while
keeping Palestinian fighters behind bars.<br>
The PA has been powerless to do any thing to force the Zionist regime to honor the Wye
agreement.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA official: &#147;Zionists don&#146;t respect
agreements&#148;</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> &#150; <b>Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite his repeated public statements and assurances that he will carry
out the Wye agreement in full, the Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has been equivocating
and prevaricating in implementing the agreement, which even his Likudist predecessor
Benyamin Netanyahu had described as &#147;a good agreement for Israel.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Initially, Barak proposed to the Palestinians that key sections of the Wye
River Memorandum be merged with the final status settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, sensing &#147;foul play&#148; on his part, the PA rejected the
proposal, insisting on the &#147;the full, honest and accurate implementation of the
agreement.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli premier then suggested that the third phase of redeployment
that is stipulated in the Wye agreement, or at least sections of it, be carried out along
with the final status settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA negotiators, who apparently had been wheedled into agreeing to
reopening the Wye agreement, effectively renegotiating it on terms that are more
favourable to the Barak government, rejected this proposal, too, on the basis that it
amounted to evading and circumventing the honest implementation of the agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These talks, which included marathon meetings suggesting the two sides
&#147;meant business,&#148; did not produce any agreement on the main contentious issues,
namely the land and the prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the first issue, Palestinian and Israeli sources alike indicated that
Barak was retreating from the terms of the Wye agreement which stipulated the transfer of
more land from joint Israeli-Palestinian control (area B) to exclusive Palestinian
control.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli sources pointed out on 25 August that Barak was not keen on
transferring more land to exclusive Palestinian control since this would undermine
Israel&#146;s negotiating position in the final status talks.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Wye agreement stipulates that Israel should transfer 13% of land under
its exclusive control (area C) to joint control (area B) (this is in reality under
Israel&#146;s real control since the Israeli army enjoys <i>carte blanche</i> to arrest
Palestinians and raid their homes day and night).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The agreement also stipulates the hand-over of security responsibility to
the PA in another 14.2% of territory presently under joint control (area B).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other issue&#151;the prisoners&#151;no real progress was reported
after a series of meetings between PA top negotiator Sa&#146;eb Ereikat and the Israeli
lawyer Gilad Sher. (Israeli negotiators are mostly lawyers not politicians.)</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hisham Abdul Razeq, the PA official in charge of the talks, reportedly
described them as &#147;a waste of time.&#148; He accused the Israeli government of
dealing with the issue not as part of an agreement to be implemented but as a separate
subject that can be dealt with through a fudge-and-compromise approach.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They want to take the prisoner issue out of its political
context,&#148; Abdul Razeq was quoted as saying on 25 August.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Razeq said Israel was only proposing to release 250 political
prisoners (former fighters who carried out acts of resistance against the Zionist
occupation) out of the 650 prisoners stipulated in the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An Israeli official was quoted as saying that the number of &#147;security
prisoners&#148; that could be released did not exceed 250 since the large majority of
prisoners were from Hamas or other Palestinian fighting organizations critical of the Oslo
process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One frustrated Palestinian official who has been following up the talks on
the prisoners had this to say about the Israeli approach to the issue.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Israelis don&#146;t see agreements with us as binding, hence,
the implementation of a given agreement needs another agreement which in turn requires a
third agreement, and in each case additional concessions from us are extracted.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA official went on to say, &#147;and when they do carry out an
agreement, or a clause in an agreement, they view this as a gesture of goodwill toward us,
not as an obligation and something that is binding on them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The official added, with bitterness, that &#147;our experience with the
Israeli negotiators proves the Qur&#146;anic description of Jews as people who do not
fulfil their covenants and promises, especially when made to non-Jews.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the Qur&#146;an states in chapter II, verse 100: &#147;Is it not
(the case) that every time they make a covenant, some party among them throws it aside?
Nay, the truth is most of them believe not.&#148;</p>
<u><i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Agreements after agreements</b></i></u><br>
In addition to reneging on the implementation of the two most fundamental issues of the
Wye River memorandum, the Israeli government has also sought to break down the agreement
into smaller parts, each of which requires intensive negotiation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Thus, agreements had to be negotiated and reached on the reopening of
Shuhada Street in Hebron, the seaport in Gaza, the southern safe passage from Gaza to
Tarqymya, the northern passage from Gaza to Betunya, the entry of Palestinian workers to
Israel, the extradition of Palestinians wanted by Israel, in addition to a host of
economic issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One observer noted that if the implementation of an essentially
non-fundamental agreement, such as the Wye memorandum, takes all this time, effort and is
fraught with all these complications, reaching a final status settlement with Israel would
take at least a thousand years!!</p>

Meanwhile, U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright is expected to arrive in Palestine
on 2 September in an effort to activate the Palestinian-Israeli track as well as revive
the Syrian Israeli-track.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright, who was supposed to make her visit on 15 August, had postponed
her arrival in the region at the Israeli Prime Minister&#146;s request, ostensibly to give
him more time to cajole Yasser Arafat into accepting an &#147;amended form&#148; of the
Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright&#146;s visit to the region is not expected to produce
&#147;magical results,&#148; given the cordial relations between the Clinton
administration and the Israeli premier.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This relation, many pundits believe, serves to impede meaningful American
pressure on Barak and effectively enable the Israeli premier to get away with the kind of
&#147;excesses&#148; that even Benyamin Netanyahu didn&#146;t get away with.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright is thus unlikely to exert genuine pressure on Barak to carry out
clauses related to prisoner releases with the Palestinians, as stipulated in the attached
annex to the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This prospect has aroused Palestinian anxiety.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA official Nabil Sha&#146;ath complained on 24 August that the United
States was giving Barak more time to carry out the agreement than that which had been
given to Netanyahu.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Sha&#146;ath repeated routine Palestinian demands that the U.S. take an
impartial role in the peace process and get Israel to implement the agreements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One possible scenario is that Barak will start carrying out the Wye
agreement irrespective of the Palestinian views and possible American reservations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, Barak could implement the agreement in accordance with his
own interpretation of its clauses and take into account unilateral Israeli amendments of
some of its key sections, particularly those related to the third phase of redeployment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not clear how the PA would react if Barak did just that.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the past, the PA made resonant objections to unilateral Israeli actions
to that effect, which amounted to an incomplete and a dishonest implementation of
outstanding agreements.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, after coming under little American pressure, and perhaps some
&#147;persuasion from some Arab capitals,&#148; the PA leadership soon retreated and caved
in to the Israeli <i>fait accompli</i>.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, in light of the PA acceptance to re-negotiate the Wye agreement
(under the false rubric of discussing implementation modalities), there is sufficient
ground to assume that this time won&#146;t be any different.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- The Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas) has
renewed its fierce opposition to any talks or dialogue that could lead to recognition of
the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas Gaza official Mahmud Al Zahar said in a newspaper interview
published Thursday that the Islamist movement would never take part in any dialogue, or a
broad Palestinian front, or even a national unity government based on the two-states
solution and the recognition of the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an interview with the London-based daily newsletter &quot;Mideast
Mirror,&quot; Zahar stressed that Hamas' position to that effect was a matter of
principles, saying &quot;we base our position on religious rather than political
convictions.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;The land of Palestine is Wakf. We are the custodians of Palestine on
behalf of the all Muslims,&quot; he said.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zahar said Hamas was not against national unity talks among Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, he said that Palestinian national unity ought to be above Oslo
not below it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He told the London newsletter that Hamas had not yet been invited to meet
with the PA, adding that the Islamist movement would consider its response once such an
invitation is presented.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most, if not all Muslim scholars all over the world, are unanimous in
their rejection of the concept of recognizing the Zionist regime since it was founded on
oppression, injustice and the usurpation of a Muslim people's rights.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Researcher: There is enough room <br>
for Palestine refugees in their homeland!</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ramallah (West Bank)-</b> Some 500 Palestinian refugees met on two
consecutive days with Palestinian researcher Dr. Salman Abu Sitta in order to explore the
relevance of his research on the Palestinian right of return for a broad popular movement
in defense of Palestinian refugee rights. The two meetings conducted under the headline,
&quot;The Return of Palestinian Refugees is Legal, Possible, and the Only Way to a Just
Peace in the Middle East&quot;, were organized by the BADIL Friends Forum and the
Committee for the Defense of Palestinian Refugee Rights/Yafa <br>
Cultural Center, in cooperation with the Popular Services Committees of the PLO Department
of Refugee Affairs in Deheishe refugee camp/Bethlehem (24 August) and Balata refugee
camp/Nablus (25 August). <br>
Focal points raised by Dr. Salman Abu Sitta and discussed by the audience were:<br>
1. The importance of knowledge of the facts pertaining to the Palestinian refugee
question, such as: a) precise understanding of UN Resolution 194 as pertaining both to the
right of return and the right to compensation; b)awareness of the broad body of
international law supporting refugees' right of return and property rights while rejecting
measures of ethnic cleansing; c)knowledge of the demographic map of Israel which shows
that 78 percent of the Jews in Israel live on 15 percent of the territory, while the
majority of Palestinian refugee land is, until today, basically empty and controlled by
some 154,000 rural Jews, mainly Kibbutzim and Moshavim. Dr. Abu Sitta drew attention to
the fact that the number of Palestinian refugees currently exiled in Lebanon and Gaza is
equal to the number of Jewish immigrants from the former Soviet Union and Ethiopia
absorbed by Israel since 1989, a fact which totally delegitimizes the Israeli argument
that refugee return was impossible due to lack of physical space.<br>
2. The legitimacy of the refugees struggle for the right of return, irrespective of the
outcome of the political negotiations between Israel and the PLO, a legitimacy which will
remain as long as Palestinian refugees are denied the right of return and access to their
properties.<br>
3. The fact those Palestinian refugees must constitute the backbone and source of energy
of any struggle for refugee rights that aims to obtain credibility and success. The
formation of a strong refugee lobby will enable Palestinian refugees to take advantage of
political and legal avenues opening up for pressure groups in the frame of international
human rights law in the 21st century.</p>

<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- The Palestinian Authority is reportedly planing to
open a new casino in Ramallah, the second in the self-rule areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Hebrew newspaper, Ma'ariv, quoted unnamed PA officials as saying that
the new casino will be &quot;more classy&quot; than the Jericho casino, known as al Waha,
or the oasis.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ma'ariv said the new casino would attract gamblers from Tel Aviv and other
central Palestine towns, given their geographic proximity to Ramallah.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdul Jawad Saleh, a Palestinian Legislative Council member representing
Ramallah, described plans to open a new casino in his town as &quot;a new crime to be
added to the crime of al Waha.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;There are certain people who trying to convert our homeland into a
gambling casino,&quot; said Saleh in a clear allusion to PA chairman Yaser Arafat and the
close net of economic aides and advisers around him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Saleh pointed out that the Palestinian Authority was making a
&quot;commercial enterprise&quot; of Palestine, saying, &quot;the masses should rise up
against this decadent band of money-grabbing careerists.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, human rights groups in the self-rule enclaves complained that
countries of the European union were &quot;encouraging corruption and misuse of public
money and property throughout the Palestinian authority.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A human rights activist, who monitors PA compliance with the rule of law,
pointed out that many of the cars and vehicles donated by EU countries to the PA are used
as &quot;private cars&quot; by Fatah activists and other supporters of Palestinian
Authority President Yaser Arafat.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The worker, Iyad Ibrahim, cited the example of how many Volkswagen cars
donated by the government of Germany for the Palestinian Central Election Committee were
being used as &quot;private cars&quot; on the streets of the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ibrahim called on the EU to make sure that PA set clear guidelines between
the public and private domain, irrespective of political loyalties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ibrahim also urged the EU to make sure that PA officials do not embezzle
its contributions to the Palestinian judicial and justice system.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Asked about the current status of the PA justice system a new Attorney
General was appointed, Ibrahim said, &quot;there has been no appreciable change so
far.&quot;</p>

because Hamas controls student unions</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> Palestinian universities and colleges of higher
education, which have been hit by a severe financial crisis, have been told by the PA to
&quot;fix your finances&quot; and that &quot;your problems are none of our business,&quot;
related an informed source in the Palestinian Higher Education Council.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The source asked for anonymity and said the declared reason for the PA
refusal to bail out the universities was &quot;lack of funds&quot; and the discontinuation
of European Union subsidies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the source added that the real reason, in his opinion, was PA
Chairman Yasser Arafat's displeasure with the colleges for &quot;allowing&quot; Hamas to
control virtually all student unions at Palestinian colleges and universities.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The source argued that Arafat, the sole decision maker in the Palestinian
Authority, demanded political loyalty (at all levels) from the universities in return for
PA subsidies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the source, when presidents of Palestinian colleges and
universities told Arafat recently that they had no control over student elections and that
there was no way they could prevent a given student movement or bloc from winning an
election, Arafat reportedly told them &quot;You can't have money and Hamas at the same
time.&quot;</p>

We'll break their arms and legs</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> A Jewish settler leader in the West Bank
threatened activists associated with the Peace Now movement with &quot;breaking their arms
and legs&quot; during the month of July.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ron Nahman, a Knesset member affiliated with the Zionist far right,
reportedly threatened to break Peace Now activists' arms and legs if they continued to
demonstrate against the expansion of Jewish settlements in the Occupied Territories.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to the Hebrew press, Nahman maintained that he was imitating a
threat made by the former Israeli premier Yitzhak Rabin against Palestinian intifada
activists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nahman's sabre-rattling came after Peace Now accused the settlers of
&quot;acting as night thieves&quot; by continuing to build and expand Jewish settlements
at the expense of Palestinian land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources have indicated that Jewish settlement activities are
continuing at the same pace that existed during the Netanyahu government.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it seems that Ehud Barak has the privilege of incurring little
negative publicity compared to Netanyahu, although the policy on settlements remained
virtually unchanged. </p>

continue hunger strike</b></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b>- Hundreds of Palestinian prisoners and detainees in
the Zionist prison of Askalan started on 20 August an open-ended hunger strike to protest
Israeli refusal to release them in implementation of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian sources said the prisoners warned the PA leadership against
&quot;giving any concessions to the Zionists at our expense.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&quot;Our nightmare has continued for too long, so long that we demand
that the PA and Palestinian negotiators place our just cause at the top of the national
priority ladder,&quot; said the prisoners in a letter smuggled from the Askalan jail.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, another 700 prisoners at the Nafha prison began a hunger strike
in solidarity with their comrades at the Askalan prison.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The prisoners are also angry at the Israeli policy of using them as
&quot;hostages&quot; or &quot;bargaining chips&quot; in the ongoing talks with the PA over
the implementation of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So far, Israel and the PA have failed to agree on the number of prisoners
to be released as part of the implementation of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The agreement stipulated the release of 750 prisoners, but Israel has
refused to release the stipulated number, saying it can's release that many, especially
those who have &quot;Jewish blood&quot; on their hands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli pretext is denounced as bluntly racist since the hands of tens
of thousands of Israelis, soldiers and civilian s alike, are soaked in Palestinian and
Arab blood. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the other hand, Palestinian private organizations in cooperation with
the Palestine Prisoner's Club held on 29 August the National Conference in solidarity with
the prisoners at the Rashad al Shaw'wa convention center in Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The conference aimed at highlighting the enduring cause of the prisoners
at a time when the Israeli regime is using this emotional issue as a bargaining chip in
talks with the PA over the implementation of the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hisham Abdul Raziq, who is responsible for the prisoners&#146; portfolio,
said the Zionist regime was still refusing to free 650 prisoners whose release is
stipulated in the Wye agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said the prisoners cause was at the top of the PA national priority,
adding that the Palestinian leadership was rejecting Israeli classifications of the
prisoners in accordance with their political affiliation.</p>

the role of a submissive servant for the Zionists.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The function of Arafat,&#148; said Amleh, &#147;is to arrest, punish
and humiliate the real freedom-fighters and Mujahideen who still have the courage to say
no to the Zionist occupation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Amleh said the PLO of today is a one-man organization, adding that Arafat
was the one who appoints members to the various PLO institutions, including the Palestine
National Council.</p>

<p align="left"><b>Occupied Jerusalem</b>- A Jewish rabbi has described as &quot;idol
worship&quot; the holding of public prayer by Jews at the Wailing Wall in Jerusalem.<br>
The rabbi, Yahoram Mezour, Secretary-General of the Progressive Judaism Council, said in
an interview with the inaugural edition of the council's magazine (Btalim) that no
sanctity should be attached to the wailing wall.<br>
He described Jewish attachment to the wall as a form of idol worship. <br>
&quot;There is really no holiness to this wall, it is a support wall erected by the
Romans, and there we meet people who pray at a site they made it holy themselves.&quot;<br>
The Israeli minister for religious affairs, Shlomo Ben Ezri, castigated the Mezour saying
he proved he was not Jewish.<br>
&quot;I praised God for hearing these words which prove that the reformists believed in
another religion,&quot; said Ben Ezri, adding, &quot;progressive Judaism is not Judaism
but another religion.&quot;<br>
It is worth mentioning that orthodox followers routinely clash with the followers of the
other two sects of Judaism, the reform and conservatives, at the Wailing Wall.<br>
On May occasions, the Orthodox threw dirty objects and even dragged the reformists and
conservatives out of the Wailing Wall plaza, accusing them of heresy and apostasy. </p>
