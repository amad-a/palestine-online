<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Chairman of the Palestinian Authority, Yasser Arafat, whose standing
among Palestinians&#151;whether at home or in the Diaspora&#151;has reached an all-time
low, is now trying to revive the virtually moribund and widely discredited Palestine
Liberation Organization.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">His efforts to that effect have so far bred some progress, in particular
the two meetings between Arafat and leaders from the two main leftist PLO factions, namely
the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP) and its one-time ideological
sister, the Democratic Front for the Liberation of Palestine (DFLP) headed by Nayef
Hawatmeh. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The two meetings, which took place in Cairo recently, ended with generally
worded statements stressing the need for Palestinian national unity and reiterating, in a
less emphatic manner, the reference to the peace process, including United Nations
resolutions 242 and 338 and also resolution 194 with regards to the refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not certain what prompted Arafat to make the eleventh-hour effort,
which some observers believe is very belated, if not utterly too late. However, it is
amply clear that his ostensible openness to the main secular opposition has less to do
with genuine national unity considerations and more to do with the Chairman's interest in
finding someone to share his accumulated and gigantic failures.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PLO Chairman, who only five years ago told the Palestinian people that
by the end of the interim agreement on 4 May 1999 he would be in control of over 90% of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip, can only now boast of two truncated bantustans, miserably
cut off from each other and having virtually no life of their own. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Arafat has found himself presiding over a ramshackled and
inherently corrupt regime that has more in common with gangs and drug cartels than with
respectable regimes governed by the rule of law. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, Arafat's regime has unashamedly assumed the role of a
quisling that acts at the beck and call of Israel and the CIA. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the continued internment of hundreds of Palestinian citizens
without charge or trial in his fortified prisons and detention centres provides ample
evidence to his submissive subservience to the Zionists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All this served to transform Arafat in the eyes and minds of his people
from a revolutionary leader struggling to restore his people's rights to a mere
collaborator with the enemy who is surrounded by insatiable money-careerists and
hangers-on looking for their immediate financial interests. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With this background in mind, one becomes better prepared to put Arafat's
overtures toward the opposition in the proper perspective. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No truly patriotic and dignified movement should hasten to laud Arafat
without making sure beforehand that he is sincere about national unity and that he would
not back away from his commitments as he has always done.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that Arafat should not be given the benefit of the doubt, but
nor should he be allowed to &quot;play it alone,&quot; since this could spell a greater
disaster than that which the opposition strives to avoid.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The opposition, particularly the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas),
should put Arafat to the test in ways with which it would be difficult for Arafat, who is
notorious for his mercurial character, to back down when and if he deemed necessary.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat says he will observe and never cross &quot;the sacred red
lines,&quot; namely the complete Israeli evacuation from all Palestinian territories
seized in the 1967 war, the establishment of a Palestinian State with East Jerusalem as
its capital, and the return of the refugees. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This should be acceptable from Arafat, the &quot;pragmatist,&quot;
although under no circumstances should an Islamic movement render a long-lasting
recognition of the Zionist regime, even in return for full withdrawal from the West Bank
and Gaza.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The important thing now is to make sure that Arafat will not evade or
deviate from these red lines. His words, promises and pledges alone will not be
sufficient. They are not worth much, anyway.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There must be real guarantees that he won't revert to his characteristic
theatrical acts of betrayal, treachery and conspiratorial manoeuvres. Ways must be found
to ascertain his compliance, and in case that proves impossible, the opposition should not
play the game in accordance with Arafat's rules.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Finally, Arafat must be challenged to prove his goodwill toward the
Palestinian people, which he claims to serve.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat must demonstrate by deeds, not just by words (his words don't mean
anything), that he is not a Zionist tool and that he values the legitimacy that comes from
his people more than that which comes from Israeli and CIA acceptance. And the proper way
to do that is by releasing those &quot;hostages&quot; whose internment serves no practical
purpose save pleasing and appeasing the enemy.</p>
