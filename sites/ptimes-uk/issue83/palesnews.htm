<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Deir Yassin remembered</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (Palestine Times)</FONT></B><FONT
 SIZE=+1> - In the context of commemorating the Nakba (Arabic for Catastrophe),
which takes place parallel with Israel's ostentatious and high-profile celebrations
of its 50th anniversary, Palestinians have been marking the 50th anniversary
of the Deir Yassin massacre.  On 14 April, a memorial meeting organized
by the &quot;Deir Yassin Memorial Society&quot; was held in East Jerusalem.
Participants included Arab and Jewish political activists, historians, and
representatives of the diplomatic corps, as well as a few survivors who
painstakingly recounted their nightmarish experience 50 years ago on 9 April,
when members of two Jewish paramilitary groups, the Irgun and Stern murdered,
en mass, around 250 men, women and children in the peaceable Arab village.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Speakers stressed the landmark status of the massacre in
contemporary Palestinian history, as it represented the general pattern
employed toward the Palestinians--first by the Jewish terrorist groups and
later by the Israeli State. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;The massacre was a stark but representative example
of the Israeli policy toward our people,&quot; said Yousef al Qazaz, a noted
broadcaster and writer.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>He added that the Deir Yassin genocide was followed by
similar grisly massacres at Kufr Kassem, Dawaymeh, Kibya, Eyun Kara, Sabra
and Shatilla, Hebron and Kana, which showed the Zionists were emulating
their former oppressors.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Lea Tsemel, an outspoken Jewish critic of Israeli racism
towards the Palestinians, pointed out that the massacre of Deir Yassin was
a deliberate evil act on the part of the Zionist leadership aimed at &quot;casting
terror into the hearts of the Arabs for the purpose of driving them away
in order to accommodate Jews.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;Deir Yassin was not the only village decimated and
obliterated...As many as 400 Arab villages were systematically destroyed,&quot;
she said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Dr. Hasan Silwadi, Dean of the Jerusalem Arab College,
refuted the oft-repeated Israeli claims that the massacre was an isolated
incident in the &quot;war of liberation.&quot; He quoted several Israeli
historians, like Aryeh Yitshaki and Bney Morris, who admitted (belatedly)
that the massacre was part of a premeditated plan aimed at liquidating the
Arab majority around Jerusalem as well as in the Palestinian midland.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Silwadi pointed out that the massacre was a key factor
in the escape of hundreds of thousands of Palestinians from their towns
and villages who thought that what happened at Deir Yasin would happen to
them if they stayed. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The participants were brought to tears when a survivor
of the massacre, Haja Zaynab Aqel (um Salah), recounted how her father and
three children were gunned down and how she herself was going to face the
same fate had she not pretended to be dead.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Latter on, Um Salah, along with some participants, commuted
to the site of the massacre at Deir Yassin, now renamed Giva'at Shaul.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>There the Israeli authorities have obliterated all but
a few vestiges of what was once a prosperous Arab village. However, Um Salah's
home, where her father and three children were butchered before her eyes
by the Irgun terrorists, is still intact. The occupant of the premise, a
pharmacist, emerged shouting at Um Salah, who was at that time deeply in
tears, &quot;Who are you and what do you want?&quot; &quot;Nothing,&quot;
she said, &quot;nothing.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Larry Collins and Dominique Lapierre, the
Deir Yassin genocide was &quot;a deliberate act aimed at frightening the
Arabs into fleeing the area.&quot; Even Menachem Begin, one of Israel's
arch terrorists, describes the massacre in his book, The Revolt, on pages
164-65, as &quot;the biggest miracle to take place in the war of liberation
because it made the Palestinians flee...&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Interestingly, Deir Yassin was only one massacre out of
many, as the list of Jewish atrocities of the helpless Palestinian people
is too long to be described in one article or even in one book.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Over 500,000 Palestinians arrested by Israelis
since 1967</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> The International Solidarity
for Human Rights issued a report that the Israeli occupation authorities
have arrested about 535,000 Palestinians between 1967 and 1987. It added
that more than 3,000 Palestinians are presently being held in Israeli jails.
The Palestinian human rights group released the following details and figures
regarding Palestinian detainees:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> * Israel arrested about 175,000 Palestinians during the
years of the intifadah (1987-1994)</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  * 12,500 Palestinians have been arrested since the signing
of the Oslo Accords on 13 September 1993</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  * 10,500 Palestinians have been arrested since the signing
in Cairo of the Oslo 2 agreement on 4 May 1994</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>  * 6,000 Palestinians were held in custody at the time
of the signing of the Taba agreement on 28 September 1995</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> * 114 Palestinians have died in Israeli jails since the
occupation in June of 1967 of the West Bank and Gaza Strip</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> * Ali Awadh Jamal of Jenin, north of the West Bank, spent
the longest period of administrative detention (without trial), which lasted
for 6 years and 9 months. He was released in March of 1982, but remained
under house arrest until February of 1984.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> * Khalil Al Ra'e of Gaza is the senior Palestinian prisoner
in Israeli jails. He has been serving a life imprisonment sentence since
March of 1974</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> * The eldest Palestinian detainee is Mohammed Nu'erat
of Maithalon near Jenin. He was born in 1929. He has been serving a life

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Liberty Calls for Protection of Palestinians
from Israel and PA</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>London-PT</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1></FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World expressed its concern over
the fate of hundreds of detainees in Palestinian Authority (PA) jails, saying
that past experience has shown that PA interrogators do not hesitate to
kill suspects who fail to come up with the required confessions.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty denounced the Israeli government for applauding
the PA, its 'peace' partner, for detaining and torturing Palestinians on
the mere suspicion of association with the military wing of the Islamic
Resistance Movement (Hamas). </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;It is regrettable that the United States government
has played a major role in creating a serious rift within the Palestinian
community. This rift is likely to lead to the most dangerous inter-Palestinian
feud since the PA was created in Oslo in 1993&quot;, a statement by Liberty
said.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;Both Israel and the United States are held responsible
for having pressured the PA to act in order to prevent Hamas from responding
to what it insists has been an Israeli assassination of one of its leaders,
Mohyiddin Ash-Sharif. The PA has acquiesced by renouncing its initial position
of accusing Israel of being responsible for the murder. Instead, the PA
has devised an incredible scenario accusing Hamas itself of liquidating
one of its acclaimed heroes.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty condemned the Palestinian Authority for adopting
as an official policy the use of torture during interrogation. &quot;PA
security agents have repeatedly applied extremely painful physical and psychological
pressure on a number of Palestinian detainees in order to extract confessions
from them that they took part in the killing of the Hamas' military leader,&quot;
the human rights organization said. &quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty pointed out that several members of the Addassi
family, including women, have been severely persecuted in order to confess
to a crime they have consistently maintained their innocence from. The only
confession PA interrogators have been able to obtain is that of young Ghassan
Addassi, who now insists his confession was extracted from him under duress.
In a letter smuggled out of prison, Ghassan said:</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;I gave that testimony after having been subjected
to torture and threats I had never before seen in my life. They threatened
me with the charge of collaborating with the Israelis and that I took part
in the assassination of Mohyiddin on orders from the Israelis. I was beaten
considerably, I was denied sleep for three successive nights and I was hung
from my hands and suspended from the ceiling of the prison cell.&quot; </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty exposed the role of PA officials in faking accusations
against the Addassi family. &quot;Senior PA officials such as Jebril Ar-Rajoub,
head of security, and Tayyeb Abderrahim, spokesman for Yasser Arafat, took
part, personally, in the interrogation and punishment of detainees. According
to Ghassan Addassi, who now fears for his life, it was one of these two
officials&shy;Ar-Rajoub&shy;who threatened him that if he did not reiterate
his confession before some other PA officials who intended to visit him,
his sister&shy;whom they claimed was detained in a nearby cell&shy;would
be 'abused'. Fearing for the life and honour of his sister, Addassi repeated
his confession before Hatem Abdulqadir, member of the Palestinian Legislative
Council. When he told another visitor, Sheikh Mahmud Muslih, that his confessions
were false and that they were made under duress, the visitor himself was
arrested and imprisoned in order not to speak to the media or the public,&quot;
Liberty said.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty considered that the measures adopted so far by
the PA point in the direction of a conspiracy to conceal information and
most probably to vindicate Israel from the assassination of what it has
itself always described as its most-wanted enemy.  &quot;Several key witnesses
have been detained, and a number of Hamas officials who questioned the credibility
of the alleged PA investigation have been arrested and jailed. The media,
which sought to cover up the case, has not been spared either. The Reuters'
office in Gaza was shut down, and a number of journalists working for the
agency were arrested and forced to sign a declaration that they would refrain
from pursuing the matter further.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Liberty for the Muslim World called for immediate measures
in order to protect the Palestinians under occupation from &quot;a new plot
hatched against them by Israel and its allies in the Palestinian Authority,
which has&shy;very regrettably&shy;proven to be no more than another arm
of Israeli occupation,&quot; adding that it would not help the cause of
peace and stability in the region for the Palestinians to fight each other.
&quot;What is really needed is for Palestinian rights to be recognized and
for the rule of law to prevail instead of the rule of the growing PA Mafia,&quot;
Liberty concluded.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Arafat's police round up hundreds of Palestinians</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Following
the murder of Mohyiddin al Sharif on 29 March, Palestinian Authority police
detained as many as 200 Palestinian Islamist activists. The detainees included
prominent Islamist figures such as Dr. Abdul Aziz al Rantisi, Dr. Ibrahim
Makadmeh, as well as student leaders at the Islamic University in Gaza and
the Najah National University in Nablus.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, PA police arrested a number of the Khalas (Islamic
Salvation party) members for &quot;expressing non-conformist views incompatible
with the official line.&quot; The party's official weekly newspaper, al
Resala, said PA interrogators abused detained members in a variety of ways,
including &quot;beating, cursing, insulting and making threats.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The PA said the arrest of several Khalas members took place
after Khalas criticized the spate of arrests and administrative detentions
of Islamist elements by the PA police in the aftermath of Sharif's murder.
</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Islamist spokesman in Gaza said PA police raided homes
in Gaza, Khan Yunis and Rafah, usually after midnight, &quot;in ways very
similar to past Israeli practices.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amnesty International, the London-based human rights organization,
expressed anxiety over the illegal detention of Islamist activists at the
hands of PA police in possible coordination with Israel.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Amnesty International issued a statement in mid-April saying
several detainees were being tortured in PA interrogation and detention
centres.  The international human rights organization cited Abdul Aziz al
Rantisi as &quot;a prisoner of conscience.&quot; It pointed out that he
was being held incommunicado as he was prevented from coming in contact
with anybody.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The ostensible justification for placing Rantisi behind
bars lies in several statements he had made to the international media in
which he described as &quot;nonsense and silly&quot; the PA account of Mohyiddin
al Sharif's death.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Free At Last</FONT></H3>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Israeli occupation authorities finally released from
&quot;administrative detention&quot; Ahmed Katamesh, the longest-serving
Palestinian administrative detainee. Katamesh, a political activist associated
with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), spent 68
months in Israeli jails for reasons he still does not understand. The Israeli
occupation authorities refused repeatedly to free him or formally charge
him of any wrongdoing, arguing that he posed a danger to public safety and
to the security of the State and to the IDF. </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>&quot;They told me you will die a slow death here; they
wanted to break my will,&quot; said Katamesh on arrival home in Ramallah,
adding that &quot;my ordeal was in the normal order of the Zionist occupation
because justice and occupation are inherently incompatible.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Katamesh said in an interview with the Arabic daily al
Quds on 22 April that &quot;administrative detention was meant to inflict
emotional and psychological pain on Palestinians critical of the Israeli
occupation.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;They (the Zionists) act as criminal sadists who
enjoy seeing us suffer...this being the whole point behind incarcerating
us for so many months without charge or trial.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Katamesh castigated the Oslo accords, saying the accords
were &quot;an American-Israeli dictate on a weak Palestinian leadership.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Katamesh, 48, was released after Israeli Arab and Jewish
activists opposed to administrative detention launched a sustained campaign
to win his release.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another long-serving PFLP activist, Hasan Fatafta, was
also released with Katamesh. Fatafta spent 48 months in administrative detention.
Palestinian and human rights sources say there are as many as 300 Palestinian
administrative detainees languishing in Israeli prisons, not knowing why
they are being imprisoned or when they will be released.  </FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the Zionist authorities still detain as many
as 3,500 Palestinian prisoners as &quot;bargaining chips.&quot; The Oslo
accords and the subsequent Hebron Protocol stipulated their release, but
the Zionist authorities have so far refused to honour either agreement.</FONT></P>

Netanyahu announced on 23 April that negotiations were under way with Rahba'am
Zeivi, head of the ultra-racist Moledet party, for the purpose of including

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli government spokesman said the talks with Moledet
reached a decisive juncture, adding that &quot;the details remained to be
ironed out.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moledet, a Jewish Nazi-like party, calls for the expulsion
of all non-Jews from the West Bank, the Gaza Strip and Israel proper, the
Palestinian territories occupied by Jewish terrorist gangs in 1948.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A number of Likud and Labor party officials have criticized
the intention to include Moledet in the government.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Yossi Belen of the Labor Party described the move as a

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Even some of Netanyahu's allies objected to the imminent

liability rather than an asset.&quot;</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Palestinians Mark Prisoners Day</FONT></H3>

<P ALIGN=CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=+1>By Steve Sozby</FONT></B></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Annual Palestinian Prisoners Day in Palestine was on
18 April.  To mark the occasion, thousands of Palestinians in and out of
Israeli prisons marched, demonstrated and clashed with Israeli soldiers
throughout the West Bank and Gaza Strip. Over 3,000 Palestinian political
prisoners went on a one-day hunger strike to protest their continued detention
in Israeli jails. &quot;Today is Palestinian Prisoner's Day, and the detainees
in Israeli jails are marking it by going on a one-day hunger strike to protest
their continued arrest,&quot; said Hisham Abdel-Razek, the Palestinian Authority
(PA) official in charge of prisoners' affairs.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Meanwhile, on the streets of Palestine, thousands of people
carrying placards that read: &quot;There can be no peace until Prisoners
are released&quot;, and &quot;Prisoners are the heart of the Palestinian
Issue Now&quot; demonstrated in solidarity with the striking prisoners.
In East Jerusalem, Israeli troops broke up a march with tear gas and clubs,
injuring several civilians and arresting a half dozen more.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	A campaign is being mounted by various forces within the
territories to confront the continued detention of over 3,500 Palestinian
political prisoners in violation of the Oslo Accords.  According to Israeli
government figures, Israel continues to hold 3,648 Palestinian prisoners.
 Since the signing of the 1993 PLO-Israel peace deal, the Jewish State has
freed more than 7,544 Palestinians in partial fulfilment of signed accords.
 For years Palestinians have increased their demand that Israel fulfill
its signed obligations and release the rest of the prisoners.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Under interim peace deals signed between Israel and the
Palestinian Authority, Israel was supposed to free Palestinian prisoners
in three stages: after the 1995 West Bank deal was signed, before Palestinian
elections in early 1996, and during final status talks. The final status
talks are as far off today as they were when the accord was first signed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	&quot;There can be no peace without the release of thousands
of Palestinian in Israeli jails,&quot; said Um Jihad, the wife of the slain
Palestinian leader and the PA Minister of Social Affairs.  She led a demonstration
outside of the International Red Cross Committee on the eve of the visit
to Gaza by British Prime Minister Tony Blair, who was asked to intervene
with Israel to further the cause of Palestinian political prisoners by PA
leaders.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Palestinians are not the only people suffering inside
Israeli prisons.  On 20 April, an Israeli court extended for another six-month
period detention orders against 21 Lebanese prisoners held as &quot;bargaining
cards&quot; in negotiations over missing servicemen in Lebanon. These hostages
include Sheikh Abdel Karim Obeid, the Hizbollah cleric who was abducted
by IDF commandos in 1989, and Sheikh Mustafa Dirani, another Islamic leader
who was kidnapped from his home in Lebanon in 1994.  Under Israeli law,
so-called administration detention orders are subject to judicial review
every six months. &quot;Iran and other Middle Eastern countries are called
'terrorist States' and suffer international sanctions for suspicion of supporting
the taking of hostages,&quot; says Lebanese journalist George Karim in Beirut.
 &quot;Israel blatantly holds Lebanese nationals, who have not committed
any crime, as hostages and no one says anything.  It is this type of hypocrisy
that breeds so much anger in the Arab world.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	On 15 April, the longest held administrative detainee,
Ahmed Katamesh, was released after spending more than five years in an Israeli
prison without charge. Katamesh, a journalist suspected of being a member
of the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine (PFLP), expressed mixed
feelings at his home in the West Bank town of el-Bireh following his release.
 &quot;I am torn between happiness at being home with my family... and the
painful memory of the death of my mother, father and brother--I have just
come from the cemetery--and my anger at the policy of administrative detention.''</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Israel is not the only country holding people without
charge or trial in prison. The PA continues to hold 31 suspected Hamas activists
without charge following the alleged inter-Hamas killing of Mohyiddin Sharif
in Ramallah earlier in April.   Dozens of other Palestinians remain in PA
prisons without trial or charge for opposition to the Oslo Accords.   In
a move that reflects Israeli measures in the West Bank during the intifadah,
the PA closed the Reuters Gaza office on 9 April for &quot;distributing
false news&quot; related to the assassination of Sharif.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	While both Israeli and PA officials employ arbitrary measures
to deal with opposition, a growing movement on the streets of Palestine
is confronting the issue of political prisoners through an international
campaign.  On 15 April, a Middle East prisoners aid group began collecting
signatures of 1 million people in and outside of Palestine, urging Israel
to release the remaining 3,500 political prisoners. Dr. Haider Abdel Shafi,
a former member of the Palestinian Legislative Council, was the first to
sign the petition, which was organized by the Palestinian Society to Defend
Prisoners in Israel.  &quot;This campaign aims to approve the legitimacy
of our cause, and to tell Israel that in the era of peace, there must not
be one single Palestinian prisoner in its jails,&quot; said Hisham Abdel
Razek, a PA official and the head of the Society, who spent 19 years in
Israeli prisons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>	Political prisoners in Israeli and PA jails continue to
be a rallying cause for a grass-roots movement on the streets of Palestinian
towns, camps and villages.  The longer the Netanyahu government continues
to hold thousands of prisoners in violation of the Oslo Accords, the greater
the movement will grow to demonstrate and confront Israeli forces throughout
the region.  This will certainly lead to further bloodshed and violence
in the immediate future.</FONT></P>

1997</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (25 April)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
The Israeli occupation authorities destroyed in 1997 as many as 170 Palestinian
homes throughout the West Bank as part of punitive measures against the
Palestinian population.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>A report published on 24 April by the Jerusalem-based Legal
Centre for the Protection of Land said most of the demolished homes were
located in area &quot;C&quot;, where the Israeli army maintains complete
control.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Some of the destroyed homes, however, were in area &quot;B&quot;,
where Yasser Arafat's Palestinian Authority is supposed to exercise &quot;civilian
control&quot;.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The demolition of three homes late last year (in full view
of Palestinian policemen) at Asira al Shamaliya, which is under PA civilian
control, is a pertinent example.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The report also pointed out that the Israeli government
had transferred large sums of money to the settlements for expansion.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Moreover, the report put the number of Jewish settlers
throughout the West Bank and the Gaza Strip at 161,000, of which 155,000
are in the West Bank and the rest in the Gaza Strip.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Finally, the report pointed out that the Israeli government
was about to transfer	 3,500 Ethiopian immigrants to West Bank settlements.</FONT></P>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem-</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1> A Palestinian
villager was seriously injured and a Jewish settler was killed on 23 April
in a shoot-out that took place outside a Jewish settlement southwest of
Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Palestinian sources, the incident occurred
when three Jewish settlers opened fire at a group of Palestinian peasants,
apparently in an attempt to drive them away and seize their land.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The peasants reportedly resisted the three settlers, described
as &quot;trigger-happy,&quot; and seized their weapons.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>In the ensuing quarrel, one settler was killed and two
others sustained gun wounds.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Palestinian sources said it was highly likely that the
settler was killed by bullets mistakenly fired by fellow settlers.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>One Palestinian was critically injured and died later in
hospital.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>An Israeli government spokesman claimed the incident was
&quot;a terrorist attack.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>However, eyewitnesses denied this, contending that the
settlers started the shooting.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1> &quot;They have been harassing us for many years, and
their aim is to intimidate us into leaving our land so that they can build
more Jewish settlements thereon,&quot; said Musa Makhamreh of the village
of Yatta, whose cousin Muhammed was badly injured in the shoot-out.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Another Palestinian, Mahmud Dababseh, also of Yatta, argued
that the settler killed in the incident had previously provoked Palestinian
peasants with sinister acts, including shooting at their livestock, burning
their fields and spreading poisonous substances on the grass on which their
herds graze.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>On 23 April, the PA allowed Israeli Shabak interrogators
to question the Palestinian shepherd at his hospital bed in Hebron.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Meanwhile, the Israeli army carried out a spate of arrests
in Yatta, which is supposed to be &quot;a liberated Palestinian area.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Local sources said as many as 30 villagers were arrested
during nightly raids on villagers' homes in Yatta between 20 and 23 April.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>Hamas wins big in student elections at major
Palestinian universities</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem (25 April)</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>
The Islamic Bloc (al Kutla al Islamiy-ya) has accomplished a series of successes
recently by winning the &quot;lion's share&quot; of students' votes at major
Palestinian universities in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip. The Bloc,
which is loosely affiliated with Hamas, won the biggest share of votes at
al Najah National University in Nablus, the Hebron University, the Beir
Zeit University, the Islamic University in Gaza, the Al Quds (Jerusalem)
and the Polytechnic University in Hebron, as well as in other student elections
at several other smaller colleges in the West Bank.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The Islamic Bloc actually was able to dislodge PLO supporters
from some of their strongholds such as that at the Najah University, where
the pro-Fatah Shabiba dominated the student council for eight consecutive
years prior to the Oslo Accords and the establishment of the Palestinian
Authority.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>The successes of the Islamist camp in student elections
at Palestinian institutions of higher education has been studied and analyzed.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>According to Professor Omar Abdul Razzak, professor of
Economics at the Najah National University, the Islamist successes were
made possible thanks to the free college environment whereby Islamist activists
could speak out freely and convincingly, challenging and refuting some of
the long-established views on a variety of subjects.</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Razzak said the repeated encroachment on academic
freedoms by PA security agents (such as raiding college campuses and student
dorms) shifted sympathies in favour of the Islamists, as many students felt
indignant at the uncivilized behaviour by an authority that claims to be
a &quot;liberator of the people&quot; but one which is acting as &quot;tormentor
of the people.&quot;</FONT></P>

<P><FONT SIZE=+1>Abdul Razzak added that Islamist successes in Palestine
should be viewed in the context of the overall Islamic revival the world
over. This assessment is shared by Munzer Mashaki, a noted leader of the
Islamic bloc at the Najah University. He says the popularity of the Islamic
bloc was only a reflection of the overall Islamic revival, adding, however,
that the &quot;Islamic Choice&quot; has always been popular among the more
educated segments of society.</FONT></P>

in France may be standing behind these threats against Garaudy, known for
his hostility towards Zionism. The Zionist organizations had launched a
campaign against him and proceeded against him before a criminal court because
of his book, &quot;The Founding Myths of Israeli Politics&quot;.</FONT></P>

<H3 ALIGN=CENTER><FONT SIZE=+2>arrest of 20 Lebanese detainees</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Occupied Jerusalem</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- An Israeli
court renewed the administrative detention of 22 Lebanese prisoners detained
in Israeli jails for an additional six-month period, in a move to hold them
as hostages until the return of Israeli captives and lost soldiers in Lebanon,
according to Israeli official statements.  Israeli papers said that Tel
Aviv Central Court approved after eight hours of debate the Israeli Attorney
General's request to keep the Lebanese detainees, including Sheikh Abdel
Karim Ubaid and Mustafa Dirani, two leaders of the Lebanese Hizbollah Group,
for another six-month period. The Court, for the first time, permitted the
Israeli media to write that the detention of these Lebanese prisoners in
Israeli jails without trial is being used as a bargaining card by the Israeli
government in an effort to restore the Israeli pilot Ron Arad and some other
Israeli soldiers believed to be lost during the Israeli attacks on Lebanon.</FONT></P>

General to play his official and legal role and duty in supervising the
arrests made by the PA security bodies against the political opposers. The
Commission called for bringing any Palestinian before a civil court if there
are sufficient charges against him and for trying them publicly. A statement
by the Commission called on the Attorney General to allow detainees to meet
with their lawyers and to permit the Commission's representatives to visit
them. The statement urged the PA's relevant authorities to observe the legal
procedures of detention and not to resort to random arrests that were made
on the basis of political affiliation following the assassination of Hamas
military leader Muhyideen al Sharif. The Commission expressed its concern
over these arrests and the inspection of houses, which made for a tense
situation on the Palestinian Street.</FONT></P>

their students' right of education</FONT></H3>

<P><B><FONT SIZE=+1>Nablus</FONT></B><FONT SIZE=+1>- Al Najah National University
in Nablus, north of the West Bank, last month organized a rally to express
solidarity with students who cannot reach their universities because of
obstacles imposed by the occupation authorities. The rally mainly meant
to support about 1,200 Gazan students who study in the West Bank universities
because of being prevented by the Israeli soldiers to cross Israeli checkpoints
on their way to their universities in the West Bank. Most of these students
take a longer time to graduate than the students from the West Bank because
of the Israeli arbitrary measures. Speakers at the rally urged the Palestinian
Authority and the international human rights organization to exert efforts
in order to facilitate crossing Israeli checkpoints by the Gazan students.
One of the Gazan students said more than 20 Gazans studying in the West
Bank could not go back to Gaza to bury their dead parents or relatives because
they were afraid of not being allowed to return to their universities in
the West Bank.</FONT></P>
