    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel has an unprecedented opportunity to withdraw from the Golan Heights
    and make peace with Syria because Syria lacks a genuine military option, according to a
    study on the military balance in the Middle East published yesterday by the Jaffee Centre
    for Strategic Studies, an Israeli think-tank. Israel and Syria resumed peace talks last
    week. But many Israelis oppose complete withdrawal from the Golan Heights, which Israel
    captured in June 1967.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The authors argue that Israel can take calculated risks in holding peace
    negotiations with Syria since the ability of President Hafez al-Assad's army to launch an
    overland attack on Israel has greatly weakened.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">For nearly two decades, the South Lebanon Army fought as Israel's ally and
    then proxy against Islamic guerrillas in Lebanon. But yesterday, members of the militia
    petitioned the Israeli Supreme Court for asylum, saying their lives will be in danger if
    Israel withdraws from Lebanon as part of a peace treaty with Syria.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak has already promised to remove his army
    from a self-declared security zone in southern Lebanon by July, and any deal with Syria,
    the power broker in Lebanon, is almost certain to include a pullback.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">''Every thinking person knows that the possibility of concluding the
    Lebanese tragedy is connected with the talks with Syria,'' Barak said in Jerusalem upon
    his return from Washington.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">A senior emissary of Israeli Prime Minister Ehud Barak met with a senior
    White House official last week to lobby the Clinton administration for a pardon for
    convicted spy Jonathan Jay Pollard, U.S. officials said.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Pollard's case is the subject of a nearly completed high-level review that
    President Clinton promised Barak's predecessor, Binyamin Netanyahu, at the Wye River peace
    talks more than a year ago.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Government agencies, including the Justice Department and the CIA, have
    recommended against a pardon, but Clinton has not made a decision.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Ehud Barak, Israeli prime minister, is expanding Jewish settlements in the
    West Bank at a much faster rate than his predecessor, Benjamin Netanyahu, peace groups
    said yesterday. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The claim by Peace Now, the leftwing Israeli peace movement, was made
    after the housing ministry issued tenders to build 500 homes in two Jewish settlements in
    the West Bank. The ministry is run by the National Religious party which supports the
    settlers.</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Among the principles that distinguish the American system from
    make-believe democracies, none is more indispensable than the right of an accused
    individual to face his accusers in court and compel them to test their evidence against
    his in an open and timely adversarial procedure. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">In two recent cases that illuminate the danger of abridging this right
    under any circumstances, the Immigration and Naturalization Service has sought to use a
    provision of an antiterrorism law to incarcerate and deport immigrants on the basis of
    secret evidence. In late October Hany Kiareldeen, a Palestinian who came under suspicion
    because he met with one of the men convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing, was
    released after 19 months in custody when a federal judge ruled that it is unconstitutional
    to detain an immigrant on the basis of secret evidence.</p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Judge William H. Walls said the government had tried to compel Kiareldeen
    to answer ''anonymous slurs of unseen and unsworn informers, '' and these tactics ''raised
    serious issues about the integrity of the adversarial process.''</p>

    <p ALIGN="LEFT">Outrage and division over Yasser Arafat's crackdown on a group of
    prominent Palestinians who signed a leaflet which - for the first time - publicly blamed
    him for &quot;opening the door&quot; to corruption, has escalated sharply after one of the
    signatories was shot. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">..The attack came amid a growing furore within the ranks of leading
    Palestinians which began when 11 people were detained without charge on the orders of Mr
    Arafat for signing a highly critical leaflet. Three were later released. </p>
    <p ALIGN="LEFT">The document, which bore the names of 20 prominent people - 11 academics
    and professionals and nine law-makers - accused Mr Arafat of opening the door to
    widespread corruption. There have long been allegations that hundreds of millions of
    dollars have gone unaccounted for within the Palestinian Authority, but this was the first
    direct charge against the Palestinian leader.</p>
