<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Albright fails to bridge gaps between Israel and
PA</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem</b> <b>&#150; From Khaled Amayreh</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In her thirty-third visit to Palestine on 28 June, U.S. Secretary of State
Madeline Albright failed again to bridge the wide gaps between Israel and the Palestinian
Authority on the paramount final status issues such as the fate of Jerusalem, the refugees
and the borders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright met separately with Israeli and Palestinian officials on 28 June
but without making any breakthroughs.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Following her first meeting with Barak, the Israeli Prime Minister
reiterated his refusal to pull out of the West Bank. &#147;We will not return to the
borders of 1967; the Palestinians want 100% of the territory, and this is unacceptable to
us.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Ramallah, Albright urged PA Chairman Yasser Arafat to &#147;make
sacrifices for peace,&#148; which observers surmise as a tacit pressure on the Palestinian
leader for further concessions to the Zionist regime.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, Arafat this time refused to budge.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;They carried out UN resolutions 242 on the Egyptian and Jordanian
fronts, and there is a similar agreement on the Syrian front; they carried out UN
resolution 425 on the Lebanese front, and we demand they do the same on the Palestinian
front,&#148; said Arafat following his meeting with Albright.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The main thrust of Albright&#146;s visit to Palestine was to weigh the
prospects of holding a make-or-break U.S.-Israeli-PA marathon summit to hammer out a
framework agreement on final status issues, a penultimate step before the signing of a
peace treaty between Israel and the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it was apparent from the beginning that the gaps separating the
two sides on such fundamental issues as Jerusalem, the refugees and future borders between
Israel and a prospective Palestinian State were too wide to be bridged.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even before Albright&#146;s arrival in Palestine, U.S. Envoy Dennis Ross,
who has been shuttling between West Jerusalem and Ramallah in an effort to narrow these
gaps, admitted on Tuesday that the two sides were still far apart and that the gaps
&#147;were still very wide.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Earlier, Israel appeared to be pushing hard for a summit in Washington
ostensibly in the hope that the U.S. would wrest further concessions from Chairman Arafat,
given President Clinton&#146;s diminishing ability to pressure Israel as a result of
domestic American considerations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian leadership, nonetheless, has thus far remained opposed to
holding such a summit, especially in the absence of real progress on the outstanding
fundamental issues.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Summits are held when most issues are threshed out and when only
small differences need to be ironed out by the leaders. In our case, there are still very
wide gaps separating the two sides and these need to be bridged before a summit can be
held,&#148; said PA negotiator Ahmed Qrei.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, PA presidential spokesman Nabil Abu Rudaineh questioned Israeli
motives behind the aggressive pushing for a summit meeting in Washington.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;The Israelis want the summit in order to pressure the Palestinian
leadership into making concessions and signing an agreement. We know their game&#150;each
time they don&#146;t get anywhere with our negotiators, they try to deal directly with
Chairman Arafat.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians insist that Israel carry out the outstanding issues of
the interim agreement, including the paramount third phase of redeployment and the release
of Palestinian prisoners.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel refuses to do so, insisting on merging the implementation of the
remaining interim issues with the final settlement. The reason is to keep the PA in an
inferior negotiating position <i>vis-à-vis</i> Israel and to minimize Israeli
&#147;concessions&#148; to the Palestinians in the context of the final settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinians are aware of Israeli tactics to that effect.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian negotiator Sa&#146;eb Ureikat scolded &#147;these Israeli
manouevres, which will go nowhere.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Israel must realize that without full Israeli withdrawal to the 4
June 1967 borders in fulfillment of UN resolutions 242 and 338 as well as the resolution
of the refugees&#146; cause in accordance with UN resolution 194, there can be no
agreement and there can be no settlement.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clearly, the Israeli government rejects this Palestinian position and
refuses to recognize the said UN resolutions as the basis for a final settlement of the
conflict. Instead, it seeks aggressively to cajole the Palestinian Authority into agreeing
to a &#147;compromise&#148; whereby the Jewish State would retain control of Jerusalem and
large chunks of the West Bank while the PA would effectively cede the Palestinian
refugees&#146; right to return to their former towns and villages from which they were
expelled when Israel was created in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, a deal as such would be rejected outright by the
Palestinian people. In fact, Arafat himself reportedly intimated to President Clinton that
should he sign a peace agreement excluding Jerusalem, his own life would be in danger.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Barak, having labouriously succeeded in patching up his
government following the recent crisis with the ultra-orthodox Shas movement, found
temporary solace when the Knesset voted on Tuesday, 27 June, to rescind a bill that would
have dissolved the Knesset and led to early general elections in Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Nevertheless, new coalition rifts were looming again, underscoring the
fragility of Barak&#146;s government and its inability to take tough decisions on the
peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Shas itself, and despite the excessive concessions it extracted from Barak
as a price for staying in the government, has again threatened to quit the coalition if
the transfer of promised funds to its corrupt-ridden school system is not made
immediately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Israeli Interior Minister Natan Sharansky also threatened to
quit the government in case Barak decides to attend a Washington summit with Arafat
without illustrating Israel&#146;s red lines beforehand.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Based on what I heard today, if a decision is made to hold a summit
and the Prime Minister goes (to the summit), I will leave the government,&#148; Sharansky
reportedly said at a meeting of the Yisrael Ba&#146;liya bureau Tuesday evening.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Foreign Minister David Levy indicated that his alliance with Barak
could be terminated if the Israeli premier offered the Palestinians &#147;far-reaching
concessions.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We have offered the maximum without getting even the minimum from
the Palestinians. The question is &#145;has Arafat understood the need to make
concessions?&#146; I don&#146;t think so, and I am doubtful there will be a summit,&#148;
said Levy during an Israeli television show Tuesday night.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Albright&#146;s visit was preceded by a plethora of hard-line, even
vitriolic statements from both sides.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Responding to statements made a couple of weeks earlier by Israeli chief
of staff General Shaul Mofaz in which the Israeli general threatened to use tanks and
helicopter gunships to quell possible Palestinian protests in case the peace process
collapsed, Arafat retorted saying, &#147;We will not be scared by these threats. I remind
those who forget of the Karama battle, Beirut and the intifadah.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Several officials from both sides joined the verbal duel, which
underscored the potential volatility of Israeli-Palestinian relations, with Levy vowing to
&#147;defend Israel&#146;s red lines,&#148; and PA official Ahmed Abdul Rahman urging
Jewish settlers to &#147;leave our land with your bulldozers because this is what you will
have to do sooner or later.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas, too, stepped into the fray, vowing to &#147;set Israel ablaze if
the Israeli army attacked our people.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The war of words, needless to say, underscores the volatility of
Palestinian-Israeli relations and the potential for an outbreak of violence in case a
breakthrough is not reached.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And with the ostensible American failure to get Israel to abide by UN
resolutions pertaining to the Palestinian question, and with the Palestinian leadership
seemingly determined to declare Palestinian Statehood in September&#150;unilaterally or
otherwise&#150;it would be quite safe to presume that the region&#146;s summer will be
very hot, indeed.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA continues onslaught of free media</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ramallah (West Bank)- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In an effort to stifle further criticisms against secret talks with
Israel, the Palestinian Authority has stepped up its campaign against independent and
non-conformist media in the West Bank.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The latest measures included the closure of several radio and television
stations in the West Bank as well as the arrest of a number of Palestinian journalists for
&#147;incitement and speaking ill of the Palestinian leadership&#148; and also &#147;for
endangering Palestinian national interests.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The clamp-down mainly targeted the media outlets that &#147;didn&#146;t go
with the flow&#148; and that refused to practice the crippling self-censorship which has
virtually completely emasculated the Palestinian press and made it innocuous at best.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The new spate of suppression started on 21 May when agents from the
Criminal Investigation Department (CID), one of Yasser Arafat&#146;s estimated 13 security
agencies, ordered Omar Nazzal, director of the Ramallah-based private television station
(al-Watan), to cease broadcasting immediately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA gave no reasons for the closure, but the proprietor suggested it
had to do with comments voiced by a viewer during a phone-in show in which the viewer
scoffed at remarks made earlier by PA Chairman Yasser Arafat discounting the victory of
Hizbullah in South Lebanon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat had said in an interview with Israeli channel 2 television that the
Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon was prompted by Israel&#146;s desire to carry out
United Nations resolution 425 and had nothing to do with Hizbullah resistance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The remarks infuriated most Palestinians who used words such as
&#147;stupid&#148; and &#147;sycophantic&#148; to describe them, prompting the
PA-controlled media to reassert Palestinian solidarity with &#147;the Lebanese national
resistance.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 May, as it was clear that no laws were violated, the PA Ministry of
Information allowed Nazzal to resume broadcasting. However, when he did, CID agents
stormed al-Watan&#146;s studio in downtown Ramallah, ordering all employees to leave the
building or else they would be arrested.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">When Nazzal sought to tell the heavily armed force that the Ministry of
Information had given him permission to broadcast, the police simply replied that they did
not recognize the Ministry&#146;s authority.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The station was eventually allowed to reopen on 24 May, apparently after
Marwan al-Barghouthi, head of Fatah&#146;s Supreme Council in the West Bank, interceded
with some influential PA officials on Nazzal&#146;s behalf.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The closure of al-Watan marked the fifth of its kind since it began
broadcasting in 1996.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The clamp-down continued on 30 May when the same CID agents raided the
studios and offices of the private television station al-Nasser and its sister radio
station, al-Manara in Ramallah, again for allowing criticisms of the secret talks between
Israel and the PA in Stockholm.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The criticisms were reportedly made during a talk show when a Palestinian
Legislative Council member suggested that a new Palestinian leadership might be necessary
for the attainment of Palestinian rights and avoiding a sell-out of these rights to Israel
by the current Palestinian leadership, a prospective that is increasingly dreaded by many
Palestinians, intellectuals and commoners alike.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;This is a grave violation of basic press freedom; they (the PA) are
trying to replicate Arab dictatorships here by fostering an atmosphere of fear and terror
whereby the citizens refrain from criticizing the government,&#148; said al-Nasser&#146;s
director, Ammar Ammar, in reaction to the closure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The closure of al-Nasser was widely criticized by democratic-minded groups
and human rights organizations as well as by many Palestinian journalists.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the PA seemed utterly unmoved by these criticisms.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This was demonstrated on 1 June, when CDI agents closed down the al-Mahed
television station in Bethlehem and arrested its owner, Samir Qumsiyeh.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Qumsiyeh, who is also the director of the Union of Private TV and Radio
Station owners, had earlier circulated a memo asking member stations to replace their
regular programmes for half an hour with a message protesting PA suppression of the press.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The arrest of Qumsiyeh and the closure of his television outlet carried
the following message to the Palestinian public, namely that not only critics of Arafat
and his policies will be suppressed, but also anybody else protesting this suppression,
whoever he might be.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">PA police had earlier arrested Fathi Barqawi, Chief News Editor at the
Voice of Palestine, the official PA radio station, for &#147;incitement and speaking ill
of the Palestinian leadership.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Barqawi was arrested in his hometown of Tulkarm reportedly after voicing
criticisms of the Stockholm talks and alluding that Arafat was about to embark on making
&#147;deep concessions&#148; to Israel on paramount issues such as the future of Jerusalem
and the fate of some 4 million Palestinian refugees expelled from their homes when Israel
was created in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 6 June, as many as ten Palestinian political organizations, including
Fatah and Hamas, circulated a leaflet in the West Bank criticizing &#147;transgressions
against press freedom in violation of the law.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The leaflet urged the Palestinian leadership to rescind all measures
against media outlets and demanded that the security agencies be reined-in in order to
facilitate the establishment of civil society in Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 17 June, hundreds of Palestinians from various political factions,
including Hamas, marched through the streets of Ramallah to protest the continued
onslaught on the media and political dissent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The marchers carried placards reading &#147;We didn&#146;t struggle for a
police state&#148; and &#147;Where is the rule of law?&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the protesters demanded the immediate release of all political
prisoners who are being detained without charge or trial in PA jails for criticizing the
Palestinian leadership and the behaviour of its numerous security agencies.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Suppression of media seen as forewarning</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, many Palestinians seem now convinced that the latest spate of
suppression against the non-conformist media is merely a pre-warning to the Palestinian
people at large by Arafat that any active opposition to a prospective unpopular deal with
Israel will be crushed mercilessly by security agencies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">But this is not the end of the story.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For if a scenario as such came about, the PA security agencies would not
be up against just the traditional opposition groups such as the Islamic movements and
some still-defiant leftist factions, but would have also to face many followers of Fatah
who would view a deal as such as an outright treason and betrayal of the Palestinian
national struggle.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And as the recent unrest in the occupied territories demonstrated, Arafat
can take nothing for granted, including Fatah&#146;s unconditional loyalty.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Palestinians ambivalent about Assad&#146;s death</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem- Special to PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Most Palestinians reacted with marked ambivalence and apathy to the death
on 10 June of Syrian President Hafez al Assad at age 70.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the official level, PA President Yasser Arafat, who is also 70 years
old, issued a terse statement, eulogizing the Syrian leader and offering &#147;our deep
condolences to the Syrian people and the Arab nation.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, Arafat declared a token three-day period of mourning throughout
the autonomous enclaves, and the PA official radio station, the Voice of Palestine,
broadcast recitations from the Holy Qur&#146;an.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat did attend Assad&#146;s funeral, reportedly after Egyptian
President Husni Mubarak interceded with the Syrians to allow Arafat to go to Damascus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, the clearly lukewarm reception that Arafat found upon his arrival
suggested that the Syrians are not going to change their mind about Arafat anytime soon.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assad looked down on Arafat with disdain and even contempt. He never
wasted a chance to scold the Palestiniann leader for his &#147;capitulatory
agreements&#148; with Israel, often arguing that Israel&#146;s humiliating treatment of
the PA vindicated his own uncompromising stance on the Golan Heights as well as his
stubborn rejection of Oslo-styled deals with Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat had been trying hard to patch relations with Assad but to no avail.
His self-humiliating sycophantic approach to Damascus as well as his numerous emissaries
failed to get &#147;the Lion of Damascus&#148; to relent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, the Syrian-PA relations deteriorated considerably in the few
months preceding Assad&#146;s death.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A few months ago, Syrian Defense Minister Mustafa Tlass publicly scolded
Arafat for &#147;selling-out Jerusalem to the Zionists,&#148; calling him the &#147;son of
60,000 bitches.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, it is unlikely that Arafat&#146;s participation in Assad&#146;s
funeral will result in an early thaw in Syrian-PA relations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The would-be Syrian leader, Bashar, will be busy for months to come
consolidating his power base and dealing with other more pressing priorities, and
relations with Arafat are unlikely to become a real preoccupation for the new Assad of
Damascus.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">At the popular level, most ordinary Palestinians did not seem to be
greatly saddened by Assad&#146;s death.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;He will face the people he had killed in Hama and Lebanon,&#148;
said a Hebron taxi driver, alluding to the thousands of Syrian Islamists and their
relatives crushed by the Syrian army in the city of Hama in 1982 following a brief
rebellion.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Of course, we are not really mourning after all that Assad did to
the Palestinians,&#148; a Fatah activist remarked.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In fact, most ordinary Palestinians felt that no tears ought to be shed
for leaders such as Assad, who came to symbolize brutal despotism in the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Still, other Palestinians were amazed by the speed in which Assad&#146;s
son, Bashar, was being groomed to succeed his father.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A columnist who writes regularly for the semi-official daily <i>Al-Ayyam </i>remarked
on 11 June that &#147;the kingdom-republic of Syria will have a new King-President.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Aside from that, however, many Palestinians seemed to harbour certain
hopes that the new leadership in Damascus will make drastic reforms, particularly in the
field of upholding civil liberties and human rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Such hopes, which are not unrealistic given Bashar&#146;s ongoing campaign
against corruption, might be justified to a certain degree given that any democratic
inroads in any Arab country would eventually spread to the rest of the Arab world, sooner
or later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinians also seemed to hope that the new Assad of Damascus (Assad
means lion) will insist on recovering in full the Syrian Golan Heights, seized by Israel
in 1967, when his father was then Defense Minister.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The logic here is that if Syria insisted on recovering all its
territories, in accordance with United Nations resolution 242, and Israel complied, the
Palestinians would be in a stronger position to demand parity with Syria, namely full
Israeli withdrawal from the West Bank and Gaza Strip pursuant to the same resolution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, Assad&#146;s uncompromising stance <i>vis-à-vis</i> the Golan,
and his persistent resistance to Israel&#146;s dictates are among the few things of
Assad&#146;s legacy that most Palestinians now remember with admiration, especially when
put in contrast with Yasser Arafat&#146;s often obsequious approach <i>vis-à-vis</i>
Israel.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas expresses sorrow</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas has expressed profound sorrow at the death of Syrian President Hafez
al Assad.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The movement&#146;s leadership issued a statement today, offering
condolences to Assad&#146;s son, Bashar, his family, the Syrian people and the Arab
nation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement said Hamas was shocked by the news of Assad&#146;s death,
calling the deceased Syrian leader &#147;a great Arab leader.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The statement also highlighted Assad&#146;s &#147;unceasing support for
the Palestinian cause and solid determination to recover the entirety of the Golan
Heights.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;On this occasion, we remember the deceased&#146;s enduring
steadfastness in the face of Zionist and American pressure, as well as his support for the
Islamic resistance in southern Lebanon which was instrumental in enabling the Lebanese
people to liberate their land.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas maintains an office in Damascus, and one of its top officials, Musa
Abu Marzuq, resides also in the Syrian capital, having been deported from Jordan.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">PA escalates rhetoric</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza- PT</b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Given the peace process with Israel facing a virtual deadlock, if not a
dead end, Palestinian Authority officials have been seeking to galvanize the public mood
in the West Bank and Gaza Strip in advance of the seemingly likely declaration of
Palestinian Statehood on 13 September.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 25 June, while addressing thousands of his Fatah supporters in the town
of Nablus, Palestinian Authority President Yasser Arafat declared that the &#147;next few
weeks are going to be the most sensitive and crucial for the Palestinian people because we
will declare our Palestinian State with Jerusalem as its capital and whoever doesn&#146;t
like it, let him drink from the Dead Sea.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat added, amid a crescendo of applause, that &#147;our people will not
be scared&#150;not by tanks, not by aircrafts&#150;and we remind those who doubt our
resolve of the battle of al-Karama and the intifadah.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat&#146;s remarks were in response to recent statements by the Israeli
Chief of Staff, Shaul Mofaz, in which he&#150;the Israeli general&#150;warned that the
Israeli army would use tanks and helicopter gun ships to quell possible Palestinian
protests in case the peace process collapsed.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, it is also believed that the verbal escalation on Arafat&#146;s
part, which coincided with the arrival of U.S. Secretary of State Madeleine Albright in
Palestine-Israel on 27 June, is aimed mainly at enhancing the PA negotiating position by
demonstrating to the Israelis, and the Americans as well, that the PA has other options
and that Arafat couldn&#146;t sign a dismal final agreement with Israel that would betray
Palestinian aspirations and rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">However, this tactic of arousing the masses&#146; expectations could be
somewhat risky for Arafat, especially if he decides at one point that he would accept less
than a 100% Israeli withdrawal from the territories Israel seized in 1967 and only a
symbolic implementation of the refugees&#146; right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Actually, there are many signs that he would accept a compromise, though
he insists that it be as favourable to him as possible.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his Nablus speech, the Palestinian leader made a passing but
significant remark which his aroused audience apparently failed to comprehend its real
significance. Arafat said he would not accept the Israeli offer of receiving &#147;just
75% of the West Bank,&#148; which suggested that he might, even would, accept a compromise
somewhere between 75% and 100%.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, a compromise as such, which would also exclude Jerusalem
and the right of return, would be utterly rejected by the bulk of the Palestinian
nationalist camp, e.g. Fatah, in addition, of course, to the Islamist and leftist camps.
And it would be difficult for Arafat to contain this rejection and keep it in the verbal
sphere.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even Arafat himself, who appealed to the Americans not to pressure him
further into making additional concessions to Israel, reportedly intimated to President
Clinton during his last visit to Washington that his life would be in danger if he crossed
the Palestinian national red lines.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If true, this suggests that Arafat may be willing eventually to
accommodate at least some of the Israeli demands, particularly on the refugee issue, but
that he is worried about a strong, unfavourable popular reaction from people that could
corrode his leadership.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last week, Arafat ordered his police to arrest his own advisor on
refugees, Abdul Fattah Ghanem, upon his return from Amman.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Ghanem reportedly leaked to Palestinian opposition groups information
suggesting that the Palestinian leadership was coming to terms with Israel&#146;s
rejectionist stance on the refugees&#146; right of return.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Last month, Arafat&#146;s security chief in Gaza, Muhammed Dahlan told a
prominent refugee committee in Gaza that the refugee cause was no longer a problem since
most of them didn&#146;t want to return to their homes in what is now Israel.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat later distanced himself from these statements by merely saying that
&#147;the Palestinian position on the refugees remains unchanged.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">All in all, the conflicting signals Arafat is giving to the masses
publicly, and the Israelis and the Americans privately, underscores the dilemma he is
facing, namely the fact that the requirements of the &#147;peace process&#148; as
understood by the Americans and the Israelis are incompatible, even irreconcilable, with
the most basic Palestinian aspirations.</p>
<u><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas warns Israel and U.S.</b></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Meanwhile, Hamas has warned Israel and the United States against imposing
any kind of agreement on the Palestinians which fails to fulfill their legitimate rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hamas founder and leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin told reporters in Gaza on 26
June that the Palestinian people would reject any such agreement even if Yasser Arafat put
his signature to it.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Responding to Israeli threats to repress further Palestinian protests,
Yassin said, &#147;We will set Israel ablaze if the Israeli army attacks
Palestinians.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin argued that Israel&#146;s rejection of Palestinian rights and
insistence on ignoring the refugees&#146; right of return and retaining occupied East
Jerusalem vindicated Hamas&#146; opposition to the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that &#147;the only language Israel understands is the language
of force.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, Yassin tacitly warned Arafat against giving in to
Israeli and American pressure, saying the issue of Jerusalem was an Islamic cause and that
the Palestinian leadership had no right to make compromises on the fate of the town.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Interestingly, Hamas of late has collaborated with Fatah and some leftist
groups in urging the PA to release political prisoners who are interned without charge or
trial, often for criticizing PA political despotism and corruption.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This cooperation yielded positive results last week when Arafat ordered
the release of Omar Assaf, a teacher unionist affiliated with the Democratic Front for the
Liberation of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Assaf was arrested nearly two months ago for accusing the PA of embezzling
funds which the donor countries had allocated for the teachers.</p>

accept a capitulatory agreement</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza -</b> Hamas founder and spiritual leader Sheikh Ahmed Yassin warned
Israel and the United States against imposing a &#147;capitulatory agreement&#148; on the
Palestinian people, saying Palestinians will not accept any agreement that would fail to
meet their aspirations and just demands.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin, who was speaking to reporters in Gaza on Monday, 26 June, said
while the U.S. and the Zionist regimes might succeed in cajoling PA Chairman Yasser Arafat
into accepting such an agreement, the Palestinian people would reject it out of hand and
consider it null and void.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yassin said Jerusalem was not a Palestinian or an Arab issue, but an
Islamic issue since the holy Islamic places are located there. He argued that no Arab or
Islamic leader had the right to cede Muslim rights to Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Even all the Palestinians and all the Arabs don&#146;t own the right
to give up Jerusalem, the third holiest Islamic place in the world.&#148; Yassin pointed
out that Israel&#146;s rejection of Palestinian rights vindicated Hamas&#146; opposition
to the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He said that only a peace based on justice can survive, adding that Israel
will not remain strong forever and Muslims won&#146;t remain weak forever. He pointed out
that &#147;we don&#146;t fight Jews for being Jews, but rather because they happen to be
our oppressor.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;I would fight my own brother if he took over my home,&#148; he said.
Meanwhile, Sheikh Yassin said Hamas would not participate in the meeting of the PLO
Central Council scheduled to take place in Gaza earlier in the month of July. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;We are not participating in a meeting that is based on the Oslo
Accords.&#148; Yassin said, as a matter of principle, Hamas won&#146;t take part in the
Council&#146;s meetings &#147;because all these meetings are based on the Oslo
Agreement.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He added that if the Council decided to rid the Palestinian people of
Oslo, then Hamas would take part in it meetings. Yassin said the problem facing the
Palestinian people was not the absence of Statehood but the presence of the occupation.
&#147;The PLO had declared Statehood several times&#133;.the problem is that this
Statehood lacks sovereignty and substance.&#148;</p>

the door for Palestinian immigration</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Gaza-</b> An official in the Palestinian refugees&#146; popular committees
in Gaza Strip disclosed that the German embassy in Amman had recently opened the door for
immigration of Palestinian refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Abdullah Al-Arabeed said that 35 Palestinian families had immigrated to
Germany last May. He also warned against the purchase of refugees&#146; status cards by
certain parties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabeed, head of the popular committees executive bureau in the Gaza
Strip, said that such practice fell in line with attempts to liquidate the Palestinian
refugee&#146;s issue, which is one of the most important topics in the final status talks
along with Jerusalem, Jewish settlements, sovereignty, borders and the Palestinian state.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He criticized the Palestinian Authority&#146;s stand vis-à-vis the
refugees question, describing it as &#147;ambiguous&#148;. His statements were voiced
during a seminar organized by Kana&#146;an developmental institute at its premises in Gaza
city.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arabeed accused PA officials of openly declaring insistence on the
refugees right of return while in secret or open talks (with the Zionists) they discuss
ending the refugees&#146; problem through depriving them from the right of returning to
their homeland based on different scenarios and projects.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He stressed importance of the role of the refugees&#146; popular
committees in combating attempts to surrender the right of return that was included in the
international resolution 194.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For his part, Abdullah Al-Horani, head of the national center for studies
and documentation has considered the right of return as a sacred right that did not need
any persuasion for it was a legitimate right guaranteed by international laws.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He warned the Palestinian negotiator against signing any agreement that
would not include the national stable rights and that would not ensure a dignified return
and deserved compensation to all refugees.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Horani warned against rumours that attempts to spread the illusion among
the refugees and the public opinion on the impossibility of the refugees&#146; return to
the Palestinian lands occupied in 1948. He charged that such a matter would deprive more
than a million refugees in the West Bank and Gaza Strip from returning to their homes
along with another quarter of a million refugees scattered in the Negev desert and the
Galilee.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He also cautioned against propaganda statements that were intentionally
leaked every now and then on the re-settlement of refugees, and added that the Palestinian
people might understand the Palestinian negotiator&#146;s inability to secure the right of
return and all national rights but would never allow surrendering them altogether.</p>

great Lebanese victory against the Zionist occupation.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He asserted the refugees&#146; insistence on their right of return to
Palestine, and underscored that the refugee camps in Lebanon did not assign any party to
speak, negotiate or surrender on their behalf.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem -</b> The water crisis in the Palestinian autonomous
enclaves has exacerbated further since May forcing Palestinian citizens in large cities
and small hamlets alike to seek water from old contaminated wells dating back to the
Ottoman era.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The severity of the crisis has expressed itself in daily scenes of
Palestinian citizens, young and old, walking the streets seeking to fill their empty
bottles and other plastic containers.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even the main hospital in Ramallah, the unofficial West Bank capital of
the PA, was without water for several hours during mid-June having had its water supply
severed owing to reduced pumping by the Israeli authorities who control water supplies to
the PA enclaves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel arrogates the lion&#146;s share of water in the West Bank and
leaves negligible amounts for the Palestinians.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">According to human rights organizations, the average Palestinian citizen
in the West Bank and Gaza receives an annual water share of 140 cubic metres while the
average Israeli receives 560 cubic metres. The water shortage in the West Bank is
particularly acute in the southern region where the vast majority of Palestinians purchase
