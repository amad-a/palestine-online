<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Arafat, Don&#146;t cross the red lines!</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Occupied Jerusalem &#150; Special to PT</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is amply clear by now that the ongoing round of talks between Israel
and the Palestinian Authority will not yield truly meaningful results, the kind that would
bring about a historical resolution to the Arab-Israeli conflict</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli government is adamant in its refusal to return to the 1967
borders, insists that Jerusalem will remain Israel&#146;s &#147;eternal and undivided
capital&#148;, and vows not to allow the Palestinian refugees to return to their former
villages and towns from which they were expelled at gunpoint in 1948.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the Jewish State effectively refuses to adopt United
Nations resolutions 242 and 338 as a basis for talks with the PA and rejects out of hand
the mere discussion of UN General Assembly resolution 149 which grants Palestinian
refugees the right to repatriation and restitution.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In addition, the government of Ehud Barak is also insisting on merging the
still outstanding interim issues, such as the third phase of redeployment and the release
of Palestinian prisoners, with the final status talks&#150;a ploy clearly aimed at
minimizing as much as possible the area of land that would eventually be handed over to
the Palestinians in the context of a final status settlement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the rising influence of the ultra-Orthodox Shas in
Barak&#146;s government, at the expense of Meretz and the so-called Israeli &#147;peace
camp&#148;, is likely to radicalize the Israeli positions toward the Palestinians even
further.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, the increasing reliance of Barak on Shas for the survival of his
government will most likely reduce to the minimum his ability to make &#147;the difficult
decisions&#148; necessary for the peace process.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, it is widely expected that Barak himself will manipulate his
partnership with Shas, not to further the peace process as he claims but rather to extract
more concessions from PA Chairman Yasser Arafat and to repulse possible international
pressure for Israeli concessions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, Barak would argue that he could not agree to give the
Palestinians any further concessions because his coalition with Shas would collapse
consequently. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Hence, the argument goes, it would be up to Arafat, who does not face
similar problems on his domestic front, to save the peace process from collapse by
conceding on vital issues such as Jerusalem, the refugees and borders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, this seems to be the message Barak is conveying to the Americans,
and one that the Americans would most likely convey to Arafat, namely that the Palestinian
leader ought to understand the &#147;difficult situation&#148; facing Barak and his
inability to accept an agreement that does not command Israeli consensus, in the Knesset
and in the street.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We don&#146;t know as of yet how Arafat will respond to this
conspiratorial diplomacy and sinister connivance between Israel and the United States. But
it is clear that many Palestinians are extremely worried about the possibility that Arafat
may be willing to break the collective Palestinian consensus by caving in to the Israeli
dictates.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestinian anxiety to that effect stems from Arafat&#146;s virtually
complete indifference to the Palestinian public opinion and its rejection of any
American-brokered &#147;compromise&#148; that would sacrifice the Palestinian
people&#146;s historical rights in return for a sham peace agreement or possibly another
Nobel Prize that Arafat might share this time with Ehud Barak.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian leader has given many indications that provoke anxiety
among Palestinians. Some say he has been behaving like an Ottoman Mukhtar who sees no need
to consult his people because &#147;he knows what is best for them.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Americans and the Zionists understand quite well this mind-set of
Arafat and they are trying relentlessly to manipulate and exploit this &#147;valuable
point&#148; in order to wrest additional far-reaching concessions from the Palestinian
leader, as much as possible and as soon as possible, before he &#147;wakes up&#148; or
before he is dead.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this regard, it is possible that the Americans will arrange marathon
talks between Arafat and Barak styled after the Camp David conference of 1978, which
eventually resulted in the infamous Egyptian-Israeli peace treaty.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A replication of Camp David is likely to result in disastrous
ramifications for the Palestinian people for two main reasons:</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First, it is safe to say that U.S. President Bill Clinton&#146;s ability,
and maybe inclination, to exert pressure on Israel will be very weak if not nonexistent.
The American President will soon be out of the White House. And Clinton knows well that
should he seek to push Israel, even nudge her, in any meaningful manner, he would harm the
chances of Al Gore becoming the next President of the White House. Apart from that, it is
well known that Clinton&#146;s desire to convene a Camp David-style conference for Arafat
and Barak&#150;one that would resolve the insurmountable issues of the Middle East in one
month where six years of arduous talks failed to make any breakthrough&#150;is not really
motivated by an earnest desire to resolve the conflict but rather by a personal desire to
attain an important foreign policy achievement, which could qualify him for a Nobel Prize
and help the Democratic Party remain in power.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The other reason that the Palestinian leader seems more willing to cave in
to Israeli-American pressure is on the account that he is so eager to attain his life
dream of seeing a Palestinian State, however small and deformed and un-sovereign it may
be.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In this case, another Camp David would be a unique opportunity for the
U.S. to &#147;brain wash&#148; Arafat and cajole him into abandoning the national
Palestinian constants, all on the ground that negotiations are &#147;give-and-take&#148;
and that peace requires sacrifices and compromises from both sides and that each side
cannot expect to get 100% of what it wants.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Needless to say, such a scenario would be extremely disastrous for the
Palestinian people, since it would enable Israel to arrogate not merely 50% of Palestine
but up to 90% of it, while the remaining dismal 10% will be converted into a truncated and
disconnected bantustan or human reserve, inhabited by over 3 million vanquished and
betrayed souls surrounded by the Israeli army in all directions.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Therefore, and in order to forestall this looming disaster, the
Palestinian people must send an unmistakable warning to the Palestinian leadership that
the rights of the Palestinians are not to be compromised and that Jerusalem is not a
subject of political bargaining. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Arafat must be made to understand that if the current political realities
are not conducive to reaching a just settlement of the Arab-Israeli conflict, the
Palestinians, the Arabs and the Muslims can wait. After all, it is not written in the Holy
Qur&#146;an that the Palestine question will be resolved in Arafat&#146;s lifetime. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Not much of a choice</font></b><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>Abdel-Jawad Saleh*</strong></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The United States and Israel seem to have placed their bets on corrupt
dictators whom they can trust as peace partners. They think dictatorships make the best
neighbours. Their calculations are based on the racist belief that Israel&#146;s
neighbours are divided by tribal, religious and ethnic rivalries. In other words, they are
not worth democracy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On this basis, too, the Israeli Prime Minister sees Palestinian President
Arafat as a more reliable partner in negotiating the final status issues than any
potential successor.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The majority of Palestinian entrepreneurs, who had returned to Palestine
to study the possibility of investing there, have fled because of corruption. The absence
of law constitutes a real threat to investment. A few corruption-mongers have remained,
looking for carrion. They have found that it is easier and quicker to make money by
recruiting the highest-ranking officials as their partners in newly established companies
and monopolies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Public tenders and contracts were tailored to their interests. The higher
the partner&#146;s rank, the more numerous the millions involved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Some of these companies&#146; partnership agreements are not known to the
public. The Palestinian Legislative Council cannot investigate them. The privatization of
the communications sector was planned and executed behind the relevant minister&#146;s
back. He does not know the contents of the agreement, though many years had passed since
it was signed. The company monopolizes communications in PA-controlled areas.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the heads of the security agencies was asked whether some of the
negotiators had entered commercial ventures with Israelis, as rumour had it. He replied in
the affirmative. And why not? After all, ministers and PLC members have entered such joint
ventures, he asserted.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The U.S., Israel and the donor countries are not particularly enthusiastic
about combating corruption. These countries are sacrificing Palestinian democracy and
transparency to entice Arafat into signing an agreement based on Israel&#146;s vision of a
&#147;final solution&#148;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In October 1999, I was invited to attend the International Anti-Corruption
Conference (IACC) in Durban, South Africa. The speaker of the PLC decided not to send an
official delegation funded by the UNDP as a way of preventing me from participating. I
attended anyway, and paid from my own pocket (it cost more than a month&#146;s salary).</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">During the deliberations, I was abruptly prevented from continuing my
speech about corruption in the PA. I had been given the floor as a full member by the
South African Minister of Justice, who was chairing the session. But I was stunned when
Kevin Ford, the American chairman of the IACC Council rushed to the podium and asked the
Minister to prevent me from continuing my speech to the 1,600 delegates assembled.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The social fabric of Palestinian society&#150;its entire value
system&#150;is shuddering under the blows of the PA&#146;s policies. Poverty is spreading
as corruption accelerates. Infighting, still on a limited scale, is being fueled by
dangerous slogans: sectarianism, differences among refugees and locals, between urban and
rural dwellers. These prejudices, and the tension they have engendered, constitute a
phenomenon unprecedented in Palestinian history.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The &#147;Declaration of Twenty&#148; expressed objectively the
Palestinians&#146; disappointment with the PA. The signatories&#146; justified anger with
its handling of the negotiations and support for a corrupt system was the basis for
mobilization toward democratic change.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This climate poses a major challenge to the PA. The ongoing process of
negotiations on the final status issues will determine the nature of the future map of
Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israelis and the Americans are telling Arafat that peace requires us
to forget the past. In other words, we must forsake Jerusalem, surrender the
refugees&#146; right of return, disregard the settlements and the geography of cantons
they perpetuate, abandon the 1967 borders...and the list goes on.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Strategic questions must be answered. There is unanimity among
Palestinians that any leader who compromises on the right of return, for example, will be
signing his own political death certificate. Neither Clinton nor his friends in the
Israeli government are worried about Arafat&#146;s future&#150;after he signs, that is.
Barak, with his myopic perspective, is concerned with winning the hearts of the Israeli
right. Peace does not matter to him.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">If these men fail to understand that a viable peace and a working
democracy will benefit everyone, they will destroy any vestige of good intentions. Peace
and democracy are inseparable in the achievement of a sustainable peace. Yet Arafat has
abandoned all the &#147;non-negotiable&#148; demands of the 10-Point Programme adopted by
the PNC in 1974. He has not only relinquished the call for a democratic State in all of
mandated Palestine, but also backed down on the 1947 Partition Plan. He is now negotiating
a replacement solution comprising only 19% of Mandate Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As for Israel, it is determined to implement a new partition plan in the
territories it occupied in 1967&#150;the 19% left over from Mandate Palestine minus
Jerusalem.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Clinton is eager to induce Arafat to accept the new Israeli partition plan
in the proposed trilateral summit this summer. He is especially anxious to go down in
history as a peacemaker rather than just a womanizer. The Israelis and the U.S. are sure
that Arafat will acquiesce to their demands. They have learned that President Assad&#146;s
death could help a Palestinian-Israeli peace agreement to no end. But I believe that the
shadow of Hizbullah&#146;s victory will haunt Arafat. The envisaged &#147;peace
agreement&#148; will be neither just nor sustainable. It will be a trap into which Arafat
will fall headfirst, and a dump where the Palestinians will be able to bury their hopes
and their aspirations.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The PA will become a new South Lebanese Army. Israel will become the
Apartheid State of the twenty-first century. It will use its prowess and its nuclear
threats to bully the whole area into submission. And everyone will lose, in the absence of
a peace that lives by the principles of a new century: democracy, human rights, good
governance and civil society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The victims, of course, will be the overwhelming majority of Arabs and
democracy itself. The Palestinians, however, will lose the most. The reaction that will
rise from the ashes of frustration, apathy and repression is difficult to predict. The
PA&#146;s policies&#150;deinstitutionalization, destruction of social values, a legal
vacuum, the absence of sovereignty and the alienation of the people&#150;will drive the
Palestinians inexorably into the trap of violence. If the emerging independent leadership
succeeds in mobilizing a non-violent struggle, then&#150;and only then&#150;will the
Palestinians be on the right track toward achieving their just and legitimate rights.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000"><b>Khalid Misha&#146;al: Hizbullah&#146;s victory
in South<br>
Lebanon is a slap on the capitulationists&#146; faces</b></font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Occupied Jerusalem - Khalid Misha&#146;al, the head of Hamas politburo,
believes the success of Hizbullah&#146;s resistance in ending the Zionist occupation of
southern Lebanon is a striking vindication of Hamas&#146;s line. Misha&#146;al has no
illusions about the differences between the Lebanese case and the Palestinian situation.
However, he firmly believes that unless the Zionist regime is made to suffer and feel the
pain, it will never come to terms with the Palestinian people&#146;s rights.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The following are excerpts of an interview with Misha&#146;al.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Question:</strong> Would it be possible for Hamas to do in
Palestine what Hizbullah did in Lebanon?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Answer:</strong> To begin with, I would like to congratulate the
Lebanese people and Hizbullah for this great victory over our common enemy. As for the
question, I believe that a victory over the Zionists in Palestine would ultimately be
possible, God Willing, provided those elements conducive to successful resistance be made
available. Indeed, if neighbouring countries provide material support and political and
security coverage for the resistance, the Lebanese situation can be replicated. I assure
you that we in Hamas have the will and the determination to fight, and I assure you that
we will continue to fight until victory is achieved.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Don&#146;t you think that what the Palestinian
Authority is doing (the Oslo process) contains an element of wisdom and political
farsightedness given the geopolitical map of the world today?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> I see no wisdom in what the PA is doing. It is not
wise to lend legitimacy to the usurpation of one&#146;s homeland and the usurpers; there
is no wisdom in cooperating and collaborating with the enemy against your own people and
nation, and there is certainly no wisdom in ceding your historical and inalienable rights
to the enemy. We must also remember that the negotiations between Israel and the self-rule
authority of Yasser Arafat is over the West Bank and Gaza, an area that doesn&#146;t
exceed 22% of Palestine. Moreover, the PA has not obtained much anyway, as the area now
under full PA administration is no more than 21% of the 22% of Palestine which consists of
the West Bank and Gaza Strip. And even this small area is not really controlled by the PA;
it only exercises limited administrative authority. So, is it wise to give up the vast
bulk of our historical rights in favour of this crumb? I don&#146;t think that any
Palestinian, Arab or Muslim in his or her right mind would accept this.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> But do you still believe that the military option is
still valid?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Nobody should say the military option is no longer
valid, especially after the striking success of the resistance in South Lebanon. Indeed, I
believe the resistance is the most valid and most important option. History teaches us
that only through force, struggle and resistance can occupied land be liberated. Yes, this
is not going to be easy, and it is not going to be realized tomorrow, but it is the right
path to genuine liberation and true freedom.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Some say that the best option is &#147;economic
boycott&#148; and other forms of passive resistance?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Yes, but in addition to economic resistance, we need
to enable our people to put up a sustained resistance against the enemy. We also need to
put an end to the process of normalization with the Zionists, and instead invest more
effort in building our own strength as a nation and an UMMA [community]. After all, the
Zionists don&#146;t target only the Palestinians; their strategy encompasses the entire
Arab-Muslim people in the Middle East. It is time we understand this and devise
comprehensive strategies to counter Zionist hegemony.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> How do you see the role of Hamas in the period ahead?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Hamas has no choice but to keep up the struggle. We
say that with the realization that sustaining the struggle and Jihad involves a price, but
we have no choice but to pay that price, because the alternative is submission and
capitulation to the enemy.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> What is the strategy of Hamas for the foreseeable
future, and do you coordinate with Hizbullah?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> We do have good relations with the Lebanese
resistance. This is quite natural because we all fight the same battle against the same
enemy. As to our strategy, it is based on the continuation of resistance and removing
obstacles from its path. Hence, resistance is our choice and option and there can be no
abandonment of this option no matter how large the sacrifices and how far ahead the
destination.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> What do you say about the arrest of Mujahed Muhammed
Dheif by PA police?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> The PA disseminated some rumours to that effect which
we think are part of the misinformation campaign against us. The truth is that Dheif was
arrested by the PA at Israeli instructions. It is amply clear that the PA acts at
Israel&#146;s beck and call. And we warn the PA against handing him over to the Zionists
and we demand that he be set free immediately.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> What is your advice to the Muslim youth in Palestine?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> I fully understand the plight facing Hamas as well as
other Islamist and nationalist forces now operating under the self-rule regime; I
understand the repression meted out to patriotic Palestinians. However, as I said in my
earlier answers, there is no alternative to steadfastness and patience and resilience. The
followers of Islam must keep up the struggle and remain faithful to our sublime and just
cause. The battle is with the enemy and with nobody else; hence, we must refrain from
having secondary battles here and there. But we must do all we can to expose the vile
practices of the self-rule authority against our people in the hope that it will revert to
its senses.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Could you describe for us the status of Hamas in
Palestine now?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Hamas in particular and the Palestinian people in
general have been under a tremendous amount of pressure from the Zionist regime and the
self-rule authority alike. This resulted in incalculable suffering, pain and losses. But,
again, this is part of the price we have to pay for the path of resistance and Jihad as
set down in the Holy Qur&#146;an. But Hamas will overcome its difficulties and emerge
triumphant. I am absolutely sure about this.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Is it true that some Arab governments, in particular
Qatar, have succeeded in containing Hamas?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Our deportation from Jordan and the closure of the
movement&#146;s office in the Jordanian capital was part of a sinister conspiracy against
Hamas that was aimed at serving the Zionist regime. (The Mossad tried to assassinate
Misha&#146;al on 25 September 1999, in the streets of Amman!!) As to our relations with
Qatar, they are based on mutual respect, mutual understanding and mutual cooperation, all
in the service of the Palestinian cause. Hence, our relations with Qatar are not based on
containment or anything of this sort. Hamas, after all, has its own outlook and can&#146;t
be contained.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Where is Muhammed Nazzal?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> He is being hounded by the Jordanian intelligence
services, which forced him to go underground. We ask Almighty God to preserve him and
protect him. There is no doubt the Jordanian authorities have failed to apprehend him, or
else they would have arrested him a long time ago.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q: </strong>To what extent are you optimistic about the reopening
of Hamas&#146; offices in Jordan?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Despite our unjust deportation, it is clear that the
Jordanian people are on our side. This means that Hamas lives among its people in Jordan
as in Palestine. In the final analysis, Hamas represents and expresses the aspirations and
hopes of our people for a better tomorrow whether in Jordan or in Palestine. But I can
tell you that Hamas won&#146;t be far away from Jordan for a long time. We are still
determined to regain our right to return to Jordan.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> Have the operations of Ezzul Deen al-Qassam come to an
end?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> It is true that our military struggle has been
undermined by the American-led onslaught against Hamas, which finds expression in the PA
crackdown on and hounding of our Mujahideen. So, we have had a situation where the Zionist
regime, the U.S., the PA and other parties are ganging up on Hamas. However, we will
overcome these obstacles because our Cause and The Almighty will not let us down.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> If somebody wants to join the Mujahideen of Hamas,
what should he do?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A:</strong> Jihad for Palestine is an imperative duty upon all
Muslims. Palestine is an Arab-Muslim land housing al-Masjidul Aqsa, the third holiest
Islamic shrine in the whole world. Muslims can support Hamas morally and financially, and
the day will surely come when the doors of Jihad in Palestine will be open for all.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>Q:</strong> From the beginning, Hamas adopted a wise approach
towards the PA. Will this continue?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong>A: </strong>Hamas has forborne so much pain at the hands of the
Palestinian Authority. Hamas chose not to respond to the provocative actions of the PA not
because we are weak, but in order not to harm the collective interests of our people. This
policy of ours is paying off, and today we see how the bulk of the masses are moving away
from the PA.</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong>(1-2)</strong></p>
</i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">No issue in the world today has more intricately intertwined elements than
Palestine/Israel. Even the most minute changes in the economy, political thinking, or
social structures if experienced on one side, affect the other. If the Israeli economy
takes a shift up or down, the Palestinian worker and his family feels it. If the
Palestinian worker were to stage a boycott or a work stoppage, the Israeli economy would
be affected to some degree. When political sentiments among Israeli citizens shift on
issues of peace, policies are changed in Palestine to reflect these changes in political
priorities. When Palestinian youth become restless, Israel usually manages a minor
concession that lets some steam out of the always boiling Palestinian pot.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Palestine/Israel is a conglomeration of complexities not found in any
other single area of conflict in the world and does not fit neatly into any single or
simple definition of conflict. For this reason the Palestinian politician has been
confounded and has responded with an instinctive reflex to these complexities that has
caused the Palestinian leadership to address negotiations and Similar issues of importance
to Palestine from perspectives and positions disguised as &quot;political
pragmatism.&quot; In fact, this &quot;pragmatism&quot; is nothing but uninspired political
confusion and a demonstrated inability either to understand the essence of its own
Palestinian being or to project this essence into a world that neither understands nor
believes that Arab/Muslim/Christian Palestine once existed as a culture and a people. If
outsiders understood or believed this, it might be possible for them also to believe that
the on-going elimination of these people is an act of genocide as deplorable as the
Holocaust. Israel has managed to portray itself as part of the cultural and religious
fabric and history of Palestine. Israelis viewed as the indigenous owner of the land in
need of the world's protection to save its legacy, its people, its rights and its future
from the Palestinian usurpers of rights and legitimacy. This view is false.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The so-called &quot;pragmatism&quot; of Palestinian politicians will be
shown here to be a defeatist approach to a winnable situation. This defeatism is the
result of a spiritual malady and will cease to exist only when the Palestinian leadership
accommodates itself to Islam.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">while Arabs and Palestinians were adopting the cynical slogan &#147;the
era of ideologies has died in favor of pragmatism,&#148; Israel was increasingly
fortifying itself behind ideological, religious, and historic rhetoric. Israel knows that
it possesses no legal and objective justification for its occupation of Palestine. All it
has are its false claims. Stranger still is that the Palestinian side would stoop so low
as to accept those claims as excuses for the continuing problems of occupied Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Gaza-Jericho First agreement was preceded by Arab agreement to attend
the Madrid conference and this was no more than an embodiment of the obvious fact that
Arab strategic thought had collapsed. The peace process was designed to solve Israel's
difficulties, particularly its difficulty in securing the occupation. All subsequent
security agreements have been at the expense of the Palestinians.</p>
<b>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000">The Problem: Compounded Reading</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Two views regarding the Palestinian issue have been around since the
Balfour Declaration of 1917, which called for the establishment of a Jewish homeland in
Palestine. The first rejects Balfour's promise to the Zionists with the argument that
Britain had no right conferred upon it through international law to give a mandate to a
group of people to govern another a country that belonged to an indigenous people, nor did
Balfour have any right or ability give anyone the tight to Palestinian land or natural
resources. Balfour did not have the right to bring another population (Jewish) to replace
the original residents (Palestinians) in preparation for the establishment of a Zionist
state. This view was represented by the Arab and Islamic countries. The only exceptions
were pre-revolution Iran which had deep ties with Israel and Tunisia, whose president at
the time, Habib Bourguiba, thought it was better to accept U.N. Resolution 181 of 1948,
which gives the Palestinians 46 percent of the land and the Jews 54 percent.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The second view was put forward by Zionists who argued that this was the
beginning of the fulfillment of the divine promise to the Sons of Israel that they would
return to the &quot;Promised Land,&quot; the &quot;Land of the Forefathers.&quot; They
turned a blind eye to Jewish criticisms of the promise because it deleted some territories
out of the supposed Promised Land, such as Jordan. Western countries supported the Balfour
Declaration based on strategic interests that were not necessarily void of religious
prejudice.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">These two views provide the foundations for the arguments submitted by the
two interests, Arabs and Zionists. Zionists used religion and a contrived
&quot;Lord's&quot; pledge to the Sons of Israel to return to the Promised Land. The
official Arab-Islamic position was secular and based on legality Ironically Muslim and
Christian Arabs completely ignored religion, while the Zionists, who are secular, used
religion to make the convincing and successful argument that the land of Palestine was
rightfully theirs by a promise from God. While the British promise was adopted by the U.N.
General Assembly and Security Council, Arab nationalists who were guiding the Arab
response to the challenge adopted international law in support of their protest against
the Balfour Agreement.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From the outset of the crisis, the Arabs agreed that the issue should be
referred to the United Nations. It was clear to all that the United Nations would not
issue a decision that contradicted the desires of the United States, which had founded the
United Nations as a vehicle through which it could govern the world. Understanding that
they did not have the political backing to make a compelling case that could counter the
Zionists' argument, which was backed by American money and might, Arabs went to the United
Nations expecting to be defeated.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Palestinian issue exposed a huge gap in the official Arab-Islamic
rhetoric and its legal sources on the one hand, and the sentiments of the Muslim masses,
on the other, who immediately resorted to their religious Islamic sources for
understanding and comfort. According to these sources, most notably the Qur'an, Palestine
belongs to the land of Islam. Palestine is an Islamic trust to be preserved by the
generations, and it is forbidden to concede it until the Day of Judgment.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The official Arab rhetoric was contradictory and did not represent the
sentiments of the majority of Palestinian Christians or Muslims. The Arab response to the
crisis was first to call for the return of all of Palestine. This demand was reduced to a
call for a Palestinian state on some part of Palestine, and finally they demanded a
solution to the &quot;Palestinian Problem.&quot; By contrast Zionists became militant,
holding fast to their false religious decree and using any means they could to grab as
much land and as many &quot;rights&quot; as the United Nations would allow.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is not honest to say that Zionists never changed their tune or argument
in the course of events following the partitioning of Palestine. Yet any Zionist desire to
compromise or any amount of flexibility on their part were never apparent. The Zionists
showed flexibility only after the Arabs had been brow beaten and frustrated and worn down
to the point where they were willing to accept almost any solution to the conflict. The
result was that Israel accepted Palestinian self-rule over the Palestinian people, but
rejected Palestinian rule over the land. The Israeli Zionists had no objection to a
limited self-rule entity custom-tailored to Zionist conditions, standards, and interests,
with no sovereignty or jurisdiction. This Palestinian enclave was never going to cover
more than 16 to 18 percent of historic Palestine (27,000 sq. km). In return the
Palestinians, Arabs, Christians, and Muslims, would recognize not only Israel's existence,
but sadly, its right to exist as the owner of the land.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel's acceptance of the Madrid negotiations, its signing of an
agreement with the PLO, the establishment of a Palestinian Authority in parts of the Gaza
Strip and West Bank, and the signing of a peace treaty with Jordan represent a mature
response and deep Israeli understanding of the nature of the changes in the Arab region
after Gulf War II, and the changes in the world's geopolitical outlook following the fall
of the Soviet Union.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Zionists took advantage of an historic opportunity that probably would not
occur again. Israel achieved the crucial recognition of its existence in the area as a
natural, not artificial, entity. To accomplish this required only that it discard Gaza, an
area with almost no strategic or economic value to Israel in comparison to what Israel
gained. By giving Gaza to the Palestinians, Israel distanced itself from the poverty, high
birth rates, and other social problems associated with the area, thereby protecting Israel
from the consequences of the refugee camps and poverty it had created. What Israel had
essentially done was to wrap all of its occupation problems and by-products in an Oslo
agreement and throw it away.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Why is Israel's acceptance of the Madrid invitation considered a practical
response, while Arab acceptance is considered impractical? For Arab leaders to attend the
Madrid conference equaled official recognition of Israel as a nation/state in the Middle
East. For Israel its long sought dream was to be legitimized by such acceptance.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Madrid conference caused a major change in the nature and the scope of
the conflict. Previously it was a pan-Arab conflict that included all Arab countries (the
Islamic dimension had already been excluded by the Arab governments). After Madrid, it
became a problem entrusted to the surrounding countries (Syria, Jordan, Egypt, Lebanon and
the PLO by extension). Shortly thereafter it became a Palestinian issue that was subject
to the Israeli demand that all negotiating tracks be separated. This series of events
produced the Gaza-Jericho First catastrophe. The Arab acceptance of the Madrid conference
miniaturized the Palestinian issue from the pan-Arab level to the regional level and
finally to an exclusively Palestinian affair.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On another level this Arab acceptance exposed the depth of the crisis in
Arab strategic thought and the extent of the impotence it had reached. The invitation came
during a period where there existed divisions in the Arab ranks following Gulf War II.
Israel knew this all too well. The Zionists stipulation to separate the negotiating tracks
as a condition for negotiating with the Arabs was based on Israel's view that the Arabs as
a whole do not have one unified demand from Israel; rather, every country has its own
concerns that it would like to talk to Israel about - and nothing else. This view was
tacitly accepted by the Arab countries without any elaboration.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Arab body had collapsed after Gull War II and intra-Arab disputes
flourished. The strategic balance of power was not in the Arab's favor after Iraq was
defeated militarily, at least not on the regional level. On the international level, the
Arabs were asserting that the collapse of the Soviet Union had eliminated a strong Arab
position. All of these justifications were presented under the guise of &quot;political
pragmatism.&quot;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We need not engage in a debate on history or a round of objections and
counter objections. But some quick notes are in order on what the &quot;Arab embellishment
mentality&quot; presented as givens. First the Arab armies had never fought a real war
with Israel. In 1948, most of the Arab countries were occupied, under mandate, or
protectorates of Western colonial powers that supported the Zionist position. Arab
participation in that decisive battle was under whelming.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The amount of Arab participation in that decisive battle was less than
required. The seven Arab armies that participated had 25,000 soldiers. The Zionist forces
had 65,000 soldiers, with some estimates higher and some lower. The Egyptian forces fought
with malfunctioning weapons and there was no trust between Arab political and rnilitary
leaders.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the 1967 war, Egypt was surprised as were the other Arab countries that
border Israel and all found themselves forced to enter the battle without any preparation.
The result was that Israel occupied six times its area in six days. Despite the relative
victories achieved by the Syrian and Egyptian armies in 1973, the strategic goal of the
war for those two countries was not the liberation of Palestine. In the end, both armies
were almost defeated. One entire Egyptian battalion was surrounded and would have been
wiped out if it were not for international intervention to end the war.</p>

Palestinian Exile</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Daud Abdullah*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the surface, there was nothing unusual about the <i>Ma&#146;ariv</i>
report published on 1 June 2000, that being President Bill Clinton&#146;s intended
proposal to settle Palestinian refugees in America during forthcoming talks with Israeli
and Palestinian leaders. It was, after all, just another Western gesture&#150;the likes of
which landed Canada&#146;s Prime Minister Jean Chretien into trouble during his Middle
East tour two months earlier. There was, however, a certain irony about the Clinton
overture. That it should come from a former Governor of Arkansas on the eve of the
fiftieth anniversary of the Israeli Law of Return. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Had political and economic conditions been different, Arkansas could well
have been the modern Jewish State, and a consequent thorn in the soft underbelly of the
United States as it is today in the heart of the Arab and Islamic lands. For when an
anonymous pamphlet appeared in Germany in 1840 advocating the creation of a Jewish State,
it rejected Palestine for practical reasons. Alternatively, it suggested Arkansas or
Oregon as places where Jews could develop their full potential. With the memories of the
American war of independence still fresh in their minds, no European power was, it seemed,
prepared to sponsor such a colonial enterprise. Ultimately, the dismemberment of the
Ottoman Empire during the first quarter of the twentieth century offered the perfect
platform for the establishment of a mandatory authority in Palestine&#150;one that placed
the country under such political, administrative, and economic conditions that helped in
the establishment of a Jewish State there.</p>
<u>

<p ALIGN="center"><strong><font color="#FF0000">Destruction</font></strong></u></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In Zionist thought, a main function of the State of Israel is to
&#145;gather the exiles&#146; and make it possible for all Jews to immigrate to the
country. Soon after its formation the provisional government abolished restrictions on
Jewish immigration and land sales to Jews. The passage of the Law of Return on 5<sup> </sup>July
1950 was, therefore, one of the most decisive pieces of legislation adopted by the Israeli
parliament throughout its entire history. It grants every Jew from all over the world the
right to immigrate to the country. Prime Minister Ben Gurion emphasized this purpose
during the debate leading to its adoption. He declared that the State of Israel &#145;is
not a Jewish State merely by virtue of the fact that Jews constitute the majority of its
population. It is a State for Jews wherever they may be, and for every Jew who desires
it.&#146; With this understanding, the Law of Return has since remained a guiding pillar
in Israeli legislation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By extension, the creation of an exclusive Jewish State in Palestine
necessitated the destruction of its society. Like the rhythmic pumping in and out
operations of the heart, the success of the Zionist project was always dependent upon two
interlinked operations. These being the transfer of Jews from their respective countries
and settlement in Palestine, and the uprooting of the indigenous Arabs and their mass
expulsion from Palestine. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Despite its undisguised objective, the Law of Return could not have
functioned independently. To maximize effectiveness, it had to be complemented by other
pieces of discriminatory legislation known as the basic laws. Of these, the Absentee
Property Regulations were of critical importance. The apparent aim of this latter was not
simply to acquire the property of the evicted Palestinians but, worse still, also block
their return and eventual legal claims for stolen property. In effect, the return of the
Jews required much more than the dispossession of the Palestinians. Their national
identity and existence as a people had to be denied if not ruined. Hence, they were
deliberately referred to as &#145;absentees&#146;. This was the same logic that informed
the text of the Balfour Declaration and caused it to refer to the Palestinians simply as
&#145;non-Jewish communities&#146;.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Though based on claims of &#145;historic&#146; and &#145;divine&#146;
rights to the &#145;promised land&#146;, Israel&#146;s Law of Return was, for all intents
and purposes, a convenient vehicle for settler occupation. Its discriminatory nature was
predicted and condemned long before it was actually legislated. Edwin Montague, a
prominent Jew and former Secretary of State for India, warned of the consequences of such
legislation based on &#145;a bigoted and narrow view of one particular epoch of the
history of Palestine, and claim for the Jews a position to which they are not
entitled.&#146; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Without becoming involved in the sterile debate of who is and who is not a
Jew, it suffices here to note that at least one third of those who emigrated from the
former Soviet Union to Israel during the last decade were not recognized as Jewish by the
country&#146;s religious establishment. This development has not only belied the attempt
to create an exclusive Jewish State but it also undermines the rationale for denying
Palestinian return. With similar concerns and doubts being raised about other emigrants
from Eastern Europe and Africa, world Jewry has been forced to urgently redefine itself.
In Britain, steps were taken in this direction two years ago with the setting up of a
19-member committee to consider, among other matters, the age-old question of &#145;who is
a Jew?&#146; The report of the committee, entitled <i>A Community of Communities</i>, was
released in March 2000. It ruled that being Jewish has little to do with religion and that
Jews should dispose of their religious identity and &#145;rebrand&#146; themselves as an
ethnic group. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The ramifications of this report will no doubt go well beyond Britain. And
as far as the Zionist objective to &#145;in gather the exiles&#146; is concerned, it
offers a suitable loophole and excuse for the continued emigration of every Tom, Dick and
Harry to Palestine, regardless of their religious background or convictions. Be that as it
may, it is equally important to recall here that the Jewish religious establishment
throughout Europe had long condemned the colonization of Palestine. Shortly before the
convening of the First Zionist Congress in 1897, the &#145;Headquarters Tent&#146; of the
Lovers of Zion in Britain announced that it would have nothing to do with the attempts to
colonize Palestine. In Vienna, the Chief Rabbi, Moritz Gaudemann, similarly published a
violently hostile anti-Zionist pamphlet. He insisted that the Jews were not a nation and
that Zionism was contrary to the teachings of Judaism. At the same time, the German
rabbinate publicly denounced the attempts to create a Jewish State in Palestine as
contrary to the Holy Writ. Because it had no relation to the acquisition or protection of
the religious rights of Jews, the Balfour Declaration was addressed to the financial
magnate Lord Lionel Rothschild and not to any recognized religious body.</p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="center"><u><font color="#FF0000">Abolition</font></u></b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">From that time onward, the demographic transformation of Palestine was
effected at every stage by force of arms and superior political power. There are few
observers today who question the fact that the Palestinian exodus was born of terror and
bloodshed. Ten years ago, this view was considered as &#145;revisionist&#146; in Israel.
Today, it is accepted as mainstream. By itself this recognition will remain a dead letter
if it is not supported by serious calls by all concerned, not least of whom are
Israel&#146;s new historians for the abolition of the Law of Return. If only because of
its discriminatory nature and the massive injustice it symbolizes, this law must be wholly
and irrevocably abolished as a first step toward the restoration of Palestinian rights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">With the final status issues now on the table, the Palestinian leadership
must now determine the timing and not the propriety of a Palestinian law of return.
Because the Palestinians in the diaspora have affirmed their desire to return to their
areas of origin, such a move may open avenues of achievement that perhaps would never be
opened at the negotiating table. And since this right of return is both an individual and
collective one, there must be clarity and coordination between the leadership and people
of Palestine about how to translate it into reality. By holding out the possibility of
recognizing a Palestinian State in the West Bank and Gaza Strip, Tel Aviv hopes,
nevertheless, to resolve the refugee problem by exchanging the right of return for a
truncated and demilitarized Palestinian State. A Palestinian law of return must,
therefore, not only grant nationality to the refugees but also equally affirm their right
to return to any part of historic Palestine from which they were evicted. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Inevitably, the proclamation of a Palestinian law of return would be met
with cries of anti-Semitism, anti-Zionism and anti-Israelism. Such propagandist measures
should not be allowed to cover up the fact that Palestine belongs to the Palestinian
people. Had this not been the case, Article 7 of the mandate would not have required
provisions &#145;so as to facilitate the acquisition of Palestinian citizenship by Jews
who take up their permanent residence in Palestine.&#146; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the same way that Columbus claimed to have discovered the Americas
after finding the Amerindians there, so too the Jews came belatedly to Palestine and found
the Canaanites&#150;from whom the Palestinians have descended&#150;and claimed it to be
theirs. In this light, the usurpation of Palestine and its conquest through immigration
did not divest the Palestinians of ownership of their land. Neither has their protracted
exile deprived them of the right to live there. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">By being a silent observer of the wrong done to the Palestinians, the
international community has become as equally guilty as those who have executed the crime.
The claim that the Israeli Law of Return was never aimed against the Palestinians but only
intended to favour Jews is as baseless as it is inconsistent with the facts. It is like
saying all men are equal but some are more equal than others. For when the Palestinian
refugees were attempting to return to their homes, their efforts were obstructed by the
1950 American, British and French Tripartite Declaration, which opposed any attempts to
change the borders between the Arab States and Israel. Fifty years later, the borders are
still not demarcated, the refugees remain behind the fences and international forces are
permanently stationed to keep them out.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Neither Arkansas nor Oregon did become the Jewish State in the nineteenth
century as proposed, yet at the onset of the twenty-first century the federal union as a
whole has become Zion to many because of the preponderant influence of the Zionists there.
Is this the beginning of the nemesis that history promises those who commit and condone
wrong? There may be one way of verifying this as well as the viability of the Israeli Law
of Return. Perhaps Washington should accede to Israeli requests and lift the visa
requirements for Jews into America. Though by no means a substitute for the implementation
of UN resolution 194, this may yet be a major step toward preventing Palestine from
becoming a world ghetto. </p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Shahid K. Bolsen</i></b><u></p>
</u>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">An editorial appeared in the Israeli newspaper <i>Ha&#146;aretz</i>
recently that requires a few corrections and is worth responding to.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The author, Amnon Rubinstein, argues that Israel is unfairly criticized
for denying Palestinians the right to return to their homes, while other countries with
refugees have not been similarly criticized. Rubinstein specifically mentions India.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">&#147;Millions of Muslims who fled from the Indian section of the Indian
subcontinent to seek asylum in the Muslim section, namely in Pakistan,&#148; Rubinstein
says, are denied &#147;the right to hold Indian citizenship.&#148; </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">He uses this idea, as a basis for defending Israel&#146;s denial of the
Palestinian right of return. It is, however, a problematic comparison to say the least,
and, indeed, a few of Rubinstein&#146;s conclusions are either intentional obfuscations or
else the result of underdeveloped logic.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rubinstein paraphrases section 7 of India&#146;s constitution at one point
saying, &#147;All persons, even if they had Indian citizenship at the time, who, after 1
March 1947, emigrated from the territory of India to the territory that is today Pakistan
are not regarded as citizens of India. Not only does the Indian constitution deny the
right of return to Muslim refugees; it even cancels their previous citizenship.&#148;</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">First of all, that Muslims who migrated to Pakistan will not be considered
citizens of India is perfectly reasonable: they are Pakistanis. What the Indian
constitution is essentially prohibiting is dual citizenship, and Rubinstein fails to
mention that this rule applies to any and all Indians who migrate to any and every country
outside of India&#150;not only to Muslims who move to Pakistan. An Indian Hindu who moves,
for instance, to England, or even to Israel, under section 9 of the Indian constitution,
will not be considered a citizen of India. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Furthermore, the conclusion Rubinstein draws that the Indian constitution
denies Muslims in Pakistan the right to return is erroneous. If he had read section 7 a
little further, he would have read that &#147;a person who, after having so migrated to
the territory now included in Pakistan, has returned to the territory of India&#148; will
be granted citizenship. So, in fact, India does recognize the right of return. But here we
get into the more complicated differences between the India-Pakistan/Israeli-Palestinian
comparison.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To be brief, the partition of India and the creation of Pakistan were not
the result of massive foreign migration, as was the case with the creation of Israel.
Muslims in India suffered considerable social discrimination as a minority among a Hindu
majority, and were, as a group, fundamentally different from the mass of the Indian
population. The creation of Pakistan was not the result of Muslims taking
&#147;refuge&#148; in Pakistan during the civil war of 1947-1948, as Rubinstein suggests,
but rather as an expression of profound nationalism. In short, the great majority of
Muslims who migrated to Pakistan cannot strictly be referred to as refugees and would not
have the slightest desire to return to the India that had for so long regarded them as
lower than the Untouchables. The reason for the partition and the establishment of Muslim
Pakistan was precisely because the great bulk of Hindu and Muslim Indians simply could not
live with each other any longer. The idea that Muslims were somehow forced to leave India
to escape war is simply not supportable in the majority of cases, and, as mentioned, if
there were any Muslims who sought to return to India, they were legally permitted to do
so.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rubinstein compares the partition of India with the proposal to partition
Palestine during the British mandate saying, &#147;the Arab States and the Palestinian
leadership of the late 1940s refused to accept the principle of the partition of
Palestine,&#148; unlike the Muslim leadership of Pakistan, who, he says, &#147;did accept
the principle of the partition of the Indian subcontinent.&#148; Rubinstein should perhaps
be reminded that Pakistan <i>accepted </i>the partition of India because they <i>proposed</i>
the partition of India, unlike the Arab States and the Palestinian leadership with the
partitioning of Palestine.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rubinstein makes another interesting point, which deserves some
consideration; he says, &#147;of the tens of millions of refugees on the face of the earth
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, only the Palestinian refugees were not fully integrated
into the societies in which they found themselves.&#148; &#147;In which they found
themselves&#148; is a curiously passive phrase, as though their status as refugees is
almost accidental. But more importantly, Rubinstein is blaming the Palestinians for not
relinquishing their culture and legitimate rights to their homeland, and implying that if
only they had tried harder to assimilate to foreign societies, perhaps they would not
desire to return to their land of origin. One must wonder, then, about Zionism itself. Is
it not an expression of a people who could not fully integrate &#147;into the societies in
which <i>they</i> found themselves,&#148; whether Eastern Europe, the Soviet Union or
America? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">And here is the fundamental difference between India and Israel, and here
is why, as Rubinstein says, &#147;critical sociologists have decided that a special law
applies to Israel and that the same laws that apply to all the other democracies of the
world do not apply to Israel.&#148; The case of Israel <i>is</i> different than any other
modern State that comes to mind.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The creation of Pakistan, unlike Israel, did not <i>replace</i> a State.
India did not cease to exist as a State because Pakistan was established; the partition
allowed for the mutual division of territory between two States. Meaning, of course, that
a &#145;refugee&#146; ceased to be a refugee because he became a Pakistani. The creation
of Israel, of course, negated the Palestinian State. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Perhaps here it will be argued that the Palestinians had the option to
accept partition of their territory, and refused. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is useful to compare again the situation of Pakistan and India. Here,
partition was an agreement between <i>two indigenous peoples</i>. The northern region of
India was chosen precisely because there was already a significant Muslim majority there.
This cannot be said of the Zionist choice of Palestine where Jews constituted a tiny
minority. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Muslims living in the territory that became independent Pakistan were
not opposed to the creation of the State, again, unlike the indigenous residents of
Palestine concerning the imposition of the Zionist State. If India had driven out the
Muslims from the subcontinent completely to declare India a Hindu State, perhaps there
would be a closer comparison to Israel. However, this did not happen, and so the
&#147;critical sociologists&#148; Rubinstein refers to <i>do</i> single Israel out,
because this is precisely what happened in Israel, and there are simply no other examples
in modern history where this has taken place without international intervention on behalf
of the indigenous people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Rubinstein says that &#147;a special law applies to Israel,&#148; implying
that Israel alone is criticized for not allowing refugees the right to return. In fact, he
is right. Israel is the only country which can prohibit the right of return for refugees
and <i>only</i> face criticism and not international sanctions or United Nations
intervention. The refugees of Kosovo, East Timor and Serbia are only a few recent examples
of international pressure ensuring the rights of refugees to return to their homes, while
Israel is immune to such intervention.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Israel faces the criticism because it does not permit what every other
democracy in the world does permit&#150;including India&#150;and that is, of course, the
right of return.</p>

<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Ramzy Baroud</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was nothing less than a triumph for humanity on Tuesday, 23 May when
one of the world&#146;s most brutal occupations tumbled, tearing down with it lingering
myths of the &#147;undefeated army&#148; and &#147;The Greater Israel.&#148; Twenty-two
years of deception-filled propaganda, napalm and more napalm, tens of thousands of
murdered innocents, United States vetoes and billions of dollars of American money proved
to be worthless compared to the spirit of the fighter, held by an oppressed nation. And
among the many symbols of oppression, Khiam prison gigantically stood as a reflection of
the hideousness of Israel, and a symbol of the durable Arab and Lebanese spirit. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">History repeated itself on that day. Well over 200 years ago, the
repressed French masses stormed the Bastille, setting free the anguished prisoners and
proving that injustice may prevail for a time, but never indefinitely. When hundreds of
Lebanese farmers stormed Khiam prison, a facility controlled by Israel and its militias,
the remarkable images of the past came back to life. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">One of the many photos taken on Khiam Day was of two men standing face to
face. Nothing separated them except the bars of a dark cell. The man who was about to be
freed was weeping while pushing his face against the rusty metal bars. The man outside was
ready to tear the bars down. In the back, several prisoners stood in disbelief, ready to
be embraced and supported on the shoulders of their liberators, closer to the sun. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fleeing interrogators never bothered to clean the scene of their crime
at Khiam, leaving behind the whipping poles, the torture chambers, the electric wires used
on naked prisoners after soaking them with cold water. Finally, Israel&#146;s savage
inventions were laid open. Israel&#146;s decades of denial of human rights reports on the
barbarous treatment of prisoners were finally proven a lie. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Lebanese resistance&#146;s liberation of the South was a happy ending
for only one chapter of Israel&#146;s book of crimes against humanity. Before moving to
the next chapter, important points should be emphasized lest they are forgotten. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Many American mainstream commentators desperately submitted articles and
columns the day following the Israeli withdrawal from South Lebanon, demanding that the
US, the UN and others interfere to guarantee Israel&#146;s security. The arguments used
could be summed in theory that looks like this: &#147;Well, Israel has left Lebanon, as
you wished. What are you going to do to protect its civilians?&#148; Such an inconceivable
approach to the issue highlights the intentionally misinformed American perception of
Israel&#146;s conduct&#150;Israel is not an aggressor nor are its violations of every
human norm relevant to any judgement; only Israel matters, so let us do everything we can
so as to protect it from its evil neighbours. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For 22 years and after the killing of tens of thousands of innocent
Lebanese and Palestinians in Lebanon (compared with the deaths of 900 Israeli occupation
soldiers), somehow Israel remains, in the eye of the US media at least, the poor
defenseless victim that had to massacre thousands of innocents to protect its northern
villages (which, strangely enough, happens to be occupied Palestinian land.).
Israel&#146;s war crimes must be exposed and, like Nazi and Serb war criminals, Israelis
must be brought to justice. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Is there any rationale that may create a doubt in the fact that the same
tactics used in Khiam are used today against thousands of Palestinian and Arab prisoners
inside Israel? Despite the hunger strikes and the frequent riots, torture chambers remain
intact, as do the interrogators, the electrical and whipping poles, the rape and even
execution-style murders of defiant prisoners. It is likely that those torturers who lost
their jobs as Khiam was abandoned will quickly be given new duties in Al-Ramlah prison,
Al-Lled, Majiddo or elsewhere. Such a realization must be an incentive for those who
genuinely care for human rights to confront Israel and to demand the release of all
Palestinian and Arab prisoners. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On 23 May, the world failed to see the magnificence of the human triumph
in Lebanon, which can hardly be viewed apart from the ongoing war against oppression and
tyrannies worldwide. On 14 July of each year, France celebrates Bastille Day with a
never-fading pride. &#147;Khiam Day&#148; must be celebrated by all Arabs, not just the
Lebanese. And soon, we can only hope that Palestinians will have a reason to celebrate the
day when their loved ones are liberated from the dark dungeons of Israeli prisons. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Testimony of an Ex-POW</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Fuad Hegazi</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The writer of this testimony is an ex-soldier in the Egyptian armed forces
who served during the 1967 war between Israel and Egypt. He was captured by the Israelis
on the very first day of the war and remained a prisoner for eight months. He is currently
author of several novels. This is his testimony of the atrocities committed by the
Israelis. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I was serving in the paratroops battalion. We were approaching a place
called Gerada, half way between El-Arish and Garallah, when we first saw the Israeli
tanks. We took refuge in a huge hall, at the nearby railway station. The Israeli tanks
swept over the station and flattened it out, with the people inside. We had some old
weapons that were useless then. They entered the place not with the intent of taking
hostages or prisoners of war, but clearly to cleanse the area. They went in turning the
corpses, stealing the gold and money, as well as the important identity cards such as
those belonging to the Egyptian intelligence. We were wounded, and they were surprised to
find us. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our battalion was not alone in that place; there were hundreds of other
soldiers who had been lost, roaming in the desert for days. Their fate had led them to us
in Gerada, near the railway station. All in all there were nine soldiers alive, all
wounded. One had a bullet in his arm, another had his intestines falling out of his
stomach. The enemy clearly did not need prisoners on that first day of the war, and they
killed everybody. Luckily, on 6 June, an officer told them that their leadership was
ordering them to take us as prisoners. I later came to realize that on that date, there
were 9 pilots who fell as prisoners of war at the hands of the Egyptian army, and they
spared our lives to trade us for them. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They ordered us to sleep on the floor on our stomachs, and the tanks
started rolling towards us. We understood they would run us over. The sound of the tanks
chains approaching near our heads was terrorizing. Some of my colleagues had white hair
from shock! They then ordered us to stand up, and they moved us to a prisoners&#146; camp
in Rafah. We were all wounded. They asked us to spread on the ground; then they showered
us with bullets over our heads. Anyone who raised his head so much as one centimetre was
instantly murdered. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was hot, and we were bleeding. There were no toilets in those camps.
Anyone who requested to go to the toilet was told to dig a hole in which he was thrown and
murdered. No one asked for the toilet again! The bullets persisted throughout the 6<sup>th</sup>
of June. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF"><strong>The Seventh Day</strong></font></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">On the seventh day, our capturers threw us in trucks, tying our hands
behind our backs to the seats. It did not matter whether a soldier was wounded or not,
capable of moving his arm or not! They tied us regardless and drove us towards Israel. At
the border, every time they suspected there was a Palestinian resistance ambush, they
untied us and used us as shields, walking in front of the trucks. They told us: &#147;Die
at the hands of your own brethren!&#148; Many of us died from our own peoples&#146;
bullets. If any of the Israelis were wounded or dead, they used to start their ad hoc
firing. We stayed this way till we arrived at Al-Magdel, where there was a camp for
prisoners of war. </p>
<i>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><strong><font color="#0000FF">The Eighth Day</font></strong></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The camp was without toilets. This was our fourth day in a row without
food or water. The families of the Israeli soldiers who had been murdered in combat were
brought in to see us. They attacked us, squeezed our wounds, spat at us and stoned us. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They had to move us to another camp in Atleed. This is when the terror
trip began. We had to ride a train used for transferring cattle. The cars had no windows
or light. In a car that would normally take 10 people, they squeezed in more than 150.
They closed the doors with huge locks. This lasted from 10 o&#146;clock on the morning of
8 June till 12 midnight of 9 June. We lost all sense of time. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The fifth day began. We were sitting on top of each other in the car. Our
blood mingled with each other&#146;s. We defecated on each other, thinking we were
defecating on the floor. After we discovered this humiliation, we clawed the floor and dug
holes through which we could defecate. Those holes also gave us some air to breathe. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The train stopped. They emptied the trucks. Between 10 and 15 soldiers
died on that trip. They made us stand in lines at the station and fired bullets over our
heads. Many died. I was unable to count the dead. The Israelis deliberately shot at some
of us. As soon as the bullets ceased, the families were brought in to stone us and spit at
us, violating the remaining fragments of our humanity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I can never forget one sight, however. Without concern for the spitting
and the raining bullets, my comrades suddenly saw a water hose. They crossed all
boundaries of fear and rushed towards it. The Israelis shot at us. Our blood was mixed
with the water, but we never stopped. They finally stopped shooting. Each one of us drank
from the hose and left it to the next soldier, only to pull it again, hug it, pour its
water on our fully clothed bodies and torn wounds. I remember I returned to that hose six
times that day. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The gathering at the arrival station ended. They brought garbage cars to
transfer us to the camp. I remember its smell to this day, and it makes me feel nauseous.
We arrived at the camp...still without food or water. They did not notify the Red Cross of
our presence until four months after our imprisonment! </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Atleed Death Camp</font></b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The first thing we ate was bread. Every eight soldiers were allowed one
loaf of ordinary-sized bread. There was also an onion for every five prisoners. In the
evening it was the same, in addition to one turnip for every four. They gave us one glass
of water in the morning and another in the evening for every five prisoners. There were
two holes in the ground covered with a wooden seat. This was our toilet. It was not
sheltered with any curtain, and we had to relieve ourselves in front of everyone. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We slept on the cement floor, on straw mats. In winter they gave us rotten
blankets that smelled horrible. We gathered a few of them and made curtains for the
toilets. We spent four months without bathing because the water was barely enough to
drink. We stayed without cure for our wounds and without change of clothes. We smelled of
blood and sweat. Some of the wounds oozed with pus and were full of squirming worms. We
cleaned the worms with tree leaves. Some died from their wounds. When the Red Cross
arrived, they were shocked from the worms and lice that were eating our bodies and hair.
We used to scratch until blood oozed out. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We organized a demonstration, but they fired at us. Many died. We wrote
complaints to the Red Cross, which arrived after four months. After their intervention,
they allowed us one bar of soap for every 7 prisoners and opened the taps for bathing for
only one hour a day, to allow one hundred prisoners to bathe! Anyone who tried to bathe at
any other time was instantly murdered. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">Rabin&#146;s Visit</font></b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">There was a white chalk line near the barbed wires. Anyone who approached
close to it to even try and breathe the fresh air of the nearby sea was murdered. We
demonstrated once again. Yitzhak Rabin, the Israeli Chief of Staff, came to us in a
helicopter and sat with some of the more important Egyptian generals. The food was then
enhanced from turnip to minced beef whose expiry date was long gone and that smelled
rotten. Nevertheless, we ate it to live. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was tragically funny that we found some Israeli soldiers smoking the
Cleopatra brand of cigarettes, and we understood that gifts had come to us which they
stole. After negotiations with the Red Cross, we finally received some of the presents. We
offered them as bribes to the Israeli guards to allow us to do a few extra things. Despite
all that torture, we wrote plays and poetry, and organized cultural lectures for the
less-educated soldiers. </p>
<i><b>

<p ALIGN="LEFT"><font color="#0000FF">The Road Home</font></b></i></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Jordanian POWs were released one week after they were arrested. The
Syrians after one month. As for us, the Egyptians, we stayed eight months. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">I later realized, from the writings of Mr. Mohammed Hassanein Heikal (an
Egyptian journalist and historian), that President Nasser refused to trade us with nine
Israeli pilots and two Israeli spies! He said spies were not to be traded with soldiers,
without bothering with our situation. We totaled 5,580 prisoners of war, all in all, among
us 50 generals in addition to the education commission to Gaza, which included male and
female teachers who were not young in age, and the medical commission with physicians and
nurses. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">After pressure from the families of the POWs who met with Nasser, he
finally relented and agreed to trade for us. We were back home. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">What Is Israel Really Up To?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Fatima Hamilton</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The world was shocked to see Israel withdrawing its troops from South
Lebanon so abruptly. Barak had promised a withdrawal in July. So, why so early? Well,
after years of occupation, they finally found out it was not effective. The resistance,
Hizbullah and other Muslim groups were too strong for them. So, actually they ran away
defeated. However, there is more to it than that. There are two things we can learn from
this event. First, resistance can work and secondly, the Israelis have another plan
because they don&#146;t give up easily. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The resistance in South Lebanon is akin to the Intifidah in Palestine,
which hit the Israelis hard and put fear into their hearts. Even though they are
militarily stronger with advanced weapons, they still were afraid and were losing. Why?
Because those stripped of their rights have a cause&#150;they enthusiastically fight for
freedom and to gain their basic human rights. What do Israelis fight for? They say they
are defending themselves, but actually they fight offensively with the goal of widening
their borders and building more settlements. They have no enthusiasm, only fear. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, Palestinians were able with the Intifidah to force the Israelis to
search for peace. Actually, this is not a real peace but they are buying time and taking a
rest. Even the problem of South Lebanon has forced them to give up the occupation, but
this is also buying time. They have other plans. So, what are their plans? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">We can learn from what happened after the Intifidah to guess what may
happen in the future in South Lebanon. After the peace talks began and Arafat was named as
the President of the Palestinian State, the Israelis began putting off the peace talks and
changing the former agreements. So they are not serious about peace. They are not fighting
the Palestinians directly but rather indirectly. Yet, it is still occupation and a
criminal act. They supported and arranged for Arafat and his group to lead small
Palestinian-controlled areas and to have their own police force. In many cases, this
police force is working against Palestinians. It arrests, imprisons and tortures other
Palestinians who are still searching for freedom. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The same thing may happen in South Lebanon. They pulled out quickly and
Hizbullah, Ammal and other Muslim groups moved in to secure the South. Now, they are
celebrating victory. But what about the future? Israel lost a lot of soldiers by being in
South Lebanon and they don&#146;t want to lose anymore. They know the area is not
completely stable. Lebanon has had a history of civil war that carried on from the 1960s
to the 1980s because it is a mixed State of various religions and groups. Israel&#146;s
occupation of South Lebanon for the past 22 years helped to bring all the groups closer in
a common cause to free the land. So, the Israelis decided to pull out and to break the
solidarity. They will probably try to aggravate sore spots between different groups in the
hope of causing another civil war. They would rather have the Arabs kill each other
instead of losing more Israelis. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">They also want to put pressure on Syria to agree to peace&#150;without
getting back the Golan Heights, if possible. They want the Syrian soldiers to become
unnecessary in Lebanon and they hope the Lebanese will kick them out to gain total
freedom. So, the Israelis would like to create problems between the Arabs and thereby
disunity. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Another possibility could be that they hope for instability to occur in
the region in order to expand their borders. They&#146;re just waiting for the golden
moment. If it comes, then surely they will push further into Lebanon, maybe taking it all,
and into other Arab countries as well. Their Zionist State motto is: &#147;Israel from the
Nile to the Euphrates.&#148; This endangers not only Iraq, Lebanon, Syria, Jordan and
Palestine but also other North African countries. Their Zionist appetite is insatiable.
The only reason they left South Lebanon is because things got too hot for them. The reason
they allowed some Palestinian-controlled areas is because they could not take the
pressure. They are now looking for a different method to achieve their aim&#150;a subtler
one. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Of course, they may hope to weaken the Arabs and to force them to take
&#147;peace&#148; at any price. Or, because they have been defeated, they may just enjoy
seeing their foes punishing each other and revile in this joy of revenge. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Whatever their reasons, Israel does not leave any place without some kind
of back-up plan. When they plan, they plan well. So, we know they have left South Lebanon,
to the jubilation of its population, but then, what&#146;s next??</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">Where Edward Said got it wrong</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Khalid Amayreh</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In his article, the &#147;Landscape of Opposition&#148; (<i>Al-Ahram</i>
weekly, 8-14 June 2000), Edward Said pointed out that he was convinced that the
&#147;secular opposition&#148; in the Arab world would ultimately win out over its
Islamist opponents. And his rationale is that the Middle East is too much of a
heterogeneous, politically aroused and modernized region to submit to what are in effect
backward-looking, absurdly anachronistic visions that aim at establishing Muslim and
Jewish theocracies.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Said&#146;s secular outlook is well known, of course, and he is completely
justified in seeking to vindicate his convictions to that effect. However, his wholesale
condemnation of Islamic movements shows a conspicuous absence of an objective analysis of
a phenomenon so deeply rooted in Arab society as the Islamic resurgence of which
&#147;political Islam&#148; is merely one layer of its diverse and multifaceted structure.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is somewhat lamentable that Said, who has always been at the forefront
of exposing and refuting the West&#146;s malicious misconceptions concerning the Palestine
question and other Arab causes, seems in this instance to be repeating similar Western
misconceptions about the Islamic movements, which the West, particularly the United
States, has come to portray as the &#147;new evil empire&#148;, in lieu of the former
Soviet Union.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">As a scholar of great stature, Said should have made a more objective
prognosis of Islamic movements aspiring to re-institute the Shariah law, including their
attitudes toward civil society and its pillars, such as human rights and civil liberties.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Today, the bulk of Islamic movements in the Arab world&#150;from the
Muslim Brotherhood in Egypt to Al-Nahdha in Tunis&#150;readily accept the principles of
civil society. Indeed, in some Arab countries, the Islamists are at the forefront of
societal and political forces calling for political pluralism.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In many instances, the Islamists also often cooperate with non-Islamist
forces in promoting human rights and civil liberties wherever allowed by the regimes. Last
week, for example, Islamist and leftist demonstrators protested outside the PA
headquarters in Nablus, in the West Bank, demanding the release of the teacher unionist
activist Omar Assaf, who is affiliated with the Democratic Front for the Liberation of
Palestine, which is a hard-line Marxist group. The protest bore fruit, and Assaf was
released a few days later.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It is true that much remains to be done in this respect, but the mere fact
that the Islamists or many of them are willing to collaborate with non-Islamist groups for
the common good of society ought to be lauded.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Indeed, it is the Islamists, not the secularists, who are paying a
manifestly heavier price for the enduring despotism and police-State structure of
contemporary Arab regimes. Hence, it is in their interest to expedite democratic reform
and to be instrumental in fostering a new political environment based on civil society.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Said is right in saying that the Middle East is heterogeneous. However, it
is equally true that the vast majority of the masses in the Arab world would want to see a
tolerant, egalitarian and democratic Islamic democracy whereby the people can enjoy the
fruits of liberty without abandoning Islamic principles or sacrificing Islamic values.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In other words, the masses want neither democracy without Islam nor Islam
without democracy; they want to have them both and combined. This trend, which assumes
dormant and active manifestations depending on the margin of democracy available seems to
be utterly uncomfortable for the West and the U.S., which explains Western and American
opposition to genuine democratization in the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Do the Islamist movements look backward and are their visions
anachronistic? Indeed, what is backward? What is anachronistic? In this world there are
fixed and constant values transcending time and place. For example, the fact that the Ten
Commandments were sent down to Moses on Mount Sinai three and a half millenniums ago
doesn&#146;t make them less irrelevant today than they were then.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Likewise, the lofty Islamic principles, most of which are actually
universal anyway, can&#146;t be dismissed as simply anachronistic and &#147;backward&#148;
on the mere account that they are 1,500 years old! Then, ironically, democracy, which is
older than Islam, would be condemned as even more anachronistic and more backward.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Moreover, the subtle lumping by Said of &#147;Muslim and Jewish
theocracies&#148; is unacceptable, especially from a scholar of undeniable rectitude.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">To begin with, there is no such a thing as &#147;Islamic theocracy&#148;.
A theocracy is a government ruled by the clergy or claimed to rule by divine law. In
Islam, however, the distinction between clergy and laity does not exist, and the masses
have the ultimate authority over the rulers who are answerable to the people.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">More to the point, there is a fundamental difference between Islam&#146;s
perception of non-Muslims under Islamic rule and Judaism&#146;s perception of non-Jews
under Jewish rule. In the first example, non-Muslims are virtually equal citizens; in the
second, they are virtually slaves. Dr. Said would probably be surprised to know that the
very last words uttered by the Prophet Muhammed were &#147;<i>istawsu Be-ahli al-Kitabi
Khayran</i>&#148; (Be nice to the People of the Book). Hence, the analogy and lumping of
Islam with Judaism is extremely tendentious and corrupt.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Apart from that, it is amply clear that secularism is inherently
incompatible with the basic pillars of contemporary Arab-Islamic culture. Actually, it is
this intrinsic dichotomy that enabled the Turkish people to withstand 80 years of
aggressive and compulsive secularization which has been sustained only through military
dictatorship. It is that contradiction that caused even the most avowedly
&#147;secular&#148; of Arab regimes to maintain a &#147;ministry of religious
affairs&#148; and even occasionally seek to emulate radical Islamists by pretending to
safeguard Islam and protect its values.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Historically and culturally, secularism is a foreign, exotic concept that
can&#146;t grow naturally in the Arab-Muslim world. Moreover, most of the factors that
were instrumental in the evolution and consolidation of secularism in Europe several
centuries ago simply don&#146;t exist in the Arab world.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">For secularism to take root in the Arab world, there would have to be a
fundamental transformation of the Arab identity and culture. This would necessarily
involve the removal of Islam from the hearts and minds of Arabs and Muslims. It would also
entail that all or most Islamic values pertaining to public life be abandoned and replaced
by imported values from the West. This would amount to a comprehensive ghoulish
metamorphosis haunting the collective and individual Arab identity.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">This is so because Islam and its values now fill the &#147;vacuum&#148; in
the Arab world as has been the case for the last 1,400 years, and secularism can&#146;t
possibly fill that vacuum without removing Islam and all that it represents.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">In the final analysis, secularization in the Arab world would require a
process of profound and sustained &#147;de-Islamic-ization&#148;, something I believe the
vast bulk of Muslim Arabs would utterly reject and resist.</p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Palestinians Right of Return</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Dr. Musil Shihada*</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Israeli Knesset voted recently that the Palestinian refugees right of
return could only be accepted if approved by a two-thirds majority by members or by an
Israeli public poll. Unfortunately, our Palestinian leadership has echoed such a travesty,
ignoring in the process that such rights are not subject to a vote or a public poll but
are rather inherent rights embodied in all international declarations on human rights.
Such rights then could not be abrogated by any poll, be it Israeli or even a Palestinian
council decision. To leave such an important issue to the final negotiations would simply
imply that the Palestinian refugees right of return is subject to further negotiations, in
flagrant violation of all international laws and United Nations resolutions. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It should be clearly understood by our leaders and political thinkers that
the Palestinian right of return to their homes and properties is a basic and natural right
inherited by the new generation. It is a right confirmed by international laws and
conventions, first of all UN resolution 194 (11 December 1948), the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights of 1948 (paragraph 9), the Nouremberg Convention and the Fourth Geneva
Convention. The latter defines mass eviction and deportation as a war crime against
humanity. The right to live in one&#146;s homeland is a basic and absolute right, which
may not be abrogated even in case of war or occupation. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">International law experts, including some inside Israel, are convinced
that the implementation of the right of return is a binding condition for the recognition
of the State of Israel. As a matter of fact, Israel&#146;s acceptance as a member of the
UN was conditional on its commitment to abide by the UN Partition resolutions 181 and 194
of the right of return (Lusanne, 10 May 1949). Therefore, abiding by international law,
Israel has endorsed that its own recognition by the international community was
conditional on its own acceptance of these two resolutions. Such international principles
render any Israeli or even Palestinian public consensus on this important issue a practice
in theatrics. Such a clear international position on the issue of refugees and their right
to return is further confirmed by the UN in its adoption of resolution 237 (14 June 1967),
which calls for the unconditional return of the Palestinians displaced in the 1967 war,
and the facilitation of their repatriation by the Israeli government. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It&#146;s quite unfortunate that many Israeli apologists, echoed by our
desperate leaders, claim that it would be a mission &#147;impossible&#148; and very
unpractical to demand the implementation of such internationally recognized principles.
How and in what manner could we demand from Israel the implementation of such resolutions?
Wouldn&#146;t this mean the eviction of Jews from lands they are presently living on? Are
we not in effect asking to turn the clock back 50 years ago? Is there enough space in
Israel for the accommodation of such a Palestinian return?</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Frankly speaking, I cannot with all honesty feel sympathetic to such
Zionist concerns. He who created the problem should be held responsible for its solution.
If we are to worry about such actions, then we can simply accept all the Israeli
settlements built on the West Bank on Palestinian land and acquiesce to the status quo
while our Palestinian refugees remain rotting in their subhuman conditions of the refugee
camps. If the Zionists convinced the world to turn the clock back 2,000 years, I think it
would be relatively quite a modest request to demand the clock be turned back 50 years! In
my modest opinion, one need not go to such limits when we realize that there is enough
space in Israel to implement all UN resolutions <i>vis--vis</i> the Palestinian refugees
without any further evictions of any other nationalities. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">It was reported in the <i>Jerusalem Post</i> on 23 October 1998 in an
editorial by Jonathan Rosenblum that over 400,000 non-Jewish Russians using the Israeli
Law of Return were admitted into Israel in 1990 alone! When we condemn the Israeli Law of
Return as a racist Law enacted exclusively for the Jews, are we further supposed to accept
those non-Jewish Russians taking over our lands when our refugees are barely surviving in
refugee camps? Am I supposed to worry about the non-availability of space in Israel for
the return of our indigenous people to their homeland, when Mr. Barak demanded last year
from the American Jewish organizations to send over to Israel another one million Jews as
their greatest gift to the Jewish State? </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Our people have suffered enough and we should end their sad ordeal by
demanding their unconditional right to return to their homes and properties. Their destiny
should never remain captive to those racists who are asking us to resettle them somewhere
else. Such demand contravenes every international law enacted by modern man. Such rights
should never be tested by Israeli or Palestinian consensus since human rights are inherent
rights that are not for public debate. Our people and leaders should understand that by
accepting a vote on such an important issue, they are crossing the red line by practicing
a travesty beyond their jurisdiction. Israel or Mr. Arafat does not decide my human rights
for that matter and no one on this planet can deprive me of my right to live in my
homeland with independence and dignity, not Israel, not the new Jewish immigrants and not
the non-Jewish Russians. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Campaigns should be launched everywhere to bring to international public
opinion such important issues. Our leadership should withdraw immediately from all
&#147;peace&#148; talks unless the right of return tops the agenda of discussions. I would
support a consensus that would ask the general Palestinian public to decide on a new
leadership that is less eager to sell our rights down the drain of political expediency.
It&#146;s time that new blood be infused into the present leadership so as to rectify the
enormous damage that has been inflicted on our cause. </p>

<h3 ALIGN="center"><!--mstheme--><font color="#CC3333"><font color="#FF0000">The Best Human Rights: Islam Or Western
Philosophy?</font><!--mstheme--></font></h3>
<i>

<p ALIGN="center">Lena Winfrey Seder</i></b></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The West boasts that it has the best code of human rights. Yet, do we
really see it in their societies? Women, minorities and children still do not have their
full rights or respect. Unfortunately, the same is true for women, minorities and children
in Muslim countries&#150;countries that have neglected to follow Islam as it should be
practiced while calling themselves Islamic governments. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Well, in all faiths and at different times throughout history we find that
not always do followers follow the correct doctrine of their religions or even
philosophies. However, there is always the chance in an Islamic System for reform and
maybe the West can learn real human rights, if it would inspect the true Islamic code of
life. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Yes, the West has set out rules for the right to life, for example the
United Nations Declaration of Human Rights. Many Western countries are against
discrimination against women and minorities, or so it appears on the surface. However,
Islam takes human rights further than any philosophy, government or religion ever has. It
was given to humankind by Allah, the Creator and Law-Giver, without humans having to fight
for these rights. We can see the exercise of full human rights in Islam in dealing with
men, women, wives, husbands, children, parents, neighbours, servants and even prisoners
(whether in jail or captured in war). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The general rights for both men and women are as follows: the right to
life, food, clothes and housing. Also, they have the right to be treated with respect and
dignity. They both are encouraged to study because Islam has even made it a duty upon them
to seek both religious and academic knowledge. This emphasis on seeking knowledge is found
in both the <i>Qur&#146;an</i> and hadith of the Prophet, peace and blessings be upon him.
Both are allowed to work, though women are encouraged to work in jobs more suited to their
natures. A woman can use her mind. She can be a doctor, nurse, lawyer, teacher, professor
or engineer. She is encouraged to raise her own children, and should, but this does not
mean she cannot work. She could even work out of the home or if the children go to school
she could work part-time. However, small babies and teenagers need the most care.
Teenagers need mothers (and fathers) to be beside them as friends who have time to advise
them. Anyway, women are not always at home with children. Life changes. She needs to be
flexible and follow her duties where they lie. She can work before marriage, before
children, when the children are older and in school, and after they have grown up and left
home. So, she needs to be well educated, which also helps her to raise her children well,
to give her more opportunities for when she is able to work or is forced to work as in the
case of financial problems. Islam gives her the freedom to work whenever she can. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Women are highly respected as mothers. She keeps her father&#146;s name
rather than taking her husband&#146;s name, thus keeping her own identity. Women are
entitled to dowries. Women are entitled to maintenance by husbands (and as girls by their
fathers). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Both men and women have their own possessions and one spouse may not
forcibly take the other one&#146;s possessions. However, most couples choose to share and
this is all right as long as both parties agree. Both are allowed to inherit from dead
relatives; no one is left out and everyone has some share. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islam emphasizes the good treatment of orphans and honest dealing with the
property of orphans. If a citizen has no means of support for himself or his family, then
the society and the State are responsible for them. Men and women are equal, but they have
different roles that must be respected and are equally important. In Allah&#146;s eyes,
they are equal. Both are punished equally for sins and rewarded equally for good deeds.
Women and men have the right to vote for their leader and to freely express their opinions
(which is something we rarely see these days). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Women as wives have special rights as well as responsibilities. The
Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) told men to be kind to their wives. They should
be respected. He should show respect for her feelings and show her compassion. The husband
must fully support her, even if she is rich. She is not entitled to give him any of her
money unless she chooses to do so as a gift and a kindness from herself. She is also
responsible to guard her husband&#146;s home and possessions while he is absent. She must
also protect herself; she is only for her husband. Also, the man is not supposed to commit
adultery; this is sinful and punishable in Islam. The wife must raise her children well.
When the husband comes home from work she should look nice for him and comfort him. She
should give him love and support him emotionally and morally. She should encourage him to
do good deeds. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Also, the man is responsible to give his wife emotional and moral support.
Both should share in religious activities together. They should strengthen each other and
encourage each other to do good things. The husband is supposed to protect his wife and
support her basic needs as well as support their children. He should also give his time to
his wife and children to strengthen their bond and the family. Strong families will create
a strong, moral society. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The husband has the right to be respected by his wife. She should not
offend or hurt his feelings either. He should be obeyed. Of course, the man should respect
his wife and her opinions and he should consult with her, but the decision finally rests
with him. Why? This is fair because every country has a president or king, every city has
a mayor and every home needs a representative and Allah has named the man to be the leader
in his own house. Otherwise, there would be chaos. If a country had two kings, there would
be civil war. So, logically there must be one leader, even in the home. However, Islam
emphasizes consultation in all matters. It is an important &#147;democratic&#148; feature.
Husband and wife must be responsive to each other and learn to cooperate. Allah tells us
in the <i>Qur&#146;an</i> how the husband and the wife should be: &#147;And it is a sign
of Allah that He has created for men, of themselves, mates to seek in their company peace
and tranquillity, and has set between them mutual love and mercy&#133;.&#148; (30:21). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Children also have the right to respect and kind treatment. They need
compassion and mercy. They are to be maintained with food, clothing and shelter. They
should be given love. They are not to be abused. Even their opinions should be heard; they
should not be shut-up. They should be able to discuss things when they are older,
especially as teenagers. A child has the right to life. Islam is against abortion though
it is permissible if done to save the life of the mother. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Parents are also to be respected and obeyed by children, but Allah says if
the parents are trying to get the child to do sinful things, then the child must not
listen to them. His obedience is to Allah before anyone else. Children are not to abuse
their parents. They should help their parents during old age and take care of them, for
their parents raised and took care of them when they were small and unable to care for
themselves.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Neighbours should be secure and safe from his Muslim neighbour. If a
neighbour is in need, then the Muslim should help him. The Prophet (peace and blessings be
upon him) said, &#147;Nobody can be a true Believer if his neighbours pass the night
hungry while he has his belly full.&#148; Gifts and sharing of joys and sorrows should be
exchanged between neighbours. Once the Prophet (peace and blessings be upon him) asked a
group, &#147;Do you know what the rights of a neighbour are? Help him if he asks your
help; give him relief if he seeks your relief; lend him if he needs a loan (without
interest); show him concern if he is distressed; nurse him when he is ill; attend his
funeral if he dies; congratulate him if he meets any good; sympathize with him if any
calamity befalls him; do not block his air by raising your building high without his
permission; harass him not; give him a share when you buy fruits, and if you do not give
him, bring your puchases right to your house quietly and let not your children take them
out to excite the anger of his children&#148; (from <i>Islam in Focus</i> 122). This goes
further than any Western philosophy. In their laws, the neighbour and servants do not have
stated rights. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Servants are to be treated like brothers and sisters and not like
&#147;slaves.&#148; They should be treated well. Servants, in particular full-time
servants, are &#147;entitled to justice, kindness, mercy, food, clothing, accommodation
and other personal expenses&#148; (<i>Islam in Focus</i> 122). They are not supposed to be
overburdened with work. Employers and servants are equal as human beings. The servant
still has dignity. &#147;All citizens of a real Muslim society stand on equal footing
because Islam does not recognize the caste system or the second-class citizenship&#148; (<i>Islam
in Focus</i> 122). No one is superior to another except in piety. Allah says in the <i>Qur&#146;an</i>
&#147;&#133; the most honoured of you in the sight of Allah is (he who is) the most
righteous of you&#148; (49:13). </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Prisoners in a jail or prisoners of war are not to be beaten or tortured.
They are to be fed and taken care of. They are even entitled to respect; they are still
human beings. Prisoners in a jail should only be there after a trial. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Islam thinks of everything. Even the animal has its right. It is not to be
beaten or tortured, even in slaughtering it for food. It should not be frightened before
death. It should not see the knife, and the knife should be very sharp when one slaughters
in order to be merciful and ease its pain. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Even in war, the enemy should not be tortured or mutilated. If he will not
surrender and keeps fighting you, then when you kill him you should do it in the quickest
and most merciful way. Allah is the Most Merciful and He likes those who are merciful. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A Muslim must even take care of the environment around him, which almost
gives the environment rights, too. </p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">So, who has the Best Human Rights? Western countries or a truly Islamic
country?</p>

<p ALIGN="center">Israel Shahak and Norton Mezvinsky</p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#000000">Part 10</font></b></p>

<p ALIGN="center"><font color="#FF0000"><strong>The Two Main Haredi Groups</strong></font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">A brief consideration of the historical background should provide a basis
for understanding the differences between the two major Haredi groups: the Ashkenazi and
the Oriental, formerly called Sephardi. Throughout most of their history, Jews lived
scattered in different countries. Not surprisingly, separate Jewish communities emerged,
comprised of Jewish residents of a single country, of a cluster of countries or sometimes
of different parts of a single country. Until about AD 1050 one particular community
existed as a Jewish centre, recognized by other communities as the authority for dictating
rules and issuing instructions binding upon Jews throughout the world. The last such
centre was the Jewish community of Iraq. After the collapse of the last centre in Iraq,
the differences between Jewish communities deepened considerably. Different communities,
for example, although keeping and using some of the ancient prayers common to all Jews,
composed new prayers, used only in their own services. Even the chanting of prayers in
different communities changed and thus varied. Religious rules of conduct in almost every
conceivable area of life, to which pious Jews adhered, also changed to some extent and
varied from one community to another.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Ashkenazi community that emerged in northern France and western
Germany between the tenth and twelfth centuries became more innovative and began to
deviate more from previously established patterns than any other community with the
possible exceptions of small communities in remote countries, such as Georgia. The
Ashkenazi divergences became embedded and persisted. Until this day<sub>3 </sub>for
example, most pious Ashkenazi Jews refuse to eat meat or any foods containing meat that
are prepared under supervision of non-Ashkenazi rabbis; pious members of other Jewish
communities are content with dietary supervision of rabbis not belonging to their
community. Thus, a pious Sephardi Jew, visiting a pious Ashkenazi Jew will eat food
prepared by the latter, but a pious Ashkenazi Jew visiting a Sephardi Jew will refuse to
eat any foods containing meat or often any food whatsoever. Ashkenazi exclusiveness is
evident in many other aspects of their religious conduct. Sephardi Jews, on the other
hand, developed as early as the twelfth century an exclusiveness of their own, based upon
the consideration that they were superior in some ways to other Jews. The Spanish and
Portuguese Jews, a part of Sephardi Jewry,<sub> </sub>especially developed a pride in the
supposed &quot;purity of descent.&quot; (In Hebrew Sephardi means Spanish.) Most of them
not only refused to marry but also often despised being together with Ashkenazi Jews.
Moses Maimonides, who lived until 1204 and was both a rabbi and the greatest medieval
Jewish philosopher, moralized in a testament addressed to his son:</p>

<blockquote>
  <p ALIGN="LEFT">Guard your soul by not looking into books composed by Ashkenazi rabbis,
  who believe in the blessed Lord only when they eat beef seasoned with vinegar and garlic.
  They believe that the vapor of vinegar and the smoke of garlic will ascend to their
  nostrils and thus make them understand that the blessed Lord is near to them .. You, my
  son, should stay only in the pleasant company of our Sephardi brothers, who are called the
  men of Andalusia [or southern Spain, then ruled by the Muslims] because only they have
  brains and are clever.</p>
</blockquote>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Similar statements, in which members of a Jewish community express
feelings of their superiority over other Jews, abound in Jewish literature and are common.
Even as late as the 1960s older Sephardi rabbis and other Jewish men in Jerusalem, when
signing their names, would invariably add the Hebrew initials meaning &quot;pure
Spanish.&quot; Ashkenazi exclusiveness, as it developed and deepened over centuries,
however, became more all-encompassing and extreme than Sephardi exclusiveness.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The developing exclusiveness had geographical, social and political
causes. Prior to the formation of the Ashkenazi community, almost all Jews lived in the
Mediterranean basin or in countries, such as Iraq, connected with the basin by trade
routes. In the tenth century most Mediterranean countries were under either Muslim or
Byzantine rule. The communications between this region and the emerging feudal Europe were
tenuous largely because of the language barriers: Greek and Arabic, spoken on the one
side, were largely unknown in Western Christian areas, while Latin was largely unknown in
the Orient. Jews, who almost always spoke the language(s) of the people among whom they
lived, encountered the same communication obstacle as did other people. The Ashkenazi
community, therefore, framed its own life style without knowledge about or guidance from
the older, Jewish communities. The Ashkenazi Jewish life style developed within the
context of the emerging feudalism in Europe, which differed in many crucial respects from
other regimes in other areas in that time period. In spreading eastward into the emerging
states in central and eastern Europe, the Ashkenazi community solidified its cohesiveness
and its identity: these have persisted to date but in more pronounced forms among
religious rather than secular Ashkenazi Jews.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Expelled from Spain in 1492 and from Portugal in 1498, Sephardi Jews not
only settled in but also transformed other Jewish communities. In these communities the
new Sephardi immigrants tended to maintain an exclusiveness and to remain aloof from other
Jews. Having come from the relatively developed society of the Spain of the Renaissance
and having settled in less developed countries, they soon became the wealthiest, best
educated and most politically connected Jews in Mediterranean countries. The Sephardi Jews
that settled in Saloniki (now in Greece but then part of the Ottoman Empire) received
privileges from the Ottoman Sultan, because they manufactured the best cloth and provided
textiles for the uniforms worn by members of elite units of the Ottoman army. The Saloniki
Sephardi Jews kept this monopoly for 130 years, losing it only when more modem textiles
were imported from England and the Netherlands. Spanish Jews mostly and Italian Jews to a
lesser extent actually did most of the creative work in all areas of medieval Jewish
culture. Largely because of their wealth and education, Sephardi Jews imposed their
customs, language and name upon Jewish communities in all the countries to which they
emigrated. One good illustration of this occurred in Jewish communities in the Balkans and
what is now Turkey. The Jews in these communities called themselves &#147;Romaniole,&#148;
taken from the popular name of the Byzantine Empire &#147;Romania.&#148; They spoke Greek
until about 1550 at which time, influenced by the effects of the Sephardi immigration,
began to call themselves &#147;Sephardi&#148; and to speak Ladino, an ancient form of
Spanish. The fact is that no Sephardi communities existed other than those made up of the
immigrants from the Iberian Peninsula, their descendents or those who assimilated
themselves into Sephardi communities. European travelers and some Ashkenazi Jews have
referred, and still refer, mistakenly to all non-Ashkenazi Jews as Sephardi. This is
because the real Sephardi Jews established a lasting hegemony over other Jewish
communities. Many other than Sephardi, non-Ashkenazi members of Jewish communities have
more correctly defined themselves not only as Jews but also as Iraqis, Moroccans, Italians
or another nationality.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Until the end of the seventeenth century, Ashkenazi Jews constituted a
small minority of world Jewry. Their cultural advancement trailed far behind other Jewish
communities, especially the Sephardi and Italian. Since the eighteenth century, the
populations of Mediterranean countries, especially those in the Ottoman Empire, steadily
declined economically and demographically. This trend greatly affected Jewish communities
of those countries. Between 1700 and 1850, Jewish populations in these countries steeply
declined and became increasingly impoverished. The modest increase in Jewish population
between 1850 and 1914 did not to a significant extent offset the decline. From the
beginning of the eighteenth century the political and technological advancements in Europe
affected the Ashkenazi community. From the mid-eighteenth century the Ashkenazi population
began to increase rapidly; by 1800 Ashkenazi Jews had become the majority of world Jewry;
this increase and the majority percentage accelerated in the nineteenth century. Jews
living in the European part of the Russian Empire, nearly all of them Ashkenazi,
proliferated sevenfold between 1795 and 1914. Ashkenazi Jews developed a variety of
innovations in Judaism, some of them secularist. By the first half of the twentieth
century, Ashkenazi Jews had surpassed the relatively small, non-Ashkenazi minority in
every major respect, including Talmudic studies. The current split between religious
Ashkenazi Jews and non-Ashkenazi Jews sterns from the fact that during the past two
centuries, in contrast to what had previously been the case, almost all rabbis of
distinction have been Ashkenazi. In non-Athkenazi communities during this time period the
quality of talmudic study, of books published and even of older books being reprinted has
disastrously declined.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">Until 1948, Zionism and the emigration of Jews to Palestine were
predominantly Ashkenazi inventions. Most religious Jews viewed Zionism as being in
opposition to Judaism; hence, only Jews emancipated from their religious past could become
Zionists. Even so<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">, </font>few Ashkenazi
Jews immigrated to Palestine because of Zionist convictions. The great majority of those
who immigrated did so only because their lives were so difficult in their own countries of
origin. The great majority of Jews in Israel in 1948 were those who had immigrated to
Palestine after the increase in anti-Semitism in Europe after 1932 and especially after
Hitler came to power in Germany. The number of non-Ashkenazi Jews in Israel at the time of
the state's creation was relatively small. For most<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>Jews in non-Ashkenazi communities, the religious influence, especially
the messianic strain, was in the 1950s and early 1960s still potent. Living standards in
Israel in the 1950s, although below those throughout Europe, were superior to those in
most of<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>the Arab Middle East. The
Israeli government, therefore, could easily persuade Jews from many countries, for
example, Morocco, Yemen and Bulgaria, to immigrate to Israel. The Israeli government
induced Jewish immigration from Iraq by bribing the government<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2"> </font>of Iraq to strip most Iraqi Jews of
their citizenship and to confiscate their property. By contrast, few Jews immigrated to
Israel from the more advanced countries of the eastern Mediterranean, such as Greece or
Egypt. The majority of the Israeli Jewish population shifted to the non-Ashkenazi. During
the period from 1949 to 1965, Ashkenazi Jews in Israel declined to a minority that
stabilized at about 40 per cent of Israel's population. The substantial immigration of
Jews from the former Soviet Union thereafter increased the Ashkenazi population to about
55 per cent. By virtue of their having come from more advanced countries, the bulk of
Ashkenazi Jews were relatively modem in outlook and secular<font FACE="Traditional Arabic,Tahoma" SIZE="2">.</font></p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The non-Ashkenazi Jews, increasingly referred to as &#147;Orientals&#148;
instead of &#147;Sephardis,&#148; remained predominantly religious. Upon their arrival in
Israel many Oriental Jews and their children were put through a cultural socialization
directed by veteran Ashkenazi residents and advocated by members of the Zionist Labor
Party then in power. This socialization included a considerable amount of coercive
modernization and attempts to secularize the young. The results of this coercion were
mixed during most of the first two decades of Israel's existence. The majority of Oriental
Jews remained traditionalists meaning that these people ignored the more exacting
commandments of Judaism, such as the ban of Sabbath travel, but followed other
commandments, especially those dealing with synagogue attendance. Even more importantly,
it meant that they retained belief in the magical powers of rabbis and &quot;holy
men.&quot; To date, only a few Oriental politicians dare criticize a rabbi in public, even
when the rabbi strongly opposes or curses them. Ashkenazi Jews of all political views in
contrast criticize rabbis freely. Most Ashkenazi politicians despise any kowtowing to
rabbis. Almost all Oriental politicians, including the Black Panthers of the early 1970s
and the members of tiny Oriental peace movements, commonly bow to and kiss the hands of
rabbis in public.</p>

<p ALIGN="LEFT">The Ashkenazi religious minority, particularly its Haredi segment, has
resisted secularization of Oriental Jews. They have succeeded to some extent, most
particularly in persuading a minority to retain the strict observance of Judaism 's
commandments. They have established separate religious schools and yeshivot for the
Orientals and have admitted, although in strictly controlled numbers, some of the most
qualified Oriental youngsters to their own schools and yeshivas. After the passage of
time, an Oriental Haredi elite group of rabbis and talmudic scholars emerged in Israel.
Almost without exception, Ashkenazi Haredi rabbis trained members of this elite group.</p>
