Mediterranean Sea and the Dead Sea . Jerusalem is a holy city for the world's
major religions: Islam, and Christianity . In 1948 Jerusalem was under Israel
occupation (West Jerusalem) , and Jordan controlled the other part of Jerusalem
(East Jerusalem) including the Old City. In 1967 Israel occupied East Jerusalem
in the Six-Day War, Since then , both west and east Jerusalem has been under
Israeli occupation.<br>
