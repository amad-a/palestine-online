        <p><font face="Times New Roman">In elementary and middle school I had a few but very good
        friends. Two of them in particular were friends whom I knew not only in school, but also
        after school in our neighborhood and in their homes and in our home. Three of us, Ghassan,
        Maurice and I formed what we called a cultural club when we were 10 years old. During the
        week, at least two of the three members would do homework together in the home of one of
        us, have a snack, go out to play for a while and then at dusk each would go to his home
        which was only a few short blocks away. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Our weekend in those days was a split weekend; we went to
        school Monday through Thursday, were off on Friday, went back to school on Saturday and
        then took a day off again on Sunday. The idea behind this split weekend was so that both
        Moslems and Christians would have a day off on their respective day of the Sabbath, while
        the other day was an extra day off. Membership in our little cultural club was not based
        on any religion but the three of us happened to be Christian. So, our weekend
        get-togethers took place on Fridays since each of us wanted, and were required, to spend
        Sundays with our respective families. On Fridays we had a lot of time to read, exchange
        books and discuss the philosophy of life in general. The most popular publication in our
        club was an Arabic language weekly children's magazine published in Egypt under the title
        of Sindibad Al-Bahri (Sinbad the Sailor). Each one of us had a set of issues of Sindibad
        magazines and we looked forward to our weekend meetings to discuss the different feature
        stories and exchange different issues. We also read books in these meetings, sometimes
        reading the same book taking turns reading aloud while the others listened. Since the
        mother tong of each of the three of us was Arabic, we read Arabic books and publications
        in the beginning; but then we started to read in English those books which did not have
        Arabic translation, especially later as we were required to read in English for school.
        The three of us also contributed books to the club for use by any of the club members.
        Maurice and I did not contribute a lot of books to the club, but Ghassan was always
        bringing all kinds of books that we found very interesting. Some of the books which I
        remember from Ghassan's collection was Mother by Maksim Gorky and From the House of the
        Dead by Vyodor Destoyvsky. Most of the books which were contributed by Ghassan, we later
        realized, reflected his interest in Russia and the Communist Revolution. This interest was
        later to cause him a lot of grief with the authorities in Ramallah and later cause him
        continuous &quot;administrative&quot; detention by the Israeli authorities during the
        Israeli occupation of the West Bank. This chronic detention in jails administered by the
        Israeli authorities, and not fit for humans, caused Ghassan to fall ill and eventually die
        at a young age. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ghassan, Maurice and I all went to the same school, the
        National College otherwise known to many in Ramallah as the Abu Rayya School. It was my
        first exposure in Ramallah to a non-Catholic school. Although Abu Rayya was a
        &quot;private&quot; school, it was relatively inexpensive and its tuition was negotiable.
        The principal, who was an Arab American, used to make frequent visits to the United States
        and solicit donations for maintaining his school and for new community projects in
        Ramallah. Many of the students who attended his school did not pay any tuition, or paid a
        very small portion only, especially those who were judged by the principal as deserving a
        break, either because of their economic condition or because of their high intellect. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Besides Maurice and Ghassan, I had two other close friends
        in middle school; these were Vanto and Sari. Because of where they lived, however, Vanto
        and Sari did not hang out with the rest of my friends in my neighborhood. We usually went
        to the movies together and talked about these movies in school. Vanto always managed to
        keep our interest in Hollywood very high by bringing magazines with articles about movie
        stars, movies and upcoming Hollywood events. Vanto and Sari continued to be close friends
        until I changed schools one more time at the end of my elementary schooling. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One summer, three years after I started Abu Rayya School,
        my father heard that one of the best private secondary schools in the Middle East, which
        was located in Ramallah, was accepting Palestinian refugees and had an arrangement with
        the United Nations Relief Works Agency (UNRWA) for receiving a discounted tuition directly
        from them for such students. My father immediately enrolled me into the Friends Boys
        School in el-Bireh, Ramallah's twin city. I was not very excited about changing schools
        especially that I had to leave my friends behind in Abu Rayya, until I found out that
        Ghassan was also moving to the Friends. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><img src="images/domeoftherock1.jpg"
        width="240" height="214.5" alt="domeoftherock1.jpg (46596 bytes)"></font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">There were two Friends Schools in the Ramallah area, the
        Friends Boys School in el-Bireh and the Friends Girls School in Ramallah. According to the
        history records of the Ramallah City Hall, the Friends Girls School was established in
        Ramallah in 1889 and the Friends Boys School in el-Bireh in 1901. The two cities were side
        by side, one starting where the other ended, and most didn't know exactly where the
        dividing line was in most areas. Rashed Haddad, the father of the original Ramallah clans,
        came to Ramallah from the east Jordan Mountains of el-Shoubak, and settled in Ramallah in
        1550. The twin cities are about the same age, inhabited for hundreds and possibly for
        thousands of years. Actually the settling of Ramallah by Rashed Haddad and his descendants
        was the latest settling known. When I lived in Ramallah I used to go to places which we
        used to discover in the surrounding fields and mountains which seemed to have been
        inhabited in ancient times and which must have been abandoned for hundreds and perhaps
        thousands of years. Some of our family friends in Ramallah once took us to a field just
        outside Ramallah in what today is al-Tiereh neighborhood. In that field, in between the
        bushes and under the dirt and tree leaves, they uncovered a hole in the ground just barely
        large enough for a person to squeeze through. The hole had a hinged wooden cover on it
        that looked extremely old for the wood looked old and rotten. As we opened the door, we
        found a set of stairs, made of crudely arranged stones, leading down to a cave-like
        structure. We went down and saw a large area, which could hold about 50 people, all carved
        into the dirt and rocks with stones on the floor all around the walls of the structure
        arranged as benches, which must have been used for seating. At one end of the cave there
        was a large stone with flat smooth top standing in the middle of the end wall. There was
        evidence of oil and candle wax strewn all over the stone and all around the floor by the
        end wall. A simple wooden cross was hung on the wall over the stone. The cross was carved
        of olive tree wood and was smoothed, but only to a crude finish. The place must have been
        a church used by early Christians during the time when Christians were persecuted during
        one or another of the persecution campaigns in the first few centuries AD. Our friends
        jokingly explained that this was their find and considered it their hideaway church. One
        of the ladies told us how she liked to come to this 'church' alone sometimes and sit there
        and pray, with no one around and no light whatsoever except the light of the candles which
        she brought with her or kept there for future 'service'. There were many sites like this
        one that we occasionally stumbled on or were taken to by friends. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The twin cities of Ramallah and el-Bireh go way back when
        the area was last settled by two families (tribes or clans) around 1500, one Moslem family
        in el-Bireh and the other, Rashed Haddad and his bunch, a Christian family, in Ramallah.
        There were no Moslems living in Ramallah ever since Haddad settled the town, and perhaps
        never before. That continued until approximately 1967 when additional refugees left their
        hometowns and villages on the West Bank closer to the borders of Israel and moved into the
        area of Ramallah and el-Bireh. But until then, no Moslems had lived in the city of
        Ramallah. Similarly, no Christian families had lived in el-Bireh except the Rafeedi
        family. The Rafeedis were Christians but decided to settle in el-Bireh hundreds of years
        ago, but much later than 1500. Judging by their name, the Rafeedis probably came
        originally from Rafeedia, a small town near Nablus. When I lived in Ramallah, every Sunday
        morning one could time the clock by the sight of the entire Rafeedi family strolling down
        the el-Bireh street. They would cross the center of Ramallah, later built up as a fountain
        and called al-Manarah, down the Latin street and into the Latin (Catholic) church which
        was the site of my first elementary school in Ramallah. This must have continued for many
        years because el-Bireh had no churches and had no plans to build a church for just the one
        Rafeedi family. Conversely, Ramallah had no mosques and had no plans for the construction
        of such when no Moslems even lived in Ramallah in the fifties and until the mid 1960s.. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Israel then occupied the West Bank in 1967 and caused a
        change in the demography of Ramallah. Now there were many Moslems living in Ramallah and
        there were many Christians living in el-Bireh including the Rafeedi family. The Rafeedis
        worked hard on trying to convince the powers to be in el-Bireh to build a church there,
        now that the Rafeedis multiplied in numbers and had other Christians living in el-Bireh
        with them. But those powers won't budge. Finally, an opportunity presented itself to the
        Rafeedis. They learned that the Moslem population in Ramallah was requesting Ramallah's
        city council for a permit to build a mosque there. Rumors had it that the two cities got
        together and agreed that a mosque could be built in Ramallah and a church could be built
        in el-Bireh. That agreement unfortunately was not implemented, or simply implemented one
        way. As of this writing, there are approximately 15 mosques in Ramallah but not one church
        in el-Bireh. The Rafeedis and their Christian neighbors, who by now must be a large
        minority in el-Bireh if they are still there, still have to go down the el-Bireh street,
        crossing the center of Ramallah by al-Manarah, down the Latin street and into the Latin
        (Catholic) church which was the site of my first elementary school. </font></p>

        The two Friends schools, the boys school in el-Bireh and the girls school in Ramallah,
        were run by the Quaker missions from Richmond Indiana. The two schools were the most
        popular schools in the West Bank and East Jordan, and among expatriate Palestinian and
        Jordanian families who worked in other Arab countries. Because of this, and while I was
        attending the Friends Boys School, both schools had a large boarding population which kept
        the schools buzzing with activities all day long, well after classes were over. The
        faculty of both schools was mixed, some American volunteers who came from the U.S. on
        rotation assignments and some Arab and third country nationals, most of them graduates of
        American universities. </p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The Friends Boys School had two main focal personalities.
        The first was the Head Master or Principal of the school who traditionally was a U.S.
        person. The Head Master's job was rotational, changing incumbents every few years, and
        must have been easy because we, as students, had very little interaction with the Head
        Master and hardly saw him except during chapel assembly three mornings a week. My
        contemporaries were Dr. Reynolds and then Mr. Smuck. They were known for being
        disciplinarians but did not have the reputation of their predecessor Dr. Jones who, legend
        has it, kept a whip for those who were difficult to discipline. The legend of the whip
        continued on, well after Dr. Jones left. Although the effects of the legend of the whip
        faded with every passing year, that whip which none of my contemporaries ever saw
        continued to be a deterrent to those who may have otherwise contemplated acts unbecoming
        of a Friends student. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The second focal character was the Dean of the Friends
        Boys School, a job that was most powerful on campus because it was a permanent position
        and which interacted with students on more than one level. In addition to being the
        academic dean, the Friends Boys School Dean was a disciplinarian and a teacher. Our Dean
        was Mr. Farid Tabri, who at our time appeared to be, and upper classmen and alumni
        confirmed it, a permanent fixture of the Friends Boys School. When I arrived at the
        Friends, Mr. Tabri had been there almost thirty years and had been in the position of Dean
        for many years. No matter how much one can try to describe Mr. Tabri, words can never even
        start to describe him. It would be difficult to describe in words his serene personality,
        his loyalty to the school, his commitment to teaching and his admiration for those with
        whom he worked at the Friends. Mr. Tabri held special admiration for and often spoke very
        kindly of Dr. Totah who had been an Arab American benefactor and contributor to the
        school. It is easy for me now to remember Dr. Totah because Mr. Tabri had an oil painting
        of Dr. Totah hanging in the hallway outside his office. Under the picture was a chair
        which was specifically designated for trouble-students to sit in and wait to be called in
        to see Mr. Tabri whenever a student was sent to the dean by one or another of the teachers
        for discipline. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Tabri taught us Arabic and Arabic Literature, and was
        the most renowned authority on the Arabic language throughout the West Bank and East
        Jordan, and possibly beyond. He was also an expert on the Holy Koran, and had memorized
        it. He was an expert on the interpretation of the Holy Koran and Hadith (Tradition of the
        Prophet Muhammad), although he always refrained from making any such claims or from making
        religious interpretations deferring to those of the Moslem faith. He could recite every
        chapter and verse from the Holy Koran and always recited verses in support of his language
        teachings and explanations in the class. Mr. Tabri was a Palestinian Christian whose love
        for Islam and the Arabic language lead him to join the Al-Azhar University, the famous
        university in Cairo, Egypt, renowned for its specialty in Islam, Islamic Studies and the
        Arabic Language. Farid Tabri was accepted to Al-Azhar under the cover of Islam. He often
        told us that non-Moslems were not accepted to Al-Azhar because of its specialty subjects.
        Nonetheless, Farid Tabri got himself admitted to Al-Azhar in spite of the university's
        prohibition on the admission of Christians. In spite of his wealth of knowledge and
        expertise on the subject, Mr. Tabri was the most humble person I ever met. He used to tell
        us stories about his adventures while he was at Al-Azhar, but he never bragged or seemed
        to imply that he knew more about the subject than other teachers. His humility often led
        to some challenges from other faculty members who pretended to be experts on the Arabic
        language and put him in an awkward position with his students, because he did not like to
        tell us that another faculty member was 'wrong'. He quietly asked us to refer to earlier
        lessons and to verses from the Koran to bring his point across without ruffling anybody's
        feathers. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One of Mr. Tabri's unique teaching styles was his
        insistence that each of his students acquire and keep a standard pocket size notebook, or
        diary, in which the student must record any vocabulary or synonyms or explanations that
        Mr. Tabri would dictate, and he did that frequently. It was amazing how quickly we
        acquired and maintained that diary especially that most of his quizzes where from the
        notes he dictated to us and because of the dire consequences that he outlined for not
        maintaining the diary. When it was time, in his opinion, to clarify a matter in the Arabic
        language, he would say mufakkerah (diary), and in response every one in the class would
        have to lift his diary up high above his head to make sure every one had it before he
        started dictating. Those who did not have their diaries had to see him after class to
        explain and, when the explanation was not satisfactory as it usually was the case, to
        receive a lecture on that old whip of Dr. Jones or receive instructions for the
        appropriate detention. The diary was an excellent idea; we learned so much about the
        Arabic language, much more than students in other schools, especially about idioms that
        were commonly misused to mean one thing when in reality they meant the exact opposite. Mr.
        Tabri coordinated an Arabic poetry competition annually for the entire school, similar to
        the competitions that the al Jahiliyyah (pre Islam) Arabs held in Souk Okaz (the market of
        Okaz). </font></p>

        <p align="center"><small><small>Click on the image to enlarge</small></small></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Another of the highlights of Mr. Tabri's teaching
        activities was his ability to integrate the etiquette of visits and table manners, an
        activity which culminated in the annual dinner which he hosted for the graduating class at
        his home. Mr. Tabri used to enjoy watching and listening to his students imitate him and
        make fun of his teaching style during school gatherings. He had two lovely daughters who
        worked at the school and were prominent members of the school choir, were musically
        talented and contributed so much to the mornings chapel assemblies through piano concerts
        and recitals which made chapel much more pleasant and more bearable. Mr. Tabri also had a
        son in school who was one or two classes ahead of me and whom I knew very casually but did
        not see after he graduated. Thirty some years later, in the mid 80's as my family and I
        were returning to Dhahran from a vacation in the U.S. Virgin Islands through New York's
        JFK airport, we transited the then Pan Am terminal to connect with a Pan Am flight to
        Dhahran. As I handed the tickets and passports to the agent at the check-in counter, I got
        busy organizing my documents in my brief case. With my head in the briefcase I heard a
        voice ask, &quot;Are you the same Michael who attended the Friends Boys School in
        Ramallah?&quot; I couldn't believe my ears, nor could I believe my eyes when the agent
        introduced himself as Wadi' Tabri, the same son of Mr. Tabri whom I casually knew as the
        son of my great teacher and Dean at the Friends Boys School in Ramallah. Mr. Farid Tabri
        has since passed away but I know that his memory will always live on, in the minds and
        hearts of those Friends Boys School alumni who knew him. </font></p>

        <p align="center"><small><small>Click on the image to enlarge</small></small></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One other old timer among the faculty of the Friends in
        Ramallah was Mr. Khouri, another Christian Palestinian from Jiffna who always wore an Arab
        thobe. When I arrived at the Friends, he also had been there for a long time, possibly
        over thirty years. Mr. Khouri was a boarding teacher. He taught lower grades Arabic and
        Arab History and he taught me Religion (Bible) during my first year at the Friends. During
        the Religion period, our class was split into two groups, the Christians studied Bible
        with Mr. Khouri and the Moslems studied Koran with someone else. Mr. Khouri was one of
        those great teachers who would exaggerate and dwell considerably on a subject to bring a
        point across. I did not have much contact with Mr. Khouri except during Bible class, or
        when he substituted for another of our teachers, but that was enough to convince me that
        his was a no-nonsense teaching style and that he was a very capable and kind character. He
        called every one of his students with the Arabic adjective 'shater' (clever or good boy).
        Any one who would raise his hand in class was certain to get the standard response from
        Mr. Khouri &quot;Eish ya shater?&quot; which literally meant 'What is it, clever?' </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Adib Musallam, another of the great high school
        teachers of Palestine was one of those teachers who, I imagined, was following me wherever
        I went. He had taught me mathematics at Abu-Rayya, the National College, and as I was
        surprised to see my friend Ghassan at the Friends on the first day of school in September
        of 1954, I also discovered that Mr. Musallam was going to be my math teacher at the
        Friends. While I was not especially excited about Mr. Musallam's quizzes, finding a
        teacher whom I already knew was definitely a relief. Mr. Musallam had a very familiar and
        a very typical face, very comfortable to look at, one that would make a person wonder
        after seeing him for the first time 'where have I seen this face before?' He was a
        relaxed, kind teacher, the dream of every reasonably intelligent student, but he was a
        very firm disciplinarian, especially with a few trouble-students in class. Mr. Musallam
        had been teaching for so long, that there were very few families in Ramallah and its
        surrounding area who did not have one or another of its members having been taught at one
        time or another by Mr. Musallam. Most of his students at the Friends had family who had
        had Mr. Musallam for a teacher at one of the Ramallah area schools. Mr. Musallam knew his
        students by name and knew their relation to students whom he had taught in earlier years.
        He used only one threat in class when any of my classmates gave him a hard time:
        &quot;Wala, I taught your brother&quot;, Mr. Musallam would admonish the troublemaker. Or,
        he would say: &quot;Wala, I taught your mother&quot; or &quot;Wala, I taught your
        father.&quot; This was enough for the troublemaker to behave once and for all, for it was
        obvious that Mr. Musallam knew the nuclear secrets of that student and at least one other
        member of his family. Most of us in class imagined that all that Mr. Musallam had to do,
        to put us in our place, was simply send a message to our relatives whom he had taught in
        earlier years and complain about our behavior. That was deterrent enough to stop us from
        committing any mischief in his class. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Nevertheless, there was one students who always seemed to
        get in trouble with Mr. Musallam and irritate him; that was Makram, who had no clue what
        math was all about and was not about to have anyone, let alone Mr. Musallam, pull a fast
        one and change that. With Makram, when it came to math, ignorance was bliss and he wanted
        that to stand. Makram used to always carry a tennis racket with his books, although he
        played tennis infrequently; in class one was always under his desk with the books. Because
        he was bored during math class, he would pick up the racket and pretend it was a guitar
        that he would pretend playing while Mr. Musallam was writing on the board. Makram would
        get in trouble when Mr. Musallam would turn around quickly to make a point, and would get
        extremely irritated to see Makram playing around. During one of his tests, Mr. Musallam
        was careful about what to expect from Makram. After he gave out the test sheets, Mr.
        Musallam faced the class for the first few minutes then he walked over to the bookcase
        that was next to the chalkboard. We thought he was looking at the titles in the
        glass-covered case with his back to the class. Soon enough, and before he even turned
        around, Mr. Musallam called on Makram: &quot;Wala, Ana shayfak minelazaz.&quot; Which
        meant, 'I can see you in the glass'. Makram was in trouble for he was caught asking his
        neighbor to let him cheat.</font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Musallam was an excellent math teacher. He took his
        teaching job seriously, used to come to class prepared, and was always willing and ready
        to demonstrate how to construct geometrical figures and would be carrying all kind of
        tools, colored chalk and pieces of string. Everything I learned about math, in high school
        and in college, I owe to Mr. Musallam. He is one whose children I came to know well later
        especially the kind Diana and the pleasant Nabil. He is one of those teachers whom I and
        my classmates will never forget. </font></p>

        <p align="center"><small><small>Click on the image to enlarge</small></small></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">One day, I think it was during one of Mr. Musallam's
        classes while he was going through the proof of Pythagorean theorem, there was a knock on
        the door. The class was in the building adjacent to the auditorium and the classroom door
        had a small glass window in the middle of the door. Most of us who were politically aware
        could recognize just outside the door two infamous mabaheth (detectives) who were very
        well known and despised by the students in Ramallah; both of them were natives of two
        villages outside the city. The school secretary was with them. She came in, whispered in
        Mr. Musallam's ears and he called for Ghassan, my friend and my colleague in our little
        cultural club. Ghassan got up, went with the school secretary and walked out the door to
        be hand cuffed and led away to jail. That incident had the most sobering effect on most of
        us students who were politically active in school and outside school. It made us realize
        that political activity came with a price and those who were not willing to pay that price
        had better stop their games. It was the last time I was in class with Ghassan. Although he
        came out of jail a few years later, he spent a considerable part of his life in jail
        accused of being a communist. If he was tried, it must have been in one of those kangaroo
        courts where one would have no chance if accused of political activities &quot;contrary to
        the national interest&quot; with the &quot;intent of demeaning the government.&quot; </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Ghassan's arrest was a typical abuse of political activism
        and individual liberties, not only by the Jordanian government, but also by most
        governments of the Middle East. Like most students in the West Bank during the 1950s,
        Ghassan had beliefs and opinions that did not necessarily conform to those held by the
        ruling class. When he was arrested, he was a political prisoner. He was not a criminal. He
        did not carry weapons, he did not plant bombs nor was he involved in any physical activity
        that caused or threatened any physical harm to the life, health or property of any
        individual or group. All students, and most of the population, believed that their
        government at that time was going in the wrong direction. There were no civil liberties,
        there was no respect for human rights, and there was no sharing of governance by
        legitimate representatives of the people. The Parliament, which at that time was a joke,
        had been suspended and martial law had been declared, as this had been the government's
        escape whenever it encountered heavy political opposition and the people demanded
        political reform. Political parties were banned in their infancy and as soon as they
        appeared to threaten the ruling few. Public gatherings (gatherings of three or more
        individuals) were banned for they formed a threat to those who were in control. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The relation between the government and the people was
        adversarial, one of &quot;them versus us&quot;. The secret police, generally referred to
        throughout the Arab World as the 'mabaheth' or the 'mukhabarat', were in control of the
        streets. They knew everything that was going on and everyone that was doing it. They often
        arrested a person because he or she was suspected of &quot;subversive&quot; activities.
        Those who were in power defined what constituted subversive activities. For them,
        subversion consisted of every activity that even remotely resembled any expression of
        dissatisfaction with the present rule or appeared, in the minds of the mukhabarat, to
        threaten the governance of those who were in power. The mass media was controlled by the
        ruling power. What was transmitted to the eyes and ears of the public was shaped by the
        interest of the government. Hence, the distribution of leaflets, by political activists,
        that quoted international news media regarding events in Jordan was at that time labeled
        as subversive. The distribution of leaflets analyzing the governments stand or action on
        certain issues of interest to the public was &quot;subversive activity&quot;. The desire
        by any one or group to share in the governance was interpreted by those in power as a
        threat to their power and a challenge to their authority. They knew that if they shared
        their power of governance, they would stand the chance of loosing their power. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The governments of the Arab World in the 1950s fought the
        &quot;subversive activities&quot; with the power of the secret police and the military,
        instead of fighting it with ideas and information, because they knew their control of the
        people was not legitimate and the truth was their enemy. As the governments cracked down
        more on the protests of dissatisfaction, the people got angrier and angrier and peaceful
        protests turned into mass hysteria. I will not forget the protest marches and
        demonstrations that were organized in Ramallah, Jerusalem, Nablus, and other West Bank
        cities when I was in high school. I will not forget one demonstration that I found myself
        leading from the Friends Boys School to the town center to meet other marches that had
        been started in other parts of the town and which converged on al-Manarah, the town
        center. As the demonstration got bigger and bigger, it got out of hand and turned into
        chaos and anarchy in spite of all good and peaceful intentions. As part of the
        demonstration arrived a building that had been rented by the US Information Service and
        converted to an 'American Library', the protest march got totally out of hand. Bands of
        the demonstrators attacked the building, snatched all of the books, bookshelves and other
        furniture, piled them up outside the building and torched them to express their
        dissatisfaction with the support of the United States to those who were in power and their
        dictatorial powers under the monarchy. I also remember the curfews that were imposed
        immediately thereafter and the troops, the Bedouin forces of the Arab Legion of the
        Jordanian Army, and the army tanks that occupied the town center. There were lives that
        were lost; there were lives that were destroyed, there were families that lost their
        breadwinners for years and there were more children made street beggars. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">As a political prisoner, Ghassan was quickly whisked away
        to far away jails in the eastern desert and no one could dare communicate with him lest
        that person fall under suspicion, by the authorities, of being &quot;subversive&quot;
        also. Arab rulers and Arab governments in the 1950s had absolute power over the people and
        were determined to keep that power. Unfortunately, little has changed in most of the Arab
        World, and what little now seems to be changing is changing in the wrong direction. As
        more and more Arab rulers remain in power for decades, they are afforded the opportunity
        to change the individual dictatorships and one-party rules into dictatorial dynasties and
        perpetual one-party dictatorships. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Mr. Musallam taught me for two years and then I had
        different math teachers in upper classes. After I left the Friends in 1958 I did not see
        Mr. Musallam until 1971 in Detroit, when he was visiting his son Nabil and his daughter,
        Diana, who lived there. For me it was a very emotional re-union. </font></p>
        <p align="center"><font face="Times New Roman"><a href="images/ramallahfriends4.jpg"><img

        <p align="center"><small><small>Click on the image to enlarge</small></small></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the time I attended the Friends, there were even some
        third country nationals who were teaching there as their presence in Palestine was in
        connection with the UNRWA. One such example was Dr. T. John, an Indian national who was in
        Ramallah with his wife; she was a medical doctor on the medical staff of UNRWA overlooking
        the health of the public at the refugee camp in Jalazoun. I can remember Dr. John's face
        very clearly as if I saw him yesterday; he had dark colored skin typical of the natives of
        southern India and islands of the Indian Ocean. His eyes had dark pupils with very white
        whites; he had round face, his nose was small with a flat tip, probably because he liked
        to rub it with the palm of his hand while he spoke. He had wavy hair, straight and upright
        posture and wore very baggy pants which I later came to realize, as later in my life I
        became acquainted in the Arabian Peninsula with many Indians, was typical of Indian dress
        habits. He always wore long sleeve shirts with the sleeves kept high on his arms with
        metal elastic bands around his biceps. Occasionally he wore a jacket or a sweater over his
        shirt but never a tie. Dr. John, if I remember correctly, had a doctorate degree in
        history and a doctorate degree in divinity, at least one of them from Colombia. He was a
        wealth of knowledge for us at the Friends Boys School. He taught me for four years, and if
        I had to listen to him teach me many more years, I would have never been bored of the
        things he had to teach or the stories he had up his baggy sleeves. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. John taught me the history of ancient civilizations,
        the history of the Roman Empire, the history of the Holy Roman Empire and the history of
        the Unification of Italy and Germany. When he spoke, he was so interesting and
        enlightening, one could hear a pin drop in the class for he captured everyone's
        imagination. Dr. John also taught me religion, which in his class was the great religions
        of the world, and taught me about the great personalities of history. He not only taught
        us about Buddhism, Hinduism, Confucianism and other religions and reform movements, but he
        also taught us about the great personalities of history, human rights activists and great
        scientists and inventors. He taught us about Jesus Christ, Buddha, Muhammad, Toyohiko
        Kagawa, Booker T Washington, Confucius, Abraham Lincoln, Mahatma Ghandi, Benjamin Franklin
        and many others whom he admired and magically transferred that admiration into our minds
        and hearts. With his persuasive presentations, low-key manner of speech and the typical
        Indian movements of his hands and his head, he made us share his admiration for, and fall
        in love with the acts of, each of his heroes whom we by now have adopted as our own. He
        taught us how an emperor walked for miles, in the snow, and knelt on his knees in front of
        the Pope to ask for forgiveness. He taught us how Garibaldi, humble as his start may have
        been, worked against insurmountable odds to unite a divided Italy after years and years of
        intra national bickering and infighting. He taught us how in his country, Mother India,
        passive as they may have been ,the people of India were still able to resist the British
        arrogance, prejudice and occupation with passive resistance under the leadership of
        Mahatma Ghandi. He taught us about the American Revolution, the Declaration of
        Independence and the framers of the American Constitution. He taught us about many people
        and many things that left an effect and an impression on us that are not likely to wear
        off till the day some of us die. He taught us to speak freely, never to be afraid of
        consequences of the truth. It was his teachings coupled with the political events of the
        time in the Arab World that shaped my awareness of my surroundings, social and political.
        Dr. T. John was my inspiration to rebel, as many in the Arab world did, against social
        injustice, the absence of civil liberties and the arrogance of those in power. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. John's teachings reinforced my feelings about and
        awareness of the incompetence of those who were in power and their disregard for decency.
        Why couldn't they be like Thomas Jefferson? Why couldn't they be like Mahatma Ghandi? Why
        couldn't they act like Benjamin Franklin? Why couldn't they believe in the principles
        taught by Confucius, the humility taught by Buddha, the forgiveness taught by Christ, and
        the tolerance taught by Mohammad. Why did they pretend to know it all and insist on
        telling me, and others like me among the people, that they knew better than the writer or
        the poet, the carpenter or the blacksmith, the banker or the broker, the laborer or the
        farmer? It was Dr. John's teachings that made me feel obligated to do something, anything,
        about the society in which I lived and the state of affairs that existed at that time.
        Like most people, I could feel that there was something wrong with what was going on in
        that place I called home, something terribly wrong, where the instruments of the governing
        few were abuse and more abuse of the rights of the many, and absolute disregard for the
        rights of the individual. I could feel there was something wrong when units of the army
        roamed the streets to put down peaceful demonstrations. I could feel there was something
        wrong when tanks rolled down the streets into Al-Manarah, the town square, to stop the
        peaceful and passive resistance. I could feel there was something wrong when members of
        the mabaheth sneaked up under the cover of darkness and hid from sight under the windows
        of peaceful families to eavesdrop and listen in to what was going on in these homes. The
        mabaheth picked up, detained and interrogated anyone who was caught tuned in to
        Sout-el-Arab, &quot;Voice of the Arabs&quot; radio broadcast from Cairo. Anyone who tuned
        in to that radio station was assumed to be a troublemaker who should be detained. I could
        see that there was something wrong when I saw the instruments of oppression pick up my
        friend Ghassan from school because of his political beliefs. I could feel there was
        something wrong when I saw soldiers fix their bayonets to their rifles in the streets of
        Ramallah, as a sign of readiness to quell peaceful gatherings. But I could also feel there
        was something wrong when the remedies sought by many of us turned into ugly hysteria,
        confrontations, and anarchy. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Everything that Dr. John taught in class seemed to enforce
        my feelings that there was something wrong because every principle he taught seemed to be
        violated constantly by my country's government and its agents. The teachings of Dr. John
        reinforced my feelings that everything good that was supposed to be happening to my people
        was, for some reason, not happening to me or to my people. I convinced myself, and I was
        out to convince anyone I could, that that reason was the government and its policies and
        its instruments of oppression. Dr. John's teachings inspired me to participate in, and
        sometimes lead, peaceful demonstrations. His teachings inspired me to be an activist, to
        organize peaceful opposition and to disseminate information that the people had been
        denied. His teachings inspired me to join in the secret distribution of political leaflets
        in the vegetable market of Ramallah, in the painting of anti-government political slogans
        on public buildings in the middle of the night and defying the ban on public gatherings. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Dr. T. John's teachings also reinforced my feeling about
        religious harmony among the various religions of the world. He taught compassion for those
        who did not have the same beliefs as we did, and emphasized tolerance to those beliefs
        that differed from our beliefs. His teachings reinforced my tolerance, as a Christian, to
        other peoples and religions especially Moslems and Islam, the only other people and faith
        with whom I had daily contact. It also reinforced my tolerance, as a Christian, to Jews
        and Judaism in spite of the suffering that was inflicted upon me as a Palestinian by
        people who were Jews. I had learned tolerance from my father, whose three closest friends
        were three Jewish brothers. He always taught me that Jews did not mean any harm to
        Palestinians, no more than Christians meant any harm to Jews in Europe. My father used to
        say, &quot;It was the Nazis who caused the aggravation and grief for the Jews in Europe,
        and it was the Zionists who caused us our grief as Palestinians. Only a small uninformed
        group on either side look at these conflicts as conflicts of religions.&quot; I had
        learned, during the years of my growing up in Palestine, and especially in Ramallah, that
        I could and should be proud to be a Christian Arab and that no one ever had the right to
        question my belief. I also learned, and Dr. John's teachings reinforced that, that I could
        be proud of my Arab culture that was shaped by Islam. I definitely was. I was proud to
        have Christianity as a faith that established my relation with my creator, and have Islam
        as a cultural background that established my relations with Arab history and culture. I
        felt I was more fortunate than non-Arab Christians, and more fortunate than Arab Moslems.
        I felt that I was fortunate to have had the best of both worlds. I will never forget Dr.
        John for all that he taught my schoolmates and me at the Friends Boys School. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Among the Friends Boys School teachers I also remember the
        science teachers, specifically Mr. Fouad Zaru who taught Chemistry at the two Friends
        Schools in Ramallah, and who much later, after I left the Friends, became the school
        principal. Another Mr. Khouri who taught me at the Friends was Mu'een Khouri who was a
        mentor and a political activist in the Baath Party, and was always present at most of the
        Party functions which I attended, especially protests and demonstrations. But most fondly
        I remember those young Palestinian teachers who had just completed their education in the
        United States and returned home to teach at the Friends. One I will always remember is Mr.
        Badee' Nijim. My classmates will definitely remember Mr. Nijim because he was light
        hearted in teaching and because of the examples that he used to cite, and the stories that
        he used to tell in class. He taught us European History, from the collapse of the Roman
        Empire to Napoleon. He brought to class many examples of the corruption and decadence of
        the Roman emperors and their wives. One particular example that we used to like him to
        tell us repeatedly was the stories about the wife of Emperor Claudius. He told us stories
        of her sexual adventures and how she used to challenge young Roman army generals into sex
        marathons in the age of decadence in which she lived. He used to know that we, at the age
        of 15 and 16 used to like that stuff and he took advantage of that fact to exaggerate and
        bring his points across his young audience. I was destined to meet Mr. Nijim again later
        in my life, this time in Saudi Arabia, and we both laughed when I reminded him of his
        European History stories. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">The two Friends Schools were completely segregated except
        on certain days of the week when we had a common chapel or on special occasions. The girls
        came to visit the boy's school during special athletic events, when outside speakers were
        invited or during common holiday festivities such as during the Christmas pageant.
        Students came to the Friends from all parts of the West Bank and East Jordan and some came
        from many countries of the world. When I was at the Friends Boys School, we had students
        from the UK, USA, Iraq, Lebanon and, I am sure most of my contemporaries would remember,
        one student who came from Ethiopia. The Friends school atmosphere was calm, the local and
        foreign faculty was nice and friendly and the students were all easy to know that it took
        me only a short while to feel at home there. Also, the walk to school in the morning from
        my home to the Friends was much more pleasant than the walk to Abu Rayya. The walk to the
        Friends took me to areas very close to many girls' schools and it was nice to see smiling
        pretty faces in the morning. From my home I could take one of two different roads, which
        then converged by the main movie theater on Main Street, which then was a straight shot
        all the way to el-Bireh and the Friends Boys School. The first road took me up the Friends
        Hill that went right by the Friends Girls School. Going that route I could see most of the
        Friends' girls going to school in the morning and that was nice especially that there were
        a few of them I liked, some of them a lot. The other route took me up through the
        vegetable market by the Greek Orthodox Church, up a narrow street where my friend Jalal
        worked in his father's bakery. Jalal sometimes would join me the rest of the way. We would
        then go up the Latin Street by al Ahliyyah School and close by the girls' school of St.
        Joseph. Up at the top of the hill was one of the Jerusalem bus stops where many of the
        students arriving from Jerusalem or some of the surrounding villages would start their
        walk to their schools. The walk up that route was just as pleasant for I could see most of
        the St. Joseph School girls walking to their school, most of them were good looking and
        especially few were knock outs. It was a great pleasure at that age to be able to exchange
        glances and, if one is bold enough, to pass notes back and forth. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">It was during my years at the Friends Boys School that I
        learned to love and dream about America. The school activities and the interaction with
        the faculty and staff, many of whom were Americans, made me interested in the United
        States. Some of us who were politically active would sometimes challenge the American
        faculty members to an informal debate about the 'imperialist ambitions' of the United
        States in the Middle East and about the role of the superpowers and democracy. Many of us
        had mixed feelings about the United States of America. On the one hand, it was a country
        of those who revolted against British colonialism, the country of the American Revolution
        against the oppression of the British. That history in itself was enough for me and many
        of my friends to establish a bond. The Palestinians suffered the consequences of the
        Ottoman, then the British, colonial rule in Palestine and developed a feeling of mistrust,
        and hate for the colonial power's deceit and duplicity. That common grievance with the
        Americans against the British gave me the feeling of comfort in talking to and dealing
        with Americans. Then there was the American Constitution and the Declaration of
        Independence, and what they stood for in terms of the liberties and the individual's
        rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. We quickly learned that the United
        States was protecting some of the Arab rulers out of political expediency and not because
        the Americans sanctioned dictatorship, but we never accepted that as legitimate. We
        learned from our American teachers, although we did not accept the argument, that America
        in many instances had no choice but to support such dictatorships in spite of their abuse
        of civil liberties and human rights. That was something we could not understand in those
        days, and many of us have never able to understand until this very day. We questioned our
        American teachers about the unqualified support and protection, which their country gave
        to the Zionists, those who took our country and our homes and made refugees out of us.
        That, they could not defend; they could only cite that the American public opinion was
        shaped by the influence of the pro-Israel lobby. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">During the last two years at the Friends, most students
        were talking about what they would do after school and where they would go next. Among the
        well to do students, the American University of Beirut (AUB) was a very popular, though
        expensive, choice. Among those who were not so well to do, the United States was top
        choice because, as most American teachers would tell us at that time, after the first year
        of college there the student could work and be able to make a living while going to
        school. But even that was out of the question for many of us, for we had to have the means
        to get there and survive for one year first. Outside the conversation on education, it
        seemed that every conversation among the students was centered on the United States. Even
        those who were planning, and could afford, to go the American University of Beirut, were
        talking about their dreams of eventually going to the United States to live there in the
        American heaven on earth as portrayed by the Hollywood images of the 1950s. I wanted so
        badly to go to college in the U.S. but I knew I could never afford it. Although my father
        by now was doing well enough to provide for a family of ten, and educate all of his
        children through high school, he could never afford the tremendous financial burden of
        travel and college tuition and other expenses for a whole year. I was told in no uncertain
        terms that we could not afford to have me go to school in the United States. My dreams
        about travel to America were squashed by financial reality. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">After I graduated from the Friends Boys School, I didn't
        know what to do. Jobs for high school graduates were very limited and the pay was hardly
        enough to cover pocket expenses. I worked for my father in the machine shop for a while
        and then I saw many of my friends from school leave the country. Many of them went on to
        college at the AUB or in the United States, Egypt or even Turkey, assisted by their
        parents or by some scholarship which required grades much better than I had. Others left
        the country in search of work in other parts of the Arab world, especially the oil rich
        countries of the Arabian Peninsula. I was itching to leave too, and it was not long after
        that, that I too left. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">At the prodding of a German customer of my father, I
        decided to go to Germany to learn German, work and go to college. That was the first
        failure of my life, which cost me one year of wasted time. As I arrived in Germany and
        enrolled into the Goethe Language Institute in Murnau, right outside Munich, I started to
        communicate with German colleges. They promptly and politely advised me that there was
        approximately two years waiting time for admission of foreign students, and politely
        recommended that I enroll into some work-study program in the field of my aspiration until
        I could be admitted, a very time consuming proposition. I very enthusiastically took their
        advice, and as soon as I completed the language course, approximately ten weeks after I
        arrived from home, I went to Wiesbaden and worked in a factory that made mechanical
        handling systems. The pay was good enough to cover my expenses but I did not stay there
        long. I realized, after soul searching, that my admission into college even after two
        years was not guaranteed and it was conceivable that I could stay there working in the
        factory for two years, simply to find out that admission was not possible. Actually, some
        of my colleagues who were in the same situation ended up working without going to college
        until they left Germany several years later, some of them to Austria but most of them to
        the United States. After about six months from the time I left home, I returned with the
        agony of defeat, and back to square one. I stayed in Ramallah for a few months pondering
        the situation and in the summer of that year (1959) I decided to go look for educational
        opportunities in Damascus, Syria. There, I quickly found out that Syrian universities were
        overcrowded with a long waiting list and most of their high school graduates who wanted to
        continue their education had to go elsewhere. While in Damascus, I stayed with some
        friends at the office-and-guest-house of the Baath Arab Socialist Party (of Jordan) for
        two months. When I gave up on educational opportunities in Damascus, I left to Beirut in
        search of the same opportunities, which until then had eluded me. While in Beirut, I met
        one of my classmates from the Friends Boys School who had heard about an American junior
        college, run by Armenian Americans, which was giving scholarships to Palestinians. I
        immediately went to Haigazian College and applied for admission and for financial aid. I
        was asked to take an entrance exam, which I took and passed, and based on my transcript
        from the Friends and the results of the entrance exam, I was admitted for immediate
        enrollment. Based on the fact that I was a Palestinian refugee, my admission was with full
        financial aid. As I had no place to stay, and because the college was not in session yet,
        Haigazian staff arranged for me to stay, free of charge, at the home of one of the
        Armenian families in Al-Hamra district within a few blocks from the college. I stayed
        there for a couple of weeks until school started at which time I moved into the Haigazian
        dorms in a brand new building. </font></p>

        <p><font face="Times New Roman">My Beirut experience was enjoyable and very rewarding and
        I very much appreciated the opportunity, which I felt was God sent. When Haigazian opened
        its doors, I found out that I was among ten or so students from the Jerusalem/Ramallah
        area, a few of them I had already met back home. Also, my Friends connection came into
        play, for there was one other Friends graduate at Haigazian and were many Friends students
        attending the AUB, just a few blocks down the road from Haigazian. Two of the students who
        were closest to me in Beirut were Isa, a classmate from the Friends, and Munir who was
        another friend from Ramallah and was rooming with Isa. I knew that if I were to continue
        my education after Haigazian, I had to be serious about school and study hard. I knew that
        meant that I should de-emphasize my involvement in politics and emphasize my focus on
        getting good grades. That I did, although it was difficult for me to distance myself from
        politics, at least temporarily. I was so obsessed with getting good grades that I studied
        most of the time and had little free time for anything else. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Based on my placement exam, I was placed in College
        Physics, English, Philosophy and Remedial Math. I was very upset about the Remedial Math
        and felt that I should have been in Calculus. I went to the chairman of the Math
        Department, who was teaching Calculus, and pleaded with him to move me into Calculus. I
        explained that I had left high school a whole year earlier and was somewhat rusty on my
        math. He told me that the results of my entrance exam indicated that I belonged in
        Remedial Math as a step before Calculus, and the fact that I was rusty proved that.
        However, he continued on to explain, if I were to do very well on another exam that was to
        be given at the end of the week in remedial math, and prove that I 'was the star' of my
        math class, then I could be moved to Calculus. I started to review my math by getting
        books from the library and practicing various college algebra problems. I must have
        practiced on several hundred problems by exam time at the end of the week. I took the exam
        on Friday morning and felt good about it. On Monday morning, the second Monday of the
        school year, the two math teachers called me in for a joint meeting with both of them, and
        I was moved into Calculus, because I had a perfect score on my exam. That action gave me
        the confidence that I needed to do well while at Haigazian. I worked hard in all of my
        classes, especially in Physics. Anise, a fellow Palestinian student from Qalqilyeh, whom I
        met upon my arrival in Haigazian, went complaining to some of my friends that I was
        studying too hard. He was concerned that I may have emotional problems because he felt
        that I was spending too much time thinking and gazing at a ruler during study hour, and
        that he was worried about me. When some of my friends confronted me, I had to explain to
        them that I was not flipping from too much studying, and that I was not gazing at a ruler
        in study hall. The &quot;ruler&quot; Anise was talking about was actually my slide rule,
        which I used in solving my physics problems. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">I also knew that I had to keep my focus on the United
        States. My rationale was as follows: Haigazian was essentially a two year college after
        which I had two choices, either go to the AUB which I could not afford, or go to the
        United States and earn a living while I was going to school. I studied hard at Haigazian
        and completed the year successfully. I am grateful to Haigazian and the Armenian American
        community who supported the school. I owe them my fruitful year in Beirut for they were
        responsible for my having been able to gain the confidence to go to the United States of
        America where I studied, worked and earned my engineering degrees. </font></p>
        <p><font face="Times New Roman">Right next to Haigazian, separated by a hurricane fence,
        was the Armenian Evangelical School, an Armenian high school. Little did I know that the
        love of my life, whom destiny would have me meet many years later, was attending that
        school. </font></p>
