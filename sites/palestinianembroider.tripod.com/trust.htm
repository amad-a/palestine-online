            <p><strong><font face="Arial" size="2">The Ladah Foundation was formed on April 20, 1999
            as a Trust granted by Michael S. Ladah and Khatoun (Hilda) Ladah. </font></strong></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The primary objective of the Ladah Foundation has
            been to provide charitable support and assistance in the form of scholarships to needy and
            deserving students.&nbsp; The Ladah Foundation will also provide humanitarian assistance
            in the form of food and shelter to homeless and needy individuals and families, and
            medical assistance to individuals and families in need of assistance judged essential to
            their needs and the absence of which will be detrimental to their welfare.&nbsp; The Ladah
            Foundation may also provide contributions in the form of monetary assistance and other
            support to charitable, non-profit institutions such as orphanages, homes for the
            handicapped and institutions assisting battered women or abused children.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The intended beneficiaries of the charity provided
            by the Ladah Foundation will be refugees of war, victims of civil strife, and victims of
            present and past state and/or other discrimination.&nbsp; This includes individuals or
            families who are suffering the consequences of such victimization and meet the criteria
            for need described above.&nbsp; The specific population which is the target of the charity
            provided by the Ladah Foundation may change from time to time, while the criteria for need
            of assistance will remain as specified in the Trust document and briefly described above. </strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Ladah Foundation will announce the availability
            of its charitable assistance, and solicit applications from beneficiaries who can meet its
            criteria for need, among populations specifically targeted for assistance as intended by
            the Foundation.&nbsp; Certain Non-Government Organizations (NGOs) operating in various
            areas will also be contacted and requested to advertise the charity of the Ladah
            Foundation through the NGOs' field offices.&nbsp; Certain colleges and universities will
            also be contacted to assist in the identification of prospective scholarship award
            recipients.&nbsp; The Ladah Foundation also plans to describe its mission, charities and
            its targeted beneficiary population through this web site.</strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The Grantors of the Trust, Michael S. Ladah and
            Hilda Ladah, have allocated an interim contribution with the intent to fund the
            organizing, planning and controlling of the activities of the Ladah Foundation and start
            the implementation of its objectives.&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the interim phase is to
            insure that the funds will be used by the Trustees to meet the objectives of the
            Foundation as they are now intended and will have been intended by the Grantors for years
            to come. </strong></font></p>
            <p><font face="Arial" size="2"><strong>The activities of the Ladah Foundation will be
            conducted in the United States and will be managed by the Trustees.&nbsp; However,
            beneficiaries of the charitable assistance may be located anywhere in the world.&nbsp; The
            Ladah Foundation's bank accounts, securities and/or other investments will normally be
            held in and through United States financial institutions.&nbsp; Foreign sub-accounts may
            be established from time to time, but only if necessary for the conduct of the
            Foundation's operations (distribution of its charities) outside the United States.</strong></font></p>

            Foundation will conduct any public campaign for the solicitation of funds from the public.
