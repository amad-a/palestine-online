<P><CENTER><FONT SIZE=5>150 palestinian and international students attacked<BR>at launch of gaza students campaign 1998</FONT></CENTER></P>

<BR>

<P><I>Birzeit</I>—Israeli police today broke up a peaceful march held by 150 Palestinian and
international students at al-Ram checkpoint outside Jerusalem. The group
marched calling for academic freedom for Gaza students. Two Palestinian
students were arrested. </P>


<P>The march was joined by Dr Hanan Ashrawi and Dr Gabi Baramki, advisor to
the Palestinian Ministry of Higher Education. Both addressed the crowd
calling for the right to education and freedom of movement for students
from Gaza who wish to study in the West Bank.</P>



<P>Today's march for academic freedom marks the launch of a campaign
organized to assert the right of Gaza students to study at the university
of their choice. It culminates in an international day of action on 19
November 1998.</P>



<P>Gaza students' right to education in West Bank Universities is denied by
the Israeli authorities. Approximately 600 students from Gaza are
currently living 'illegally' in the West Bank, denied permission by the
Israeli administration to reside or study in the West Bank.</P>



<P>The two Palestinians who were arrested during the peaceful march were
released within two hours.  Both are students at Birzeit University, aged
19 and 20.  Israeli border police also attempted to arrest a number of
internationals. Several international and Palestinian protesters were
injured.</P>



<P>Supporters from 18 countries waved their national flags and held up
placards calling for Israel to respect education as a fundamental human
right. The students came from Australia, Canada, Chile, Cyprus, Denmark,
Finland, France, Germany, Israel, Jordan, the Netherlands, Norway,
Palestine, Pakistan, Singapore, Sweden, UK and USA.</P>

Officer at the address below. For further information and coverage of the March for Academic Freedom, visit the <A HREF="/bzunews/1998/Aug/22.html">Birzeit News</A> section of the Birzeit University website.</P>


<P><I>The Gaza Students Campaign is an international non-political 
campaign for academic freedom initiated in 1996.</I></P>
