<P>"The refusal of the Israeli government to allow Gaza students to study in
the West Bank is a denial of the right to academic freedom. This collective
punishment only increases the despair among young Palestinians and only
damages chances for peace," said Rev. Duncan Macpherson, Friends of Birzeit
University (FoBZU) chair.</P>

<P>A FoBZU delegation presented a petition with around 5000 signatures to Mr
Shalom Tourgeman, the Israeli Embassy Public Affairs Counsellor this
morning. The petition calls on the Israeli government "to guarantee complete
academic freedom for the students, teachers and staff of Gaza who work and
study in the West Bank" and in particular, for Israel "to introduce academic
permits and a standardised, open system of procedure for dealing with
applications".</P>

<P>Mr Tourgeman said that the Israeli government was aware of  international
pressure on this issue, and that 100 permits for Gazan students to travel to
the West Bank to study had been issued in January 1998. The delegation
informed him that 19 of the 100 names were refused permits by the Israeli
authorities, that the 81 permits granted do not cover the full academic
semester, and that the male students are still facing difficulties in
obtaining their permits. Mr Tourgeman envisaged that these 81 permits would
be renewed and that more permits would be issued in the future.</P>

<P>No progress has been made on the "safe passage" between the West Bank and
Gaza, which was included in the Israeli-PLO peace accords, due to Israeli
security concerns. Mr Tourgeman said the Israel considers Palestinians aged
18-25 as a "dangerous group". The delegation stressed that the vast majority
of Gaza students are not a security risk and therefore should not be
subjected to this collective punishment. It suggested that the issue of
permits should be dealt with on an individual rather than a collective basis. 
</P>

<P>The international Gaza Student Campaign will be handing petitions into
Israeli Embassies in ten countries.</P>
