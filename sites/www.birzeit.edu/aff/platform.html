<CENTER><H4>The Gaza Students Campaign for Academic Freedom<BR>
works to guarantee the access of all Palestinian students wishing to study in the<BR>West Bank to their universities or places of higher education.</H4></CENTER>

<P>The Oslo accords were taken in the context of the Palestinian and Israeli leaders' detemination "to put an end to decades of confrontation and to live in peaceful coexistence, mutual dignity and security."  The Gaza Students Campaign for Academic Freedom calls on the Israeli authorities to take immediate steps with respect to students from the Gaza Strip which will in turn manifest their ongoing commitment to promote peace and a better future for the region:</P>

<B><OL>
<LI>State unequivocally their support for the Gaza students right to continue their education at the university most suited to their academic and personal circumstances;
<LI>Adopt, publish, and follow standardized and transparent procedures which will enable all students to continue their studies uninterrupted.
</OL></B>

<P>It is possible to resolve this issue successfully for all parties involved.  It is possible to facilitate the development of Palestinian young people while at the same time respecting Israel's perceived security concerns.  Gaza students residing in the West Bank cannot possibly represent a greater security risk than any other resident of the West Bank.</P>

<P>The potential to achieve peace in the region can only be heightened when young people are educated and given a sense of optimism for their future.  The generation emerging today will decide the future course of the region.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"We, the undersigned, call upon Prime Ehud Barak and the Government of Israel to guarantee academic freedom for the students, teachers and staff of Gaza who work and study in the West Bank. We call on Israel to adopt, publish, and follow standardized and transparent procedures which will enable all students to continue their studies uninterrupted. We believe that Palestinian education is of great importance to the peace process, and call upon Israel to ensure that this education is not denied."</BLOCKQUOTE>
