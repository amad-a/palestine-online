<BLOCKQUOTE>As a child in Nusseirat Refugee Camp in Gaza, Najim dreamed of the day he would study sociology at Birzeit University.  When he finished his school leaving exam in 1992, he was accepted at Birzeit and enrolled in the university to study sociology.  From the first day of reaching the university, studying has been a continuous struggle.  He has  never been granted a permit, nevertheless he is scheduled to graduate this year--if all goes well.  After graduating from Birzeit, he hopes to get a scholarship to continue his studies. </BLOCKQUOTE>
