continue your education? </I></CENTER><BR>

<CENTER><I>How would you feel if you were not allowed to travel 100 km to

<BR>
<P>Like all Palestinians, students from the Gaza Strip face difficulties
travelling  between Gaza and the West Bank.   Between March 1996 and
January 1998,  over 1,500 students from Gaza registered at West Bank
universities were  prohibited from traveling to their place of study
because of the Israeli  Government's arbitrary denial of travel and
residence permits.  Students who were already in the West Bank and chose
to continue their studies did so  'illegally'.  In January 1998, a handful
of students were issued with short term  permits, which have now expired
without being renewed.  Currently, hundreds of  Gaza students are studying
'illegally', living under the constant threat of arrest,  detention and
deportation to Gaza.  Many have been obliged to abandon their  studies in
the face of such obstacles. </P>

<P>Since an extended full closure was imposed on the Palestinian Occupied
Territories in 1991, sealing off the West Bank and Gaza Strip,
Palestinians  have not been allowed to enter Israel or East Jerusalem
without a permit. This  means that travel between the West Bank and Gaza
is restricted.  Israel has  never established clear regulations for the
permit application process, which is  excessively bureaucratic.  </P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5> arbitrary procedures </FONT></CENTER>

<P>Israeli human rights organization B'Tselem recently described the
procedures  which Gaza students face trying to apply for permits as
"improper  and...arbitrary".  Applicants for permits are not informed of
the reason why they  have been rejected and they are not given an
opportunity to appeal. All travel  permits are cancelled each time Israel
imposes a full closure on the Palestinian  Occupied Territories.</P>

<BR>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5> have the peace accords made a difference? </FONT></CENTER>


<P>In both the 1993 Declaration of Principles between Israel and the PLO and
the  Interim Agreement of 1995, Israel agrees to guarantee freedom of
movement  between Gaza and the West Bank.  This has not been implemented.
Moreover,  the right to education is a fundamental human right that must
not be subject to  political concerns or negotiations. </P>

<P><CENTER> <font size=4> want to learn <A HREF="issue.html">more</A> about the issue?</font></CENTER></P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5> the campaign for academic freedom </FONT></CENTER>


<P>The Israeli government continues to deny and restrict Gaza students' right
to  education.  Responding to a 10,000 signature petition organized by the
Gaza  students Campaign in March 1998, an Israeli official at the London
embassy  identified Gaza students collectively as "<I>a dangerous group</I>".  A
spokesperson  for Binyamin Netanyahu told the BBC World Service News in a
broadcast from  4 March 1997, that not a single Gaza student could be
allowed to study in the  West Bank, since the students '<I>meet the profile
of terrorists</I>'.</P>

<BR><BR>
<P>The Gaza Students Campaign is now entering its third year of lobbying for
academic freedom for Gaza students.  The 1998 campaign was launched on 17 August and will culminate with Gaza Students Action Day on 19 November, an international day of action to raise awareness of the situation faced by Gaza students and to lobby the Israeli government to bring about a solution. The Gaza students problem is solvable in a "win-win" manner. It is possible to respect the right of students to education while fulfilling the perceived security needs of Israel. </P>

<CENTER><FONT SIZE=5> 19 november 1998 - international gaza students action day </FONT></CENTER>


<P>Gaza Students Action Day is an international day of action in support of
Gaza  students' right to education.  The Gaza Students Campaign, a
student-based  international volunteer organization, coordinates action
internationally from its  base at the Human Rights Action Project of
Birzeit University, Palestine, and  puts new campaigners in touch with
local networks. </P>
 
<P>We currently have volunteer networks in 23 countries. The Campaign's
web-site will be a major campaign resource and will be regularily updated with campaign news from around the world.</P>
