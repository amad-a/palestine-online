<H2>INSTRUCTIONS FOR ORGANISING A PETITION</H2></CENTER>


<P>If you'd be happy to organise a petition at your own university or college, here are some guidelines:</P>


<OL>
<LI><P><A HREF="mailto:nsmg100@cam.ac.uk">Send me</A> the NAME of the petition organiser; the UNIVERSITY at which the petition will be compiled; the CITY and COUNTRY where the university is located; contact ADDRESSES (preferably EMAIL, if you have it) where we can get hold of you.</P>

<P>For example:</P>

<ADDRESS><FONT SIZE=2>Nick Guyatt<BR>
University of Cambridge<BR>
Cambridge, England<BR>
email: nsmg100@cam.ac.uk<BR>
fax: 00 44 (1) 223 334426<BR>
phone: 00 44 (1) 223 576900</FONT></ADDRESS>

<P>(Please send your full mailing address if that's the only way you can be reached)</P>

<LI><P>When we have your name and university, we will add you to our database of petition organisers. This will ensure that there is no more than one petition in circulation at any one institution, and will enable better co-operation between us all. We hope that this list may be available on our new Website in January.</P>

<LI><P>Using the following wording for the petition, collect as many signatures as you can from students, faculty and administrative staff at your institution. In English, the petition should read as follows:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>"We, the undersigned, call upon Prime Minister Netanyahu and the Government of Israel to guarantee academic freedom for the students, teachers and staff of Gaza who work in the West Bank. We call for Israel to introduce academic permits and a standardised, open system of procedures for dealing with applications. We believe that Palestinian education is of great importance to the peace process, and call upon Israel to ensure that this education is not denied."</BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>If you require a translated version, we have prepared several in Cambridge; please ask me for one when you write to me with your name and details.</P>

<LI>Towards the end of January 1997, we will be getting in touch with all the petition organisers to discuss the best ways of submitting the petitions to the Israeli embassies around the world. We will also discuss media coverage and strategies for ensuring that the petition has the maximum effect. If you have any good ideas about this before then, please get in touch
