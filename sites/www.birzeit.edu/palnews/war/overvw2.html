<CENTER><H2>Overview and Updates of the Developments</H2> <H3>Saturday 28th September - Friday 4 October 1996</H3> <P> <B>BY HANAN ELMASU, BIRZEIT UNIVERSITY CONTINUING EDUCATION DEPARTMENT, <BR>ASSISTANT TO DIRECTOR</B></P> </CENTER> <BR> 


<H3>Update:  Saturday September 28, 1996</H3>
<P><B>The Health Development Information Program</B> issued an urgent
appeal on September 28, 1996, in which the following was
stated:</P>

<P>Since clashes between Palestinians and Israeli military
forces began on September 25, 1996 there have been
continuous violations of medical neutrality by the Israeli
army.  Medical personnel have come under attack, and the
sick and wounded have had their access to medical care
deliberately restricted.</P>

<P>In one of the most serious cases, a 27 year old nurse,
Bassil Naem, who worked in the delivery suite at A-Shifa
Hospital in Gaza City, was shot and killed by Israeli
soldiers on September 26.  A number of medical personnel
have received injuries whilst trying to administer medical
care at the scenes of the recent violence. Dr. Mustafa
Barghouthi, President of the Union of Palestinian Medical
Relief committees, was shot while administering emergency
treatment to someone suffering severe injuries and bleeding.
Dr. Barghouthi received injuries to the back, shoulder, and
face, from a high velocity sniper's bullet, despite being
clearly visible in a doctor's white coat.  Dr. Barghouthi
received treatment in Ramallah hospital and was later
discharged.   One health professional was shot while
attending to someone inside an ambulance.  Israeli soldiers
were clearly trying to prevent the wounded from receiving
medical assistance.</P>

<P>Among other health workers injured are Mohammed Al Nimnim, a
40 year old ambulance driver from Gaza who received bullet
wounds; Mohammed Imad, an operating theater nurse from Gaza;
Mohammed A-Shemali, 40 years old, a staff member of Ramallah
Hospital who was shot in the left leg;  and Aamar Ahmed
Khalil Da'as, a 22 year old ambulance driver working with
the Palestinian Red Crescent Society in Al-Bireh.</P>

<P>Many of those with injuries were unable to receive prompt
medical treatment because the Israeli army restricted the
movement of ambulances carrying life saving equipment and
personnel to the sites of the clashes.   In addition, those
not injured during the conflict itself have also become the
target of Israeli aggression.  Najat Mustafa Mohammed Musa
from Burin was in advanced labor and trying to reach a
hospital in Nablus when she arrived at an Israeli
checkpoint.  Israeli soldiers detained her at the checkpoint
for several hours, refusing her admission to Nablus.  As a
result she delivered her child in a car beside the
checkpoint without appropriate medical supervision.</P>

<P>Earlier today two cars carrying urgently needed medical
supplies were trying to reach the northern West Bank. The
cars were stopped by Israeli military personnel at Beit El
and near Jalazon refugee camp, and the medical supplies were
removed from the cars.</P>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Update:  Sunday September 29, 1996</H3>
<P>Israeli authorities reopened today the Haslomian tunnel
under the guard of over 2,000 Israeli soldiers and police.
The re-opening sparked new protests in which several
Palestinians were injured and dozens arrested.  In the West
Bank and Gaza, peaceful protest marches were held in which
Christian leaders in Jerusalem, Ramallah, and Bethlehem
protested against the Israeli authorities actions this past
week.  The city of Hebron remained under a strict curfew.
</P>
<P>An Israeli official threatened that Israel is considering
disarming the Palestinian police.</P>

<P>Palestinian child Mohammad Afaneh (10 years old) from Bet
Oula in Hebron, died today after the Israeli authorities
refused to allow his transfer to Hadassah hospital in
Jerusalem.</P>

<P>West Jerusalem Mayor Ehud Olmert announced today that his
municipality is conducting digging works in three areas in
the so called "Mount Scopus region", meaning the Dome of the
Rock and its surroundings.</P>

<P>The following statistics were taken from a report issued by
the <B>Palestinian Human Rights Information Cente</B>r on September
29, 1996 concerning what it deems the Israeli "Shoot-to-
Kill" policy:</P>

<P>Seventy percent of the deaths which occurred last week were
from live ammunition wounds to the head and to the chest.
Preliminary statistics show that 45% of the fatalities were
shot in the head, while 25% were shot in the chest.</P>

<P>The age groups of those killed are as follows:</P>

<PRE>
Under 18:        14%
From: 18 to 25:  63%
From: 26 to 30:  12%
From: 31 to 40:  8%</PRE>

<P>77% were under 26 years old including a four-month-old
infant girl, and a three-year-old boy with leukemia who died
after he was denied access to Hadassah hospital in Jerusalem
from an Israeli checkpoint.</P>

<P>The Israeli military imposed a new closure which separated
Palestinian cities from surrounding villages and refugee
camps.</P>

<P>Israeli tanks and personnel carriers are still stationed at
the entrances and around Palestinian self-rule areas.
Israeli high-tech helicopter gun-ships are being used against
civilians in densely populated areas.</P>

<P><B>Threat and Use of Heavy Artillery:</B></P>
<UL>
<LI>September 26: Apache helicopter gunships were used against
civilians in Ramallah.
<LI>September 26: Deployment of tanks to the southern entrance
to El-Bireh, Nablus, Tulkarem, Jenin, Bethlehem and Hebron.
<LI>September 26: Portable grenade launchers near Rachel's Tomb
in Bethlehem.
<LI>September 27: Apache helicopter gunships were used against
civilians in densely populated Rafah.
</UL>



<P><B>Curfews and Raids:</B></P>
<P>The Israeli military authorities imposed curfews on
Palestinian villages and refugee camps in the West Bank
including Hizma (located on the circle road linking the
south and north of the West Bank), Kalandia refugee camp,
Ainabous village in Nablus and Sa'ir village in Hebron.
</P>
<P>Israeli police raids continued in Jerusalem neighborhoods
through September 29 in which Israeli police fired tear gas,
rubber bullets and beat Palestinian residents.  Twenty-two
of the injured were taken to Maqassad Hospital.   Settlers
attacked Anata village destroying Palestinian property.</P>

<P><B>Additional Checkpoints/New Permits Further Restrictions on
Movement Within the West Bank:</B></P>
<P>The siege of Palestinian cities which began on September 27
has been enforced by new Israeli  checkpoints to all
entrances of cities.  Palestinians from surrounding areas
have not been able to enter the cities which provide main
health services, education and employment. The Israeli
authorities also imposed new red-colored permits for
movement between Palestinian cities and villages as well as
refugee camps.</P>

<P>Three women in Nablus, and four others in nearby areas, were
prevented from going to hospitals to give birth.  At a
northern checkpoint in Nablus, a woman from Burin village
was in an ambulance in the advance stages of labor where she
was held up for several hours.   She was forced to give
birth at the checkpoint.</P>
<P>
Many of the hospitals are experiencing staff and medical
shortages.   Ambulances are being attacked by Israeli
soldiers who threw out the contents and beat the medical
staff.</P>

<P>To date, there are 1144 Palestinian injuries of which 165
are still in hospital and 23 of whom are in critical
condition.</P>

<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Monday September 30, 1996</H3>
<P>To date, there are 1158 Palestinian injuries of which 114
are still in hospital and 18 of whom are in critical
condition.</P>
<P>Netanyahu, Arafat, Hussein and Clinton prepared to meet in
Washington Tuesday while the West Bank, Gaza and East
Jerusalem were still the scenes of minor clashes between
Palestinian and Israeli forces.   Egyptian president Hosni
Mubarak, whose earlier offer to host a summit was rejected
by Israel, remained in Cairo. The Egyptian president said
Tuesday his absence from the summit is an indication that he
is not pleased with the "obstinance of Israel".  Sources
said the Egyptian president wants a clearer focus for the
summit and a commitment from Israel to abide by previous
peace agreements.</P>
<P>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu arrived in
Washington Monday night, proposing continuous negotiations
"between Israelis and Palestinians to clear obstacles to
peace”.   The Israeli leader flatly refused to close the
tunnel to ease the tensions, even though the United States,
a staunch Israeli ally, requested that he do so.   He also
stated that the tunnel issue was not on the Washington
Summit agenda.</P>

<P>Yasser Arafat arrived early Tuesday morning after spending
much of Monday in an unsuccessful attempt to persuade
Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak to attend. Before leaving
for the United States, Arafat said he would attend the
summit with no pre-conditions.</P>

<P>Clinton met with Jordan's King Hussein, the other Arab
leader invited to the summit, Monday evening.  Clinton is
first scheduled to meet with Netanyahu and then Arafat.
Jordan's King Hussein will join all three for another
meeting later in the day.</P>

<P>State Department spokesman Nicholas Burns said Monday that
no decision had been reached on any private meetings between
Netanyahu and Arafat.  The summit was scheduled to last two
days.</P>

<P>Meanwhile, in the West Bank and Gaza, the Israeli army has
deployed additional tanks and armored personnel carriers in
certain positions that makes it possible to strike the PA
territories despite the decrease of clashes between
Palestinians and Israeli soldiers.  Israeli security sources
explained that Israel has started implementing a plan that
aims to protect Israelis and might end up in regaining the
areas that were transferred to the Palestinian Authorities.</P>

<P>In Nablus, there are 36 Israeli tanks and armored personnel
carriers stationed a few kilometers away from the city's
borders.   In Jericho there are 26 tanks and armored
personnel carriers in the Jordan Valley area.  Rallies and
marches were held in the Gaza Strip, with few confrontations
and no injuries.</P>

<P>In Hebron and Jerusalem, Jewish settlers attempted to
provoke nearby Palestinians.   The Jewish "Temple Mount
Faithful" group attempted to enter the Dome of the Rock, but
were stopped by Israeli authorities.   Settlers also took to
the streets in Hebron, inciting local Palestinians.  Both
incidents caused an elevation in tensions in both areas.
Israeli soldiers attacked two Palestinian journalists, Mazen
Da'na and Imad Eid, during the confrontations in the Hebron
area.</P>

<P>Palestinian child Mohammad Sarahneh (3 years old) died today
after Israeli authorities refused to allow his transfer from
Hebron to Jerusalem for medical treatment.</P>

<P>Palestinian administrative detainees in Israeli prisons
declare a hunger strike in protest of the recent incidents.</P>

<P>British political and media sources say that several Israeli
high-ranking military officials are planning to submit their
resignations in protest against Netanyahu's government
handling of the recent events in the West Bank.
</P>
<P>The <I>Palestinian Deputy Minister of Health</I> issued a warning
of possible health disaster.  The ministry reported that the
Israeli army continued in not permitting Ministry of Health
vehicles carrying medicines, supplies, and other hospital
and emergency center requirements from moving from the
Ministry of Health central medicine and supplies stores to
the West Bank governorates.  Despite special arrangements
made by the Liaison Office for the movement of the Ministry
of Health vehicles, many of the vehicles attempting to cross
checkpoints have been turned back and the medical supplies
carried within them confiscated by the Israeli military.</P>

<P>For the fifth day in a row, the Ministry’s immunization
program has been brought to a complete halt because clinics
could not be opened as a result of the inability transport
physicians and nurses to their work posts in the primary
care clinics.  The interruption of the immunization program
against six major diseases brings threats of epidemics of
these diseases amongst Palestinian children.  The Ministry
was also unable to transport injured patients who required
transfers from Tulkarm, Jenin, and Qalaqilia to Ramallah and
Maqassed hospitals.  They were all returned from Israeli
checkpoints.</P>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Tuesday October 1, 1996</H3>
<P>The Washington Summit began today in an effort to clarify
Palestinian and Israeli positions and discuss measures to
avoid recurrences of the violence which occured this past
week.  Israeli PM Netanyahu stated that he wanted to start
non-stop negotiations with Palestinians after the Washington
Summit.
</P>
<P>Israeli authorities continue to enforce a tight military
siege on PA territories for the fifth day now, in addition
to reinforcing military presence with tanks and armored
personnel carriers at Palestinian cities entrances.
Palestinians were also banned from moving between
Palestinian cities.  Curfew was kept imposed on many areas
while some confrontations took place between Palestinian
and Israeli soldiers, especially in the Hebron district.
Toulkarem and Nablus towns are still under a massive
military siege by Israeli troops. Bethlehem city also
witnessed popular rallies honoring Palestinians killed
during last week’s clashes.   Palestinian cities and
villages are suffering severe shortages in food and medical
supplies.</P>

<P>In Gaza, two Palestinians died today of wounds sustained
during recent confrontations at Erez checkpoint.  Tamer
Masri (13 years old) and Sgt. Mohammad Shalayel were laid to
rest in an funeral that toured the whole area of Jabalia
Camp.  The Israeli army has deployed further troops and
armed vehicles in Rafah, at the southern end of the Gaza
Strip, further undermining Palestinian and Israeli
confidence.  A Palestinian family, while trying to return to
their home through an Israeli checkpoint, were ordered to
turn back by an Israeli soldier.  Unspecified security
reasons for the checkpoint's closure were cited.  Many other
travelers are backed up, waiting to get through military
checkpoints to return to their homes in the Gaza Strip and
elswhere in bordering regions of the West Bank.</P>

<P>Soldiers and settlers from Ramot, north west of Jerusalem,
attacked today Palestinian laborers who were heading to
their work near settlements in the area.  Israeli soldiers
then arrested and beat approximately 70 Palestinians.
Israeli Intelligence forces also stormed into the house of
Naser Qos, the personal guard of Faisal Husseini.  When they
couldn't find Naser, they left him a notice to show up at
the Russian Compound (Israeli Police headquarters in
Jerusalem), threatening that they will come back late in the
evening if he does not turn himself in.</P>

<P>Israeli authorities lifted the curfew on Hebron today from 5
am  to 9am.  Clashes erupted and resulted in few injuries.
Naser Shioukhi, an Associated Press reporter, and ABC
photographer Amer Ja'bari, were arrested by Israeli
authorities.  In another incident, a Jewish settler shot and
killed this morning Ziad Mahmoud Abdul Salam al-'Imleh, a
25 year-old Palestinian from Bet Oula village in Hebron. The
settler shot at al-'Imleh while the latter was heading to
work near Ajour region inside the Green Line.</P>

<P>Israeli authorities banned Israeli and foreign journalists
today from entering the Palestinian ruled areas.  The ban
was implemented for security reasons, Israel Army radio
reported.</P>

<P>Israeli Military sources also stated that Israel will demand
from the PA to dismiss around 200 Palestinian policemen who
used gunfire against Israeli soldiers during the recent
confrontations. The sources added that the Israeli army
started investigations to identify the Palestinian policemen
concerned. They added that the Israeli army will not allow
Israeli military personnel to resume joint patrols with
Palestinian policemen who shot or killed Israeli soldiers.
Israeli military were able to take pictures at least in 20
cases where Palestinian police were using gunfire against
Israeli soldiers, and those pictures will be forwarded to
the PA to take necessary measures.</P>

<H3>Wednesday October 2, 1996</H3>
<P>In a press conference after the completion of the Washington
Summit, US President Bill Clinton stated that some progress
was made but not as much as he had initially hoped.  The
summit failed to settle any disputes of the conflict except
that peace negotiations will continue.  Full peace
negotiations were scheduled to resume this Sunday between
Palestinian and Israeli officials, with the mediation of
Dennis Ross, at Erez Checkpoint.   No specific timetables or
agendas were given for the negotiations, but it was stated
that the first issue to be discussed would be the
redeployment of Hebron.</P>

<P>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu stated before
leaving Washington that Israel will not compromise on any of
its positions concerning the whole peace process.  He also
refused to give a deadline on the redeployment of Hebron and
reiterated his refusal to close down the tunnel.</P>

<P>The European Union issued a statement in Luxembourg
yesterday while the four leaders were beginning talks at the
Washington Summit.  The statement strongly criticized Israel
for not honoring its commitments in the context of the
Middle East peace process.  The European foreign ministers
called on both parties to show restraint and also demanded
that Israel reconsider its position in opening the tunnel
that caused the recent confrontations.  The European Union
statement also called on Israel to lift the closure imposed
on Palestinian territories and to start redeployment from
Hebron. The statement stressed that East Jerusalem is not
under Israeli sovereignty.  This European position is the
first clear stand on the Jerusalem issue.
</P>
<P>Meanwhile, in the West Bank and Gaza, Israeli military
remained in a state of  high alert, with snipers, tanks and
troops still deployed at all entrances to the West Bank, with
statements from the military that they were prepared to use
all fire power if the summit did not go well.  New orders
were given today to the Israeli army to use gunfire
extensively if faced with any attacks from Palestinians.  A
statement was also made in which the army refused to resume
joint patrols with Palestinian police in the West Bank.
Israeli authorities banned Palestinians holding Palestinian
passports from crossing the Allenby Bridge to Jordan.
</P>
<P>Throughout Palestinian Authority areas, all traffic movement
halted at 12:00 noon today for five minutes to express
support for PA head Yasser Arafat in his talks at the
Washington Summit and to honor Palestinians who died during
last weeks confrontations.</P>

<P>While officials were gathered at the Washington Summit,
violence continued in various areas of the West Bank, in
particular in Hebron.  The following is an account recorded
by <B>PHRIC</B> reporting the murder of a Palestinian youth in
Hebron today:</P>

<P>Israeli soldiers shot dead Ashraf Abdul Karim Issa al-Mtur,
12, from Sa'ir village in Hebron after a settler opened fire
on Mu'taz Mohammad Ali Jaradat, 14, at the Wad Khamis area
west of Sa'ir village.  Two other youths were injured:
Ghalib Mahmoud Abbas Froukh, 17, and Ayman Hussein  Mahmoud
Jabbarin, 17.   It was also reported that many other
Palestinians are presently being detained by the Israeli
authorities for their involvement in the clashes.</P>

<P>After the settler shot Mu'taz, villagers gathered to try to
save him.  Soldiers dispatched to the site opened fire
randomly at residents, killing al-Mtur with two bullets to
the abdomen.  Froukh also sustained two bullets to the
abdomen, while Jabbarin was shot in the leg.</P>

<P>Residents tried to take Froukh and Jabbarin in private cars
to the hospital in Hebron.  Israeli soldiers took Froukh out
of the car.  Jabbarin made it to Alia hospital but at 23:00,
during a raid on the hospital, soldiers took Jabbarin as he
was to be admitted for surgery.  Residents later found out
that Froukh and Jabbarin had been taken to Hadassah hospital
in West Jerusalem and are presently in the intensive care
unit.</P>

<P>Members of Mtur's family told a PHRIC fieldworker that they
tried to look for Ashraf who they thought had gone missing
after the clashes. His father was told by soldiers involved
in the shooting that there was a body at the military
headquarters in Hebron.   He then went to the headquarters
and found out that the body was his son's.   At 3:00 in the
morning, the soldiers released the body to the family.
Ashraf Mtur was buried at dawn in Sa'ir.</P>

<P>Further incidents were reported of Kiryat Arba settlers
shooting at Palestinians living near the settlement.</P>

<P>In other areas of the West Bank:  the villages of Hizma and
Qalandia Camp remained under strict curfew for the third day
in a row.  Many schools in the Jerusalem area couldn not
hold regular classes because of the imposed closure.  Also
in  Jerusalem, a large demonstration took place organized by
thousands of Jewish settlers who marched  from Harhoma
settlement to the Old City and into the Wailing Wall area.
The march was in honour of the Jewish holiday Succot.  It
was reported that the Jerusalem municipality allocated a sum
of $30,000 in providing security for the demonstration
today.</P>

<P>Despite the recent violence in the region, settlers in the
Nablus area continued to confiscate Palestinian lands today
designated for settlement expansion.  Bulldozers were also
reported to be beginning digging works for a new by-pass
road today near the settlement of Bet El on lands
confiscated from El-Bireh residents, a suburb of Ramallah.
The confiscations and digging works were a result of the
recent approval by the Israeli government of 3,800 new
housing units to be built in the West Bank and the Jordan
Valley.  Israeli Defense Minister Yitzhak Mordechai approved
1,800 housing units to be added on to Metetyahu, a
settlement west of Ramallah.  The new construction is
planned on an area of 508 dunums (127 acres) of confiscated
land belonging to Ne’lin and Deir Qaddis villages in the
Ramallah area.</P>

<P>The other 2,000 housing units were approved by the Israeli
Civil Administration Higher Planning Council and are slotted
for development in the Jordan Valley area and remaining
areas in the West Bank.  In another move in Hebron, Israeli
Deputy Minister for Housing, Me’ir Porosh said that he had reveived
approval this week for 70 new homes to be built south east
of the city.   The announcement followed a previous order of
confiscation of 15 dunums (4 acres) of Palestinian land in
the Byar al-Mahawer region, within the Hebron municipality
borders, to be used for military purposes.  The lands, which
lie near Kiryat Arba settlement and old city areas near the
Ibrahimi Mosque, belong to the family of Sa’id Hasan Da’na
and the Abu Seifan families.  The land owners said they were
given 10 days notice to evacuate their lands.</P>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Thursday October 3, 1996</H3>
<P>There is a general feeling of disappointment amongst
Palestinians as a result of the failure of the Washington
summit to resolve any pressing issues.   The failure of the
summit is expected to bring further tension into the region.
Israeli PM Netanyahu stated in a press conference upon his
return that he is committed to redeployment from Hebron,
provided that Israelis living there are granted security.
PA Higher Education Minister Hanan Ashrawi stated that it
was clear that US President Clinton could not save the peace
process and that the Israeli army is still closing the areas
on Palestinians.</P>

<P>The major cities of the West Bank remain under strict
military seige by Israeli tanks and helicopter gun ships.
Military sources stated that additional military
reinforcements were being deployed along the Green Line.
Israeli military reinforcements were also placed along the
Egyptian borders in Gaza. Jordan has closed Al-Karama
Crossing into Jordan to Gazan residents until further
notice.   Israeli Ha'aretz newspaper quoted an Israeli
officer saying that any Palestinian, who tries to cross the
‘forbidden line’ and gets close to an Israeli checkpoint,
will be shot.   Head of Logistics Department at the Israeli
army said that the present deployment might last the whole
winter.   Al-Hayat Al-Jadida, a local Palestinian newspaper,
reported incidents of Israeli soldiers forcing Palestinians
from Hebron to drink their urine, as part of the regular
humiliation tactics imposed by Israeli soldiers posted in
Hebron.</P>

<P>Israeli special units working in the West Bank arrested
today four Birzeit University students and headed towards
the settlement of Halmish.</P>

<P>The European Union stated today that they will send a fact-
finding mission to the region in order to help move along
the peace process.   The mission will include Troika
ministers and will attempt to alleviate the present critical
condition of the peace process with visits to leaders and
officials of both sides.   The German government also stated
today that it will offer $291,060 in humanitarian aid to
Palestinian victims of the recent incidents in the West Bank
and Gaza; the money will be used in buying two ambulances
and other emergency, medical equipment.</P>

<P>Palestinian officials reported that the Palestinian economy
loses daily  an amount of $10 million due to Israeli
restrictions enforced after the recent violence witnessed in
the Palestinian lands.   Samir Hleili, Deputy assistant to
the Palestinian Minister of Trade, stated that the recent
closure caused a severe shortage in basic food items and
fuel.  The Palestinian Trade Union stated that
approximately 23,000 Palestinian workers, who have Israeli
work permits, are banned from working in Israel these days.</P>
<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Friday October 4, 1996</H3>
<P>Israel deployed over 3,000 soldiers and police near the Al-
Aqsa mosque compound in the Old City of Jerusalem and
stopped many Palestinians from entering.  Hundreds of
Palestinians were arrested throughout the cities and
villages of the Palestinian territories during
confrontations, which continued sporadically throughout the
day.</P>

<P>Israel reintroduced a strict closure over the Palestinian
territories, this time adding an “internal closure,” whereby
self-rule Palestinians cannot move from one town to another.
A curfew Israel clamped on Hebron during the second day of
clashes remains in force.</P>

<P>Israel today stated that the PA’s use of live ammunition
against Israeli troops is also a "severe violation of the
Peace agreements".   However, it is difficult to find a
basis for such statements.  The recent violent clashes
between Palestinians and Israeli forces were the first
direct engagement between the two sides since the signing of
the Oslo Accords.   However, provision was made in the
Interim Agreement for such an eventuality.   The following
exerpts of the Interim Agreement were taken from today’s
issue of the Palestine Report, a weekly publication of the
Jerusalem Media and Communication Center:</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><H4>Israeli-Palestinian Interim Agreements on the West Bank and
the Gaza Strip:  September 28, 1995</H4>

information is based on al-Haq's documentation, unless
otherwise indicated. Documentation is still being carried
out in the field. The events that started on the morning of
24 September resulted in a series of violations of
Palestinian human rights, particularly the right to life,
the right to physical safety, and various economic and
social rights.</P>

<P><B>Killings by the Israeli Security Forces:</B></P>

<P>63 Palestinians and one Egyptian soldier were reported
killed by the Israeli security forces. The vast majority
were killed by live ammunition fired into the upper part of
the body.   At least 16 children were killed.   The
breakdown of  the statistics is as follows:</P>

similar to those caused by dumdum bullets, and a large
number were shot in the upper part of the body.</P>

<P>In the early hours of 26 September 1996 the Israeli
authorities imposed a military siege on the towns and
villages of the West Bank by declaring Area C (Palestinian
controlled areas) to be a closed military areas.   Area C is
about 70 per cent of the entire area of the West Bank and
its closure consequently isolates all Palestinian population
centers, regardless of whether they are located in Areas A,
B, or C.  The siege is still in effect.</P>
<P><B>Economic and Agricultural Losses:</B></P>

<P>According to the Palestinian Ministry of Agriculture, the
agricultural sector lost at least 1.5 million US dollars per
day from the combined effects of the internal siege and the
strict closure of Israel and Jerusalem from the rest of the
West Bank and from the Gaza Strip.   According to the
Palestine General Federation of Trade Unions, the closure of
Israel and Jerusalem prevented 32,000 workers from
proceeding to their work (17,000 from the Gaza Strip and
15,000 from the West Bank). In addition,  20,000
Palestinians who normally work illegally inside Israel and
Jerusalem were also unemployed.  During the current period
of closure and siege the rate of unemployment is estimated
to have risen to 70% in the Gaza Strip and 55% in the West
Bank.  The PGFTU has also quantified the total losses to the
Palestinian economy caused by the siege and closure as
amounting to about 10 million US dollars per day.</P>

<P>Al Haq will report on the exact sequence of events and final
statistics will be published in a longer report to be issued
by al-Haq in the coming few days.</P>
