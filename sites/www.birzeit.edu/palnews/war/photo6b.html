<H3>Day 2: Thursday 26th September 1996, "The seriousness of things"</H3>

<P>The loss of life had touched everyone. Here, Yasser Abdul Ghani's distraught father is comforted by relatives and friends. Israel would later announceme that all Palestinian Police who had opened fire on Israeli soldiers were 'wanted', one has to conclude that the only fair thing to do would be to issue a similar response. What about the use of live ammunition by Israeli soldiers on unarmed civillians? Is this somehow not a crime? Public Relations photographer Yasser Darweesh told of how Israeli soldiers danced and congratulated each other when they shot people on the first day, slapping palms with each other, and saying "Good shot, you got him in the head." When I asked Yasser why he hadn't photographed this, he told me, "I couldn't believe what I was seeing. I was so shocked I didn't think to." Reports from a PBC journalist I know called Muhammed confirmed exactly this. Injured in a car accident during the clashes, he told me from his hospital in a voice of disbelief, "Theye were dancing. They were laughing. I couldn't believe I was seeing this." Yasser added, "I will never forget what I saw on that day. Never." <I>Photo by Saleem Daoud</I></P>

<P>Highlighted, an Israeli armoured personnel carrier at the edge of Zones A and C  near Beit El settlement, a few hundred metres from the center of Ramallah. When these armoured vehicles turned up it reinforced what the Palestinians have known all along. They are under seige in their own country. A number of reports, yet unconfirmed, say that Netanyahu told Arafat he would "shell Palestinian towns and cities" if Arafat did not get his troops to stop shooting. Just like Lebanon. Bombing villages to get them to reject those from their own country who are fighting those who have occupied their own country?  <I>Photo by Kifah al-Fani</I></P> <BR>

<P>No one was unaffected by the week's war. Yuppies ("Kit Kats" in the Ramallah vernicular, a reference to those who buy imported chocolate) who parked their cars in the wrong place had the windows shot out. Live ammunition of course. The holes were clearly bullet holes and nothing else. The slaughter, for the first time broadcast continually on the Palestinian television news channels, made everyone an eye witness. Everyone was involved. <I>Photo by Nigel Parry</I></P>

<P>It was a war. Check out these two guys. They are journalists. Bullet proof vests and helmets added to their usual clobber of cameras and sound equipment. This spoke a loud word about the nature of the assault on the Palestinian demonstrators they were filming. <I>Photo by Saleem Daoud</I></P>
