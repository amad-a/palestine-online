<H3>Day 2: Thursday 26th September 1996, "The face of war"</H3>

<P>As we moved closer to the checkpoint, we had to duck and run across 
side roads, hugging shop fronts to avoid getting injured. Above, Israeli 
snipers on the hillsides, well inside the border of zones A ad C, would 
occasionally open fire. (Click image f
or complete picture). As they spread out, it really felt like an invasion was imminent. Palestinians who witnessed this believed that they were fighting for their land and their lives. The atmosphere was electric. <I>Photo by Nigel Parry</I></P>

<P> A Palestinian Policeman strains his eyes to see the snipers on the hillside. After the demonstrators had been moved well back and as bursts of automatic fire rattled through the air, it was clear that we were in a war situation. Israeli troops continu
ed what they had been doing during the day and angry Palestinians Police returned their fire. There was a feeling of justice involved, the Palestinian Police furious at having had to stand and watch their people, armed only with stones, picked off one aft
er another on the streets. Their opportunity to hit back was clearly very satisfying. <I>Photo by Nigel Parry</I></P>

<P>A member of the Palestinian Preventative Security Force prepares to fight the Israelis. Civillian shopkeepers in the area, who had guns they shouldn't legally have, unpacked them from their shops. No policeman complained. This was a war the Israelis ha
d started and every person knew his duty was to man the barricades. The continuing encroachment into the autonomous areas by Israeli troops was a violation of the Oslo Accords, which does not allow this kind of activity. <I>Photo by Nigel Parry</I></P>
