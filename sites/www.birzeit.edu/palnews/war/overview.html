<BR>
<H3>Monday September 23, 1996</H3> <P>In the late hours of Monday September 23, Israeli military forces, officials from the Israeli Ministry of Tourism, and the Israeli Mayor Ehud Olmert illegally opened up an entrance to the Western Wall Tunnel beneath the steps of the al-Umariyya School, which is located on the Via Dolorosa, one of the main streets of the Old City of Jerusalem. The Israeli Ministry of Religion has been working on excavating this tunnel, which runs from the Wailing Wall north, along the side of the western wall of the third most holiest Islamic site, Haram al-Sharif, since 1968. Much of the work of excavation has taken place in secret. The tunnel, 480 meters in length, consists of a long passageway leading into an ancient underground canal which in turn leads into a double cistern known as the Struthion Pool, located beneath an Islamic Waqf property, the Via Dolorosa, and the Convent of the Sisters of Zion.</P> 

<P>Such actions are in breach of the international law of belligerent occupation, which requires an occupying power to refrain from making fundamental changes in occupied territory.</P> 
<BR><HR><BR>
<H3>Tuesday September 24, 1996</H3> <P>A march led by community leaders in protest of the opening of the entrance to the Wailing Wall Tunnel, set off after noon prayers from the Haram al-Sharif in Jerusalem. Hundreds of Israeli troops were deployed inside and around the Old City. The marchers entered Suleiman Street, which lies between Damascus and Herod's Gates. There was a stand-off for 15 minutes while leaders of the march attempted to persuade Israeli soldiers to let the march proceed. Israeli soldiers then attacked the demonstrators, beating them with clubs and charging the crowd with horses. Eight persons were hospitalized, including Hassan Tahboub, the Minister of Religious Affairs for the Palestinian National Authority.</P> 
<BR><HR><BR>

<H3>Wednesday September 25, 1996</H3> <P>Demonstrations and clashes between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian demonstrators resulted in 263 casualties and 7 deaths, according to the administrative director of Ramallah Hospital.</P> 

<P>At least five Birzeit students were hospitalized with serious injuries, one in intensive care. The student, Yasser Abdel Ghani, aged 23, was shot with live ammunition in the chest and received open-heart surgery from Ramallah Hospital doctors on the way to the operating theater. Despite two wounds to the heart and one to the lung, his condition improved slightly during the day and he remained in stable but critical condition.</P> 

<P>Of the 263 wounded that passed through Ramallah hospital, approximately 75-100 were Birzeit students who were treated and later released. Many of the injuries resulted from shots fired at close range. A Public Relations Officer of Birzeit University at the hospital described the scenes in the hospital as "chaotic". He continued, "There were stretchers everywhere, blood all over the floor. There were so many casualties that there was no time for the hospital staff to clean until much later that night."</P> 

<P>Birzeit University President Hanna Nasir stated that, "Students were en route to the Al-Aqsa Mosque in Jerusalem, which Israel claims is open to all Palestinians. Yet they were halted at a checkpoint deep in the West Bank. This is not just about the tunnel issue," stated Dr. Nasir, "ongoing Israeli violations of the spirit and letter of the Oslo accords have made it impossible for Palestinians to stand silently."</P> 

<P>Wednesday’s clash was the most serious violence of its kind since Israel began handing over parts of the West Bank and Gaza to Palestinian self-rule in May 1994.</P> 

<P>Israel closed its borders with the West Bank and Gaza, and placed armoured tanks at all checkpoints, barring thousands of Palestinians from jobs inside Israel.</P> 

<P>The following is a detailed description of what took place in cities throughout the West Bank and Gaza:</P> <BR>

<H4>RAMALLAH</H4> <P>Around noon a march was led in protest of the Israeli authorities' illegal opening of the entrance of the Western Wall Tunnel in Jerusalem, close to the Muslim shrine of al-Haram al-Sharif. The march, consisting of thousands of unarmed Palestinians, including school and university students, approached the Israeli checkpoint lying south of Al-Bireh on the Ramallah-Jerusalem road. There were initially around 60 Israeli soldiers deployed on two hills which lie on both sides of the road, with reinforcement arriving soon afterwards. Israeli soldiers then began to open fire with rubber bullets and live ammunition on the civilians who were demonstrating at the checkpoint. Shooting continued all afternoon, with Israeli soldiers using live and rubber bullets. In the late afternoon Israeli soldiers entered Area A, which is under the control of the Palestinian National Authority, and clashed with Palestinian security forces. Snipers in an Israeli helicopter fired on the Palestinian security forces, in addition to dropping tear gas canisters and sound bombs to quell the Palestinian demonstrators.</P> 

<P>Four Palestinian officers and three civilians were killed. 263 Palestinians were injured in the shooting. with dozens of critically injured and 45 persons requiring immediate operations. At least 25 of the injured admitted to the hospital suffered from high velocity bullet wounds to the brain and chest. Doctors from the Union of Palestinian Medical Relief Committees, the Palestinian Red Crescent Society, and other health professionals, were called to the scene of the demonstration.</P> <P>However, they also came under fire whilst trying to take the injured to hospital. One person was injured when a bullet entered an ambulance, and two others were shot as they were removing casualties from the area. Palestinian health professionals were placed on full emergency alert and were faced with attempting to address the needs of a large number of injured with very limited resources.</P> 

<P>Among those that died in Ramallah during the clashes were Ashraf Khalid Al Ashram, age 28 from Gaza; Munir Yousef Jumhor, age 22 from Beit Ana; Ra’id Ibrahim Sheraka, age 15 from Jelazon refugee camp; Abdul Jabar Hassan, age 20 from Deir Abu Mashaal; and Aiman Abdul Majid Owad. Those seriously injured include Hashim Ayoub, Mansur Shawamri, Yaser Abdel Ghani, and Ahmad Khalid Idkher.</P> 

<P>Exchange of fire continued until early evening. A general strike was observed in Jerusalem and the West Bank.</P> 


<BR>
<H4>JERUSALEM</H4> <P>Israeli police and border guards attacked Palestinian demonstrators with clubs near the Old City of Jerusalem. Palestinian protesters marched from Al-Aqsa Mosque towards one of the Old City’s gates (Damascus Gate) after mid-day prayers. Islamic Waqf (Trust ), PA Legislative Council members, PA officials and prominent figures in the city participated in a demonstration in protest of the digging and opening of a new entrance to a tunnel under the premises of Al-Aqsa Mosque. During the attack on demonstrators, the Israeli police beat PA Finance Minister Mohammed Zuhdi Nashashibi and Palestinian Mufti Sheikh Ikrima Sabri. Moreover, PA Minister of Religious Affairs Hassan Tahboub was run over by an Israeli police horse. He and eight other Palestinians were taken to Al- Maqassed Hospital in Jerusalem.

<BR>

<BR>
<H4>BETHLEHEM </H4><P>Bethlehem University students held a demonstration near the Bethlehem checkpoint, adjacent to Rachel’s Tomb.

<P>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who was on a three day visit to Europe, called Yasser Arafat from Germany and demanded that the Palestinian leader contain the violence, Netanyahu spokesman Shia Bazak said. The Israeli leader cut several hours from his trip and returned Thursday evening to chair an emergency Cabinet meeting after a state of emergency was called by the Israeli army in the West Bank and Gaza Strip. </P> 

<P>A round of Israeli-Palestinian peace talks scheduled for Thursday was postponed. Sa'eb Erekat, in a live telephone interview with CNN, accused the Netanyahu government of pushing Palestinians toward confrontation by not honoring its pledge to fulfill the peace agreement negotiated by previous Israeli governments. </P> 

<P>Palestinian leaders declared Thursday a national day of mourning , and merchants were asked to keep shops shut as funerals were held for those who died on Wednesday. </P> 

<P>The violence was “an escalation by the Israeli government against our people,” Arafat told reporters outside his Gaza city headquarters. </P> 

<P>Netanyahu blamed the trouble on Arab misinformation and appealed for order. “There have been wild and unfounded accusations,” Netanyahu said. He also said that he had personally ordered the completion of the tunnel. “The decision was good, but the timing was bad.” </P> 

<P>Arafat called on Palestinian police to stop shooting, and only fire in self-defense or to protect civilians. </P> 
<BR>
<H4>RAMALLAH</H4><P> In Ramallah, the funerals for those who died on Wednesday erupted into massive demonstrations at the Khamara checkpoint.

In Ramallah, hospital officials said Israeli troops began shooting and killed three Palestinians when they fired on thousands of Palestinians stoning their position. Palestinian police then opened fire on the Israeli troops.</P> 

<P>The violence began after more than 1,000 Palestinians marched along the highway leading to the checkpoint separating Ramallah's Palestinian controlled Area A, and Israeli controlled Area C. Israeli troops fired live ammunition and rubber bullets at the demonstrators when they came under a hail of stones and bottles. A heavy gun battle ensued between Palestinian police and Israeli soldiers. Israeli helicopters shot into the crowds of demonstrators and onlookers.

<P>At approximately 3:30, Israeli tanks and armoured personnel carriers entered Ramallah. Arafat ordered his 30,000 strong police force to shoot only if fired on. Palestinian policemen tried to hold back stone-throwers after the worst of the fighting had subsided, witnesses said. </P> 

<P>Israeli soldiers also opened fire at one of the cars belonging to the Palestinian Broadcasting Corporation. The car overturned and 3 members of the TV crew were admitted to hospital for medical treatment. </P>

Stone throwing incidents were reported in the Old City of Jerusalem, Abu Dis village, Sour Baher and Hizma village. Israeli police dispersed with clubs a march headed by Executive Committee member, Faisal Husseini, who was clubbed several times and admitted to the intensive care unit of the hospital.

At least 40 Palestinians were arrested and forty injured, with many being rushed to Maqassed Hospital for medical treatment. Hospitals throughout the city faced overcrowding. </P> 

<P>In another incident, Israeli military attempted to attack Arafat advisor Dr. Ahmad Tibi near the village of Al-Ram. In the morning a delegation of Meretz and Peace Now movements paid a solidarity visit to Islamic Waqf headquarters. </P>

<P>Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu this morning
reopened the Western Wall Tunnel.  Israeli riot police,
armed with batons, were deployed at the entrance of
tunnel, as Palestinians protested the re-opening.  All

prohibiting much needed medical supplies and doctors from
entering West Bank towns.  Netanyahu stated that he would
make no unilateral concessions to end the current crisis.
While speaking to a crowd of 6,000 visiting Christians,
he stated that he would never close the tunnel in
Jerusalem</P>.

<P>If violence continues in what Israeli authorities have
dubbed Operation Field of Thorns, Israel threatens to
disarm Palestinian forces.  Israeli military forces also
stated that the army would use whatever forces necessary
to defend Israeli lives.  At present, dozens of tanks and
armored personnel carriers have been placed at all
entrances to West Bank villages and the Gaza Strip, and
Israeli sharp shooters are positioned at 'tense points'
in the West Bank and Gaza.</P>

<P>After long negotiations, a summit was organized to be
held this week in Washington with Benjamin Netanyahu and
Yasser Arafat, providing the presence of Egyptian
President Hosni Mubarek.</P>

<P>The United Nations issued a UN Resolution calling for the
reversal of all acts which have resulted in the recent
violence between Palestinians and Israelis, insurance of
the safety and protection of all Palestinian civilians
and a resumption of peace negotiations.  The resolution
did not directly criticize Israel but it implicitly
called for the closing of the Western Wall Tunnel.  The
United States abstained from the vote.</P>
