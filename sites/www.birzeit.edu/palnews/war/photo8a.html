<P>During the attack, this Palestinian policeman, injured on the roof when fire converged on him from three sides (an indication of the fire control Israel had on the situation), was evacuated by civillian residents of the building. After they got him down, into a waiting ambulance, Israeli snipers opened fire on these civillians. The bullet holes can still be seen in the red awning. Fortunately, none were injured. <I>Photo by Saleem Daoud</I></P>
