The Arab Thought Forum have changed their URL and updated their site. We see an increase in information and useful information at that! This includes summaries of meetings concerning topics like the "role of opposition parties" which can be ordered in Arabic as well as their newsletter. Hopefully we'll see their journal on-line soon - at the moment just titles and authors that look very interesting.

The Applied Research Institute - Jerusalem, actually located in Bethlehem, has information on environmental issues in Palestine, including some fine research papers and a collection of interesting maps. You can download environmental profiles of Jenin, Nablus, Ramallah, Jerusalem, Jericho, Hebron and Bethlehem. As a bonus, the website is laid out in an attractive and logical manner with regular updates. Also included are papers on the water conflict from a Palestinian perspective and a Palestinian vision of environmental protection and sustainable development. ARIJ's website really came into its own when the <A HREF="http://www.arij.org/paleye/">Eye on Palestine</A> section was introduced in early 1997. See this section for excellent primers on understanding Israeli settlement policy, including the infamous Abu Ghnaim/Har Homa project and a host of others in the Jerusalem area.  Incredible maps, photos and arial photos facilitate understanding. Recent additions include an assessment of the Environmental Impact of Jewish Industries in the West Bank and material about the expropriation of Jalud lands. An <A HREF="./listserv.html">e-mailing list</A> is also available. ARIJ's website was featured twice in the <I>website of the month</I> section of the Complete Guide in 1997, for good reason. Visit to find out why. <B>Review last updated: 2 February 1998.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

</A></B> -  The Institute For Palestine Studies (IPS), founded in Beirut in 1963, is an independent nonprofit research and publication center, not affiliated with any political organization or government. IPS promotes research, analysis, and documentation on the Arab-Israeli conflict and its peaceful resolution. IPS publishes quarterlies in three languages: <I>Journal of Palestine Studies</I> (English), <I>Majallat al-Dirasat al-Filastiniyah</I> (Arabic), and <I>Revue d’etudes Palestiniennes</I> (French). Although the focus of each quarterly is on the Arab-Israeli conflict, the three journals offer different articles in keeping with the different interests of their subscribers. The website contains information about how to order the journals and other publications, all of which provide a rich resource for researchers interested in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The downside is that few papers or articles seem to be available for downloading. <B>Added to Complete Guide: 27 August 1996 / Review last updated: 16 December 1997.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

Through its
 publications and programs, the Center brings into focus the implications of specific U.S. policies on the Palestine question. Their site contains information on their publications, events organized by the Center, internships and results of polls concerning Palestine. They also provide information about the work of the Jerusalem Fund - an independent, non-political, non-partisan, non-sectarian charitable organization which supports the development of grassroots Palestinian initiatives in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.
