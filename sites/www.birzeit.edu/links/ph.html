His page is a great collection of links to Arab World resources. The Palestinian section offers an excellent collection of annotated links and a sub-section devoted to the personal homepages of Palestinians. I found a very appropriate quote that concurs perfectly with the aims of the Complete Guide, "Sometimes you have to read about Israel to know Palestine but always you have to read about Palestine to know Israel. I like to be neutral but there are many elements against me." This is the truth. A good links collection is one of the best presents you can give to the Web community.
