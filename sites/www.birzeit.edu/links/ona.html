It has since expanded to include other suffering children from other nationalities, based on their medical needs. The PCRF helps to locate care for children from all ethnic, religious, national and racial backgrounds. The main objective of the PCRF is to locate in the U.S. free medical care for children who cannot be adequately treated in the Middle East. The PCRF is the only organization bringing injured and sick Arab children to the U.S. for free care that is not available to them there." This is a well designed website, with information about the PCRF and its current work and projects. What is incredible about the site is the stories of children the organisation has helped, including several injured by the Israeli army and settlers.
