<A NAME="assali"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/assali.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.assali.com">Assali Computer Services, Ltd.: http://www.assali.com</A> - ACS Ltd. is a Jerusalem based computer services company focusing on: LAN & WAN design, installation and maintenance, Systems Development &amp; Internet Services. They have been in the software development business for 3 years developing custom applications for the local market. All products are MS Windows bilingual (Arabic/English) and ACS is "currently developing using Borland's Delphi with extensive experience in Visual Basic, MS Access and MSC++". A nicely laid out site with demonstration adverts for Pilgrims Palace Hotel and Mount of Olives Tours. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="baboun"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/baboun.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.baboun.com">Baboun Computers and CDs: http://www.baboun.com</A> - Baboun offers computers, software and a fax service for the Bethlehem area. A simple one-page website. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997 </B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="bailasan"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/bailasan.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.bailasan.com/">Bailasan, Palestinian Internet Services Company: http://www.bailasan.com/</A> - Bailasan, is another web design company that has appeared recently. Under construction but looks nice. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997 </B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="baraka"><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/baraka.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.baraka.org">Baraka: http://www.baraka.org</A> - Baraka, the Palestinian NGO service provider,  launched its website in mid-1996. Information is provided about PNGO (the Palestinian NGO network), JMCC (media services organisation) and a few other NGOs. Baraka's site has already been through one redesigning session so far, and provided an excellent section with the reports of Palestinisn NGOs during the clashes that swept the country in late September 1996. An e-mail address list for all its member organisations would be welcomed. Baraka recently began to offer dial-up PPP Web access to its members. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="gamasoft"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.gamasoft.com/">Gamasoft Online: http://www.gamasoft.com/</A> - A new company with a new Arabic website that is still developing. It has one of the coolest "Under Construction" graphics that Web-fatigued eyes have ever been laid on and a Palestine directory. They do need to sort out the many links off the homepage that lead to a "File not found - 404" message. I also tried to refuse their cookies and had to wade through 50 requests in three pages until I finally relented and accepted a cookie. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 27 August 1996 / Review last updated: 21 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<LI><A NAME="itsig"></A><A HREF="/national/itsig/">Information Technology Special Interest Group (ITSIG): http://www.birzeit.edu/national/itsig/</A> - In its own words, the non-official body ITSIG aims, "to develop an atmosphere of coordination and cooperation between the various bodies and individuals involved in the development of IT in Palestine; to create an advisory body for IT projects; to influence policy makers in IT related issues and developments; to formulate a view on policy and strategy; to coordinate efforts and activities between international and donor agencies in IT; and to raise the awareness of the Palestinian community in relation to IT." Possible areas of ITSIG contribution include, "development of telecommunications and infrastructure; IT services, e.g. banking, marketing, tele-medicine, industry, public services, etc.; technical IT policies, legal and regulatory frameworks and standards; IT regulations and policies to protect citizen and consumer rights, privacy and accessibility; and human resource development and education." The main purpose of this website seems to be to advertise ITSIG's mailing discussion list. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 2 July 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>


<A NAME="np"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.birzeit.edu/nigelparry/work/">Nigel Parry - website design and consultancy: http://www.birzeit.edu/nigelparry/work/</A> - A simple homepage with contact information and links to previously-designed websites.<FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 29 May 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pol"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/pol.jpg"><LI><A HREF="http://www.p-ol.com/">Palestine.On.Line: http://www.p-ol.com/</A> -  A new Palestinian ISP and content provider from the makers of <A HREF="#planet">Planet</A>. Under construction, but offers various searchable buisness and service directories. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="planet"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/planet.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.planet.edu">Palestinian Academic Network (Planet): http://www.planet.edu</A> - Planet was the first to provide a graphical PPP dial-up Web connection that is used - among others - by many departments at Birzeit University. Its website offers links and space to a few Palestinian organisations, mostly with an educational flavour. Planet just launched on-line business and other directories in the guise of <A HREF="#pol">Palestine.On.Line</A> above. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 6 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="palgate"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/palgate.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.palgate.com">PalGate: http://www.palgate.com</A> - PalGate will offer all kinds of Web services to the non-NGO sector, including web page hosting and virtual domain names. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 17 November 1996 / Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="palnet"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/palnet.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.palnet.com/">Palnet: http://www.palnet.com</A> - A private company, Palnet arrived on the scene offering e-mail and a Web connection to individuals and organisations for only $25 a month with unlimited access. PALNET's website has developed its links, although navigating through them can be a little boring, as only the titles of websites are offered with no reviews. The site also offers an interesting guide to Palestine's economy for those wanting to invest here, as well as government and business contact addresses. PALNET were at the Palestine International Festival 1996, offering opportunities for visitors to browse the Web and hopefully will make a reappearance this coming year. A dynamic company with 470 customers at the November 1996 count. Definitely the most dynamic Palestinian Internet service provider, offering a 128K leased line to Birzeit University. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 6 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="k5m"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/k5m.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.palnet.com/k5m/">Palnet@K5M: http://www.palnet.com/k5m/</A> - The first Palestinian Internet Cafe, based in Ramallah, a joint project between the premiere Internet Service Provider - Palnet - and K5M, Ramallah's first restaurant-cafe. Four computers offer users the chance to find out what it's all about at cheap rates. The pizzas are great in this restaurant, with the Birzeit Webmaster's recommendation being the Venetian. The homepage has both K5M restaurant and Internet price menus, photos of the cafe and a list of K5M's catering services. Warning: Do not read if you are hungry! In case you were wondering, K5M's name comes from the 6 brothers that own the restaurant - 5 of them have names starting with K and one with M. Or is it the other way round? No matter, visit the homepage and then visit the cafe! <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="undp"></A><IMG HSPACE=15 VSPACE=5 ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="images/undp.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.papp.undp.org">United Nations Development Programme (Programme of Assistance to the Palestinian People): http://www.papp.undp.org</A> - UNDP (PAPP) became interested in the idea of building a Palestinian research and academic network around 1994, sponsoring and training universities in how to provide e-mail to their faculty. The website is a good reference point for those interested in this work and the wider work of the United Nations. Formerly attached to the Internet via the Hebrew University, UNDP now offers its service through a connection with IBM. UNDP supplies Birzeit University's webserver's connection, just one example of the outstanding service it has provided to the Palestinian educational sector.  <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="zaytona"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.zaytona.com">Zaytona Soft: http://www.zaytona.com</A> - A private company offering Web design services and Internet software, one would expect it's homepage to be free of spelling mistakes and have more than 2 entries on its "Other Palestinian Links" page. Not particularly interesting. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 17 November 1996 / Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT><BR><BR>
