<A NAME="alquds"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.alquds.edu">Al-Quds University: http://www.alquds.edu</A> -  Al-Quds University was founded in the late 1970s when four separate Arab Faculties were
founded in the Jerusalem area. In 1984 these Faculties were unified under the umbrellas of Al-Quds
University. At the present time, the website tells us, "the university stands out as an example of distinguished academic achievements". The self-taught student web team wisely trod the pavements to other university webmasters' doors, a tactic that has clearly paid off. General information on the nuts and bolts of this Palestinian university, presented in a simply-constructed and attractive website. Every time you visit, a new department seems to pop up. The latest was their International Summer Program.  <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="annajah"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.palestine-net.com/education/najah.html">An-Najah University: http://www.palestine-net.com/education/najah.html</A> - A temporary website of this Nablus-based university, there is information on the university's history, academic facilities, institutes and centers, statistics, with contact numbers and addresses. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 5 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="aauj"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.aauj.edu/">Arab American University - Jenin: http://www.aauj.edu</A> - A brand spanking new website for the most recent of Palestine's Universities. You can find an overview, history, a list of colleges and pictures of the planned campus. The latter is obviously not built yet and looked a little like Disneyland to me. The university is being greeted with mixed feelings by Palestinian educationalists, as there are already 6 universities for the Palestinian West Bank population of 1.5 million, with <A HREF="#jsed">another graduate university</A> starting already. It's a shame people aren't building up the 2 universities in Gaza, where 1,500 students who wish to study in the West Bank insititutions <A HREF="/aff/index.html">have been trapped for the last year and a half</A>. This seems to have escaped the public relations team that wrote the material for the website, who claim that "the location of the university makes it accessible to students from all over Palestine, including pre-1948 Palestinians [note:  those living in Israel]". It is not clear why  Jenin is any more accessible than anywhere else in this tiny country. There are also fears, due to the American input from its "full affiliation with the California State University System" that the university will become a spearhead of normalisation with the Israelis. Regardless of the politics, the website is very well put together and very informative. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 5 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="bethlehem"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.bethlehem.edu">Bethlehem University: http://www.bethlehem.edu</A> - Launched on the Web on 17 May 1996, Bethlehem University's website will slowly but surely build into a useful resource. A staff directory has been established, as yet without e-mail addresses. Although the website is mainly academic-orientated, press releases and other material did appear that was related to the events that overtook the West Bank at the end of September 1996 in the wake of the opening of the tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem. Hopefully, this is a signal for more good things to come, although the webmaster is also the network administrator. Give the man a medal and an assistant! <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="birzeit"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=94 WIDTH=96 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="/index.html">Birzeit University: http://www.birzeit.edu</A> - Launched on the Web on 6 June 1996, Birzeit's is the largest website based in Palestine. A <A HREF="/web/1year.html">recent report on the first year</A> gives a good idea of where the website is going. The amount of information on the site is the result of a deliberately delayed launch, a growing training programme and and several personnel working on this project. Sections include:

You will find information about courses in languages, computers, management training, community development and capacity building. Very nicely designed website that works in both Internet Explorer and Netscape and full, full, full of information. A definite golden olive. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 1 June 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>



<A NAME="icc"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.ibrahimieh.edu">Ibrahimieh Community College: http://www.ibrahimieh.edu</A> - A private, non-profit institute of higher education, the Ibrahimieh Community College website is still very much under construction but looked good even from its launch. The college is twinned with L'Universit&eacute; de Franch-Compte. Nothing new for a while. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

The IUG is located in Gaza City, close to the seashore and to the UNRWA's headquarters. It was established in 1978 "to serve the urgent education needs of about one million people living in Gaza Strip".<FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 7 January 1997</B></FONT>.

<A NAME="jsed"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.jsed.edu/">The Jerusalem School of Economics and Diplomacy: http://www.jsed.edu</A> - One of the new breed of well-designed Palestinian websites, this Ramallah-based university-under-construction is for graduates.  Palestine needs graduate studies, but again, like the comments about the <A HREF="#aauj">Arab American University in Jenin</A>, why not build an existing institution rather than start all over again? It may be a translation issue but the line "The faculty is <I>expected</I> to undergo post-graduate training and preparation at partner institutions in the United States and Europe" wasn't particularly reasuring for an institution setting out to <I>teach</I> graduates. One would have hoped they all had Ph.D.s already.  <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 5 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>
