<UL> <LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.tu-berlin.de/~hussin/palestine.html">Kifah Ibrahim ABBAD</A> - Studying in TU Berlin, Kifah is flying the flag with a good list of Palestinian links. Some of it is in German with his interests listed as "Hip Hop, Computer, und FUN,FUN,FUN". 

<LI><A HREF="http://members.wbs.net/homepages/h/a/m/hamas999.html">Shehadeh ABDELHALIM</A> - Shehadeh's homepage, entitled "Occupied Palestine", does not waste any webspace with the usual. His is a hard-hitting website for which he has sought out material related to Israel's violence against Palestinians, and the Islamic Resistance Movement (Hamas). Particularly useful is the English translation of the Hamas covenant. Difficult reading sometimes because of the graphic material and accompanying polemic text style but, in the end, isn't it okay to be angered by photographs of a UN workers removing a headless baby from the wreckage of Qana refugee camp? 

<LI><A HREF="http://sac.uky.edu/~wmahme00/">Wael M. AHMED</A> - Wael M. Ahmed, born in Shuqba in the West Bank, is a biotech student at the University of Kentucky. The site includes a history of his village, some beautiful photos of the landscape around Jericho, and a page of stockmarket humour. (Review by Michael O'Neill). 

<LI><A HREF="http://www.cs.uwm.edu/~ali/">Jalal Mohammad ALI</A> - Jalal graduated from and now works at the University of Wisconsin-Milwqaukee, and has put together a good homepage. I especially liked the imagemap interface on his homepage. Under construction, but looking promising. 

<LI><A HREF="http://www.angelfire.com/il/Husam/index.html">Husam BAGES</A> - Business management graduate living in Illinois whose page offers information about importing and exporting between Palestine and the United States. 

<LI><A HREF="http://www.flinet.com/~politics/">Norman ELLIOT</A> - If you have anything to do with the Middle East on the Web, you've probably got an e-mail message like this: "Hi, I am an American angry at being made a part of the oppression and dispossession of the Palestinian people. I think you will find my site to be the most hard hitting on the web. Visit at; http://www.flinet.com/~politics". Norman Elliot has been accused of being anti-Semitic in his offering, but that's a little tired an accusation these days for people who object to Israeli atrocities. Perhaps polemic, definitely angry, but the real test lies in his replies to accusatory e-mails in the various accessible through the various links off his homepage. No one who has ever publically worked for the Palestinians will be unfamilliar with the kind of vitriol appearing in these examples.

<LI><A HREF="http://www.ozemail.com.au/~hanieha/">Adam HANIEH</A> - Adam, living in Australia, has a page that covers Palestine and broader Middle East links with a particular emphasis on left-wing politics. 

<LI><A HREF="http://nbcs.rutgers.edu/~acer1/">Ashraf HUSEIN</A> - Ashraf's page is titled, "The Palestinian Revolution", and has photos from his recent visit to Palestine, and some information about his university, Rutgers. Nice kiffeyah/hatta background and interesting animated 'NEW' images. 

<LI><A HREF="http://www-personal.engin.umich.edu/~rami/">Rami KISHEK</A> - A really entertaining personal homepage from a Palestinian (now I really have seen it all!) who is into <I>Star Trek</I>. The URL Rami sent me goes to a page that states: "Kishek was born in 2359 in the city of Jerusalem, Palestine, Earth. He applied to Star Fleet Academy in 2376 and was admitted." How true, sometimes those of us who work here feel that only in <I>Star Trek</I> will the Palestinians have a state by 2376. Rami also believes in UFOs, it seems, so maybe he could arrange for those <I>Independence Day</I> critters to do to the Knesset what they did to the White House. Joking aside, he's a serious guy (how many of you have a Ph.D. in Nuclear Engineering?) with a great sense of humour, so visit now! 

<LI><A HREF="http://ourworld.compuserve.com/homepages/kishekart/">Marwan KISHEK</A> - Art exhibition from this former Birzeit University professor now living in Canada, featuring oil on canvas paintings of Palestine, Egypt and Canada. 

<LI><A HREF="http://www.student.hk-r.se/~pt94hma/">Hadi MAKHLOUF</A> - Hadli, a student in Sweden, was born in Lebanon, although his father is Palestinian. Not that you'll find any mention of it, but his father was Yasser Arafat's dentist. His page contains great Lebanon links and music. 

<LI><A HREF="http://www.accent.net/mokadi/">Tarik MOKADI</A> - Graphic designer living in Canada. </UL>
