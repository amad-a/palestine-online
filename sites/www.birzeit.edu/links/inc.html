<B>Bailasan, Palestinian Internet Services Company: <A HREF="http://www.bailasan.com/">http://www.bailasan.com/</A></B> - Nigel Parry reviewed this site about a year ago and said that in his opinion the site should have been titled, <I>How To Destroy Your Public Image Single-Handed 101</I>. Unfortunately things have not got any better. Despite the claim that Bailasan aims to "increase the amount of Palestinian information on the internet" they have removed all of the sections that promised any information leaving a 3 page site. Perhaps most indicative of their attitude towards information is their <i>Palestine Directory</i>, which looks very, very familiar. I mean - link by link, section by section familiar.  However they lack graphics, reviews or design and are out of date by about 4 months - and I even send them the updates! <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997.

PALNET's website has developed its links, although navigating through them can be a little boring, as only the titles of websites are offered with no reviews. The site also offers an interesting guide to Palestine's economy for those wanting to invest here, as well as government and business contact addresses. PALNET were at the Palestine International Festival 1996 and 1997, offering opportunities for visitors to browse the Web, and hopefully will make a reappearance this coming year.

The homepage has both K5M restaurant and Internet price menus, photos of the cafe and a list of K5M's catering services. In case you were wondering, K5M's name comes from the 6 brothers that own the restaurant - 5 of them have names starting with M and one with K. Or is it the other way round?

The website is a good current, reference point for those interested in this work and the wider work of the United Nations. Formerly attached to the Internet via the Hebrew University, UNDP now offers its service through a connection with IBM.
