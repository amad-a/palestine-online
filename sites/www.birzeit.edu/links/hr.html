<b>Academic Freedom First: <a href="http://www.birzeit.edu/aff/">http://www.birzeit.edu/aff/</a></b>
A groovy purple and black Depeche-Mode style kicks in this website for the Academic Freedom First Campaign. Based at Birzeit University, the AFF aims to win Gaza students the right to freedom of movement and education. Heaps of good information, personal testimonies, and ways you can get involved. If you want a site to please your eyes and stir your conscience - this is a good place to start. <B>Review last updated: 15 September 1998.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<b>Addameer: <a href="http://www.addameer.org">http://www.addameer.org</a></b> -
An attractively designed site with lots of information about Palestinian prisoners. This is the place to go for statistics about prisoners and their living conditions. It has campaign ideas and Arabic text available as well. They registered their own domain name in November 1998 and have really taken up the use of the web in the right way. Their webmaster tells me their hits are impressive and they are even listed under Yahoo's regional directory for Israel under human rights!Going from strength to strength.<B>Review added: 15 September 1998.

<B>Al Haq: <A HREF="http://www.alhaq.org/">http://www.alhaq.org/</A></B> - Al Haq was founded in 1979 and is one of the oldest human rights organizations in Palestine. Their website was recently launched and contains press releases, summaries of publications a useful list of links and information about their work. Al Haq also publishes a high-quality quarterly newsletter but unfortunately the last edition on the web dates from September 1998.<B>Added to Complete Guide: 5 May 1999.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<B>A.I.C. - The Alternative Information Center: <A HREF="http://aic.netgate.net">http://aic.netgate.net</A></B> - AIC is a joint Israeli-Palestinian human rights group based in Jerusalem. The AIC site has been redesigned and some more content added. Their Other Front publication has an attractive newspaper-style layout and there is also some good information on settlements to be found here. It’s a pity though they don’t include articles from their magazine News from Within - a good publication which should be on the web. <B>Review last updated: 15 September 1998.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<b>Association of 40: <a href="http://www.assoc40.org">http://www.assoc40.org</a></b>
A human rights organization active around the unrecognized Arab villages inside the 1948 borders. These villages lack basic services and infrastructure and are not recognized by the state of Israel despite the fact they are populated by thousands of Palestinians. This website is full of information and comes in three languages, Arabic, English and Hebrew. It’s attractive, the content is well-written and informative, and it has a sense of humour- see for example the comment "A lot of text, huh? well, we have a lot of problems." Nice.<B>Review last updated: 15 September 1998</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

This really is a great website - a wealth of resources, attractively designed, regularly updated. They are also building an on-line Oral History section, which unlike other sites that promise the same, actually contains content. Here’s a tip for organizations which have websites - content wins out in the end.

<B>B'Tselem, the Israeli Center for Human Rights in the Occupied Territories: <A HREF="http://www.btselem.org">http://www.btselem.org</A></B>  - B'Tselem  may not at first glance seem to qualify for an inclusion in the "Complete Guide to Palestine's Websites". However, the organisation employs Palestinian field workers and works almost exclusively on human rights violations resulting from the military occupation.  The site contains lists of reports, studies, case studies, press releases, and other publications with a form to request them to send these publications  to you through the mail. They used to offer downloadable reports online but for reasons unknown decided to stop that. It's a pity as that's what websites are for! <B>Added to Complete Guide: 12 November 1996 / Review last updated: 2 September 1999.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<B>Free Ahmad Qatamesh!: <A HREF="http://www.freeqatamesh.org/">http://www.freeqatamesh.org/</A></B> - The first Palestinian political prisoner to have his own homepage, Ahmad Qatamesh has been in prison without trial or charge for five years. Ahmad is a writer and you will find "Forever Human", an anthological collection of Ahmad’s prison writings on a variety of topics, including conversations with his interrogators, his experiences during torture, his thoughts on education, ethics, women, and sexual love, as well as children's stories, and letters to his daughter Haneen. All this in addition to all of the usual information one would expect to find on a website like this. Attractively designed, this is the Complete Guide's March 1998 website of the month. <B>Added to Complete Guide: 7 March 1998.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<B>Human Rights Action Project, Birzeit University: <A HREF="/hrap/index.html">http://www.birzeit.edu/hrap</A></B>  - Birzeit's Human Rights Action Project, founded in 1977, has followed the case of every student, faculty and staff member detained by the Israeli military authorities, as well as "cases of restriction orders, house raids, deportation, and denial of freedom of movement and travel as it relates to university and academic activities".  The website offers a link to the university's Human Rights and Press Release Archives, depositories of publications and press releases by the project and Birzeit's Public Relations Office, concerned with human rights issues. Monthly stats of students in Palestinian Authority and Israeli prisons are available. An excellent feature website on the problems of Gazan students studying in the West Bank, <A HREF="/aff/index.html">Academic Freedom First</A>, can also be found here, offering a photo gallery, background information and an activists section. <B>Review last updated: 18 December 1997.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

Israeli violations [of the Geneva Convention]" and all the flyers have been published online.

According to their website " We have learnt that there is only one correct response to another person's suffering, and that is that one must actually get up and go over to the person suffering to help him. Help offered and given is a matter of a fundamental option in one's life: one must make a decision to act: it is an act of the will. Feeling sorry for someone is not enough. Action is what counts."
