Traveling with the ATG is intended to give insight into how people in the Holy Land think, work and live." The ATG can arrange meetings with scientific, poltical, religious and social organisations, from Palestinian and Israeli backgrounds. Info about student, tourist and volunteer trips is available with sample itineraries, a list of Palestinian organisations and associations, a collection of photos for the alternative tourist, and a Roots section, under construction, offering "discover your roots" tours to various agegroups of Diaspora Palestinian youth and reactions from people who have been on the tours. <B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 January 1998.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

<B>Birzeit University, Around Birzeit: The Ramallah Online Travel Guide: <A HREF="/ramallah">http://www.birzeit.edu/ramallah</A></B> - Happily adopted by Birzeit University as part of its own website, this online travel guide researched, written and HTMLed by 1995/96 Birzeit Palestine and Arabic Studies student Ann Snow offers the most up-to-date travel information on what to do in the region around Birzeit University. The villages of Birzeit, Jiffna, Ein Kenya and Taybeh, as well as the more central cities of Ramallah and Al-Bireh get a  mention. More detail than <I>any</I> existing travel guide book, <I>Lonely Planet</I> and other book guides would be wise to beat a path to her door and ask for permission to use her material. Judging by their coverage of the West Bank, ranging from "we didn't think it was safe to send people there so we haven't written anything for 5 years" to the tiresome "Israel built Birzeit University" garbage, it is a matter of utmost international urgency. The guide includes information about museums, art galleries and cultural centres, hotels, shops and restaurants, going as far in some cases as to include complete menus! Unlikely to be supplanted by anything else in the near future, that's a cert. A definite Golden Olive. To be updated in early 1998. <B> Review last updated: 21 December 1997.</B> <A HREF="#top">Top of page.</A></FONT><BR><BR><BR>

Its main goals are to "promote awareness of the importance of the Palestinian cultural heritage, and help protect it; and promote cultural tourism in Palestine, local and international, through scientific research, public education and awareness programs, and through organizing guided tours to tourist and cultural attraction sites in Palestine."

The concept of each tour, itinerary and questions and answers you might have are all available, including a FAQ about your safety concerns. Yes, you'll be safe.  Thanks to this webmaster for adding relevant links to other travel sites. A nice job and a site to watch for information on the coming Bethlehem 2000 celebrations.
