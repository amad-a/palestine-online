<A NAME="ams"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.arabcare.com/">Arabcare Medical Services: http://www.arabcare.com/</A> - </B> Arabcare has recently launched a great webpage, which promises to move out of the construction stage into something very entertaining. The homepage literally bustles with life, with animated gifs leaping all over the place. Good material on the organisation and staff already exists, with more to come.<FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 6 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="cec"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.planet.edu/~cec">Central Election Commission: http://www.planet.edu/~cec</A> - </B> The aim of the CEC homepage is "to provide a concise and up-to-date information source about the Palestinian elections". The website includes articles, election timetables and results from the national elections held at the beginning of 1996. There is also information on the consituencies, electorial register, national council and president, the procedure for Jerusalem, election observers, and the electorial law. Simple, but informative. It has recently disappeared off the Planet website, even though a link remains on Planet's homepage. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 5 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="jwu"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.planet.edu/~jwu">Jerusalem Water Undertaking (Ramallah District): http://www.planet.edu/~jwu</A> - The JWU offers its 1995 annual report, information about its installations, how to apply for employment and details of its services. A humerous graphic of a dancing water drop and a clear layout tells us its not all just sewers and pipes at JWU, on this well executed site. Just the fact that this company decided to go on-line earned it a Golden Olive Award! The rest was a bonus.

<A NAME="pcbs"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.pna.org/pcbs/">Palestinian Central Buureau of Statistics: http://www.pna.org/pcbs/</A> - A new website with a nice selection of statistics from the Occupied Territories. When reviewing it, I went to what I know about - education - and was fascinated by the evidence of closure demonstrated by the high numbers of students in in the under-resourced Gaza Strip universities. Pick your topic and seek knowledge! More websites like this please. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 18 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pmh"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.palnet.com/health/maanr.htm">Palestinian Ministry of Health (Nablus): http://www.palnet.com/health/maanr.htm</A> - The Palestinian Ministry of Health (Nablus) has surfaced on PALNET via two reports that make interesting reading, concerned with the impact of the Israeli policy of closure on access to health services for Palestinians. A number of statements on the end-September clashes around the West Bank now appear on the site. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pnamininf"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.pna.org/">Palestinian National Authority, Ministry of Information: http://www.pna.org/</A> - The first PNA general information website but no longer the official one. It's import has decreased since the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation website at www.pna.net came online. Information on this website, however, is available in Arabic and English. Spelling and layout could use some work. Actually, a lot of work. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 13 January 1997 / Review updated: 3 June 1997.</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pna"><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.pna.net/">Palestinian National Authority Official Website: http://www.pna.net/</A> -  The official PNA website from the Ministry of Planning and International Cooperation. Excellent layout and information on this website. Articles, reports, statements and speeches about the country, the peace process, business opportunities, jobs and more, with much more obviously in the pipeline. Rumour has it that this website - managed by a five-person team - was established by presidential decree after Yasser Arafat saw the equivalent Israeli Ministry of Foreign Affairs website online one day. It doesn't yet have the breadth of information available on the MFA site, as it is early days yet, but I am confident that it will. It does, however, have a search engine, which is very useful. If you are publishing information about Palestine on the Web, this must be a definite "related sites" link as well as, of course, the Complete Guide to Palestine's Websites! The arrival of such a high-quality PNA website is greeted with delight by all of us working on the Internet in Palestine. Golden Olive frenzy! <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 3 June 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>
