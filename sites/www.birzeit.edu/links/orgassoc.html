<A NAME="bzsoc"></A><LI><A HREF="http://haven.iso.com/~raranki/">Birzeit Society: http://haven.iso.com/~raranki/</A> - </B> Association for those of Birzeit village, living there and abroad, that acts to keep the community together and serve its needs. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Reviewed by Nigel Parry / Added to Complete Guide: 19 May 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pcrf"></A><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"><LI><A HREF="http://www.wolfenet.com/~pcrf/">Palestine Children's Relief Fund: http://www.wolfenet.com/~pcrf/</A> - </B> The PCRF is "a registered non-political, non-profit, tax-exempt organization that was established in 1991 by concerned people in the U.S. to address the medical and humanitarian crisis facing Palestinian youths in the Middle East. It has since expanded to include other suffering children from other nationalities, based on their medical needs. The PCRF helps to locate care for children from all ethnic, religious, national and racial backgrounds. The main objective of the PCRF is to locate in the U.S. free medical care for children who cannot be adequately treated in the Middle East. The PCRF is the only organization bringing injured and sick Arab children to the U.S. for free care that is not available to them there." This is an excellently designed website, with excellent information about the PCRF and its current work and projects. What is incredible about the site is the stories of children the organisation has helped, including several injured by the Israeli army and settlers. Some very disturbing pages but well, well worth a visit to find out how you can help. A Golden Olive Award of course. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Reviewed by Nigel Parry / Added to Complete Guide: 2 August 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="pha"></A><LI><A HREF="http://home.sprynet.com/sprynet/jjadallah/">Palestinian Hemophilia Association: http://home.sprynet.com/sprynet/jjadallah/</A> - </B> The website of the Palestinian Hemophilia Association, a "non-profit organization is focusing on providing the best of medical, social, and psycho-social help to the Hemophilia community in Palestine." Based in the US, the organisation also has West Bank and Gaza Strip chapters. This English/Arabic website works in Internet Explorer if you have Arabic Windows. Brief information about this association, but navigation is difficult with unclear, distracting animated gifs the only gateway to more information.
