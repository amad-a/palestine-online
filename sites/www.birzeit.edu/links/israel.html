Although the Complete Guide to Palestine's Websites is primarily intended to offer links to <I>Palestinian</I> resources, this section includes Israeli websites that have been included for one or more of the following reasons: extensive and relevant English-language content; a significant contribution to understanding Israeli culture; and/or insight into the peace process. Although Israeli webmasters are welcome to suggest sites, all links here are added at the discretion of the Birzeit webmaster. Links to search engines specialising in Israeli websites have been offered below for those who wish to explore this part of the Internet more thoroughly.</P>

<A HREF="http://www.biu.ac.il/">Bar-Ilan University: http://www.biu.ac.il/</A> - Bar-Ilan is an institution with a religious foundation that has been accused of being a breeding ground for fanatical Israeli right-wing opinion. If you are tempted to search their website for any mention of "Yigal Amir", the now ex-student who assassinated Yitzhak Rabin, however, you will be disappointed. <B>Reviewed by Nigel Parry / Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.geocities.com/TimesSquare/5432/index.html">Israel Prison Service: http://www.geocities.com /TimesSquare/5432/index.html</A>
 - This unofficial site for the Israel Prison Service greets you with a counter, saying "You are inmate number  ### "visiting" here....(since Sept. 26, 1996)." The site stresses that all the information included is culled from official IPS releases. The information in the site does NOT include information and data from military prisons, and omits the 4,000+ Palestinians held as political prisoners in Israeli jails. And now for some fun stats included in the site (from May 1997): of the 6,716 Israelis in prison, only 11.5% serve sentences longer than 10 years, and most were convicted of drug (21%) and property (33.2%) offences. Of 1,781 West Bank & Gaza residents, 58.9% serve sentences greater than 10 years, and 70.2% were convicted of "Security offences." <B>Reviewed by Michael O'Neill / Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.ariga.com/bibiwatch/">BibiWatch: http://www.ariga.com/bibiwatch/</A> - BibiWatch, run by Israeli left-winger Eric Lee, is one man's crusade against Benyamin "Bibi" Netanyahu. Eric goes after Bibi with the same kind of gleeful dedication as a terrier chasing a weasal into its burrow. Daily diatribes make uncomfortable points that I am convinced would cause Bibi to lose sleep, that is, if he had any time to surf the Web instead of dealing with his latest corruption scandal. Lee was the organizer of the <A HREF="http://www.ariga.com/bibiwatch/blackout.htm">Israeli Internet Blackout</A> on 29 May 1997. Michael has taken to whining that the site isn't as funny as the name would suggest. I agree. <B>Reviewed by Nigel Parry / Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.haaretz.co.il/eng/">Ha'aretz: http://www.haaretz.co.il/eng/</A>
 - <I>Ha'aretz </I>may not have the widest circulation among Hebrew dailies, but it has always been considered the leading intellectual Hebrew daily. It's pages are rich with columns and articles written by Israel's foremost academics and politicians, but if you don't read Hebrew, you're out of luck. That is, until now. <I>Ha'aretz's</I> new website features English translations of top news stories and a handful of editorials and op-ed pieces. The unbiased news coverage is also a relief after reading the less-than-balanced pages of the<I> Jerusalem Post</I> (see below). Of course, a photo or two would be a nice addition to the text, but let's not be picky. A must for daily coverage of events in the region. <B>Reviewed by Michael O'Neill / Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.jpost.co.il/">Jerusalem Post: http://www.jpost.co.il/</A> - 
<A HREF="http://www.zdnet.com/yil/content/yahoo/10000580.html">Yahoo described</A> the <I>Jerusalem Post's</I> site as "the most polished of the foreign news sites we saw, provid[ing] thorough and even-handed weekly news coverage of Israel and the Middle East." The site is rated the 6th most visited site world-wide and its number of hits per annum reaches the tens of millions. As a regular reader of the <I>Post's</I> print edition, I find this a bit disheartening. The paper could only be considered even-handed by members of the Likud Party (e.g. the weather map's political boundaries don't recognize a difference between the West Bank, Gaza or the Golan. Only the Golan and East Jerusalem have been annexed as part of Metropolitan Israel). As for polished, well... I always get a kick out of finding the rare typo or grammar error in the <I>New York Times</I>. With the <I>Post</I>, the complete lack of properly edited text gets rather tiring. But you read it because you have to. There's not much else in English here. <B>Reviewed by Michael O'Neill / Added to Complete Guide: 17 May 1997</B><BR><BR>

<A HREF="http://www.jreport.virtual.co.il/">Jerusalem Report: http://www.jreport.virtual.co.il/</A> - A weekly magazine published by those who bailed out of the <I>Jerusalem Post</I> when it got taken over by right-wing Canadian Conrad Black. I can't put my hand on my heart and say it's vastly better than the <I>Post</I>, although it's certainly a little better. I think my problem is a lack of enthusiasm. <B>Reviewed by Nigel Parry / Added to Complete Guide: 12 February 1998</B><BR><BR>

 MERIA is a publication of the Begin-Sadat centre for Strategic Studies, a department of Bar-Ilan University, Israel. A rare find in Israeli sites - well-informed, interesting analysis and open to suggestions and contributions. They send out a free monthly report by e-mail that contains articles on the Middle East from a wide variety of sources including Palestinian and Arab scholars. Other useful features include a selection of free books, and articles spanning 20 years which analyse US policy in the Middle East. Oh - they also gave a plug for <a href="http://www.birzeit.edu/outloud">Birzeit OutLoud</a> in their November 1998 issue.<B>Reviewed by Adam Hanieh / Added to Complete Guide: 2 December 1998</B><BR><BR>

This site provides all sorts of information about Hebron's history, the current political situation through the eyes of the settler community, and tourism opportunities.
