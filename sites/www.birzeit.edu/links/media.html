<A NAME="amin"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.amin.org">Arab Media Internet Network - AMIN (in Arabic and English): http://www.amin.org</A> - AMIN is part service provider/part "Web Help Group", if that is an acceptable term. Designed to help Palestine's media get on the Web, it is responsible for giving Al-Quds, Al-Ayyam and Al-Bilad the start that the first two seem to have taken off with in a relatively short time. There are other links as well as to these newspapers. Best to say that AMIN is very much a growing concern and one to keep our eyes on for good things. I had avoided giving them a Golden Olive so far as I reckon that 1997 will be their true vintage year, so here it is. <FONT COLOR=RED>AMIN head Daoud Kuttab was recently arrested and released by the Palestinian Authority and the website contains information about this incident. </FONT><FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 28 May 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>


<A NAME="ayam"><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.al-ayyam.com">Al-Ayyam Newspaper (in Arabic): http://www.al-ayyam.com</A> - Same idea as Al-Quds Online. Al-Ayyam's circulation is around 5,000 and it's website offers the day's news and a clean layout and presentation. Some people here prefer Al-Ayyam because it offers a more independent outlook than Al-Quds. See for yourself. Another <I>mabrook</I> is due to this excellent project.  <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>

<A NAME="alhayat"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.alhayat-j.com/">Al-Hayat Al-Jadedah Online (in Arabic): http://www.alhayat-j.com/</A> - Al-Hayat is another local Palestinian newspaper that has recently come online. Nice design sense clear in this simple graphical interface.<FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 16 January 1997, URL updated: 6 February 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR CLEAR=RIGHT>


<A NAME="alquds"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.alquds.com">Al-Quds Online (in Arabic): http://www.alquds.com</A> - Al-Quds is the Palestinian newspaper with the largest circulatation, numbering around 25,000. The website offers Arabic via graphics (suitable for all) option. Al-Quds Online's material, fresh each day, includes a selection of news, comment and cartoons, all delivered in a striking layout that doesn't take as long to load as one might think. A valuable contribution to the Palestinian Web World, hosted on the PALNET server. <I>Mabrook ilkum</I>.  <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 17 November 1996</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>


<A NAME="diary"></A><A HREF="goldeno.html"><IMG HEIGHT=96 WIDTH=94 ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 HSPACE=10 VSPACE=10 SRC="images/goldeno.gif"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.birzeit.edu/diary">A Personal Diary of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict, by Nigel Parry: http://www.birzeit.edu/diary</A> - My own website, I come clean, but I'll review it anyway and give it one of those Olive things just to let people see the power of knowing the right people. The Personal Diary has become more of an alternative media/magazine website than a personal homepage, if you were wondering why this review has moved sections. The diary logs the realities of the peace process primarily after the Oslo 2 redeployment in the area where I live and work - the Palestinian Area A town of Ramallah, the Area B village of Birzeit and the Birzeit University community. Confused by all these A's and B's? Tell me about it! With photos and regular entries, this has been a fascinating project to work on. It's worth will increase as the entries do, currently numbering around 60. During the late September 1996 clashes that turned into a mini-war between Israeli soldiers and Palestinian Police, a lot of harrowing entries were added, over 2,000 visitors dropped by in a two-week period, and several newspapers and magazines reported on the diary. Most recent was the Abu Ghnaim Diary section. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Review last updated: 22 May 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>  

<A NAME="tjt"></A><LI><A HREF="http://www.amin.org/biladi.htm">The Jerusalem Times - Biladi (in English): http://www.amin.org/biladi.htm</A> - The Jerusalem Times is Palestine's only English-language newspaper. The website used to contain all the articles from the weekly publication and was worth a visit. It was simple to navigate, fast to load once you got past the homepage, and unintentionally useful in that many of the articles (of widely varying quality) were translations (not always credited) from the Arabic Press.  Unfortunately the site has not been updated since the Hebron Redeployment in February, rendering its presence on the Internet both useless and embarrassing. <FONT SIZE=2><B>Added to Complete Guide: 9 September 1996 / Review last updated: 3 June 1997</B></FONT>.<BR><BR>
