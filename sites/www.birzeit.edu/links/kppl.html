<P><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Most of the documents related to the peace process are available in a section on the webserver of the Israeli Foreign Ministry. The Palestinian Authority website has a similar section still under construction. Maps can be found in a variety of locations. <FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>

<P>The Israeli Foreign Ministry's <A HREF="http://www.israel.org/peace/index.html">Guide to the Mideast Peace Process</A> includes a guide to the bilateral and multilateral peace talks since the Madrid Conference in October 1991, a chronological list of selected basic reference documents pertaining to the Middle East peace process and details about proposed projects for cooperation in the Middle East and East Mediterranean compiled by the Government of Israel, submitted to the MENA Economic Summit held
in Cairo, November 1996</P>

<P>The Palestinian Authority's <A HREF="http://www.pna.net/peace/">Peace Process</A> section of their website includes some of the documents and information about the Palestinian Authority's Political Programme. Its <A HREF="http://www.pna.net/facts/">Facts about Palestine</A> section includes historical essays, maps, and introductions to various aspects of Palestinian society.</P>

<P>The Palestine Information Center offers <A HREF="http://www.alquds.org/palestine/peace/index.html">peace-process related documents and accompanying articles</A> as well as <A HREF="http://www.alquds.org/palestine/history/index.html">historical documents pertaining to the question of Palestine</A>.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Included if you are looking for a quick route to see what International media organisations have reported about the political negotiations during the last week. Those who want a Palestinian perspective will be disappointed at the moment as there is only one locally-produced, English-language news website. <FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>

<P>The weekly Palestinian <A HREF="http://www.jerusalem-times.com/">Jerusalem Times newspaper</A> has a website, although navigational and stylistic problems make finding what you need a little difficult.</P>

<P>See also the <A HREF="http://headlines.yahoo.com/Full_Coverage/World/Israeli___Palestinian_Conflict/">Yahoo! world news section on the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict.</A></P> 

<P><A HREF="http://www.pna.org/mininfo/">The Palestinian Ministry of Information</A> has a current <A HREF="http://www.pna.org/mininfo/press/ep_index.htm">archive of one week of their Daily Press Report</A> in English.</P>

<P>There is however, a series of local non-governmental organisations which offer press releases and news via e-mail. The most notable of these is the Jerusalem Media and Communication Centre, which offers detailed daily and weekly reports for a subscription. See the <A HREF="./listserv.html">mailing list</A> section of the Complete Guide for more details.</P>

<P><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Economic prosperity and continuing development, for the Palestinian people, is one of the keys to a successful peace process. This section offers a few key links to important information about how this is progressing. <FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/MEPP/PDIN/pdfront.html">Palestinian Development InfoNet</A> disseminates information on development assistance and reconstruction in the West Bank and Gaza for use by NGOs, the private sector, policy makers, and scholarly researchers. The PDIN website is maintained by the Interuniversity Consortium for Arab Studies (Montréal), with the support of the Arts Computer Network, McGill University, and the World Bank.</P> 

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.palecon.org/">Palestine Economic Forum</A> website offers publications including the excellent <I>Palestine Economic Pulse</I>, <I>West Bank and Gaza Update</I>, <I>Peace Economics</I>, articles and papers, and a discussion forum, which includes topics such as Public Sector Finances and Administration, International Trade, Investment, and Capital Flows, Private Sector Development, Human Resources, and Permanent Settlement Issues.</P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/mepp/unsco/unfront.html">UNSCO</A> offers <A HREF="http://www.arts.mcgill.ca/programs/polisci/faculty/rexb/directory/index.html-ssi">useful directories</A> of NGOs and Donor Country NGOs operating in the Gaza Strip.</P>

<P>See <A HREF="http://www.ipcri.org/ipcri8.html">Recommendation on Steps to be Taken With Regard to Palestinian Economic Development Needs in Relationship to Israeli Security Needs</A>, from the <A HREF="http://www.ipcri.org/">Israel-Palestine Center for Research and Information (IPCRI)</A>. It assumes Israel actually cares about Palestinians and plugs the "industrial zones" idea (read: cheap labour) but it has some good points to make.</P> 

<P>Palestine has a stock exchange! 1996 was the worst year ever for the Palestinian economy, but even in the worst of conditions, an efficient stock exchange should bring in higher investment. Indeed, the new Palestine Securities Exchange is doing its best to be efficient -- and has hopes for foreign investors from the Palestinian Diaspora, and even Israel. See <A HREF="http://www.link.co.il/57/57palstocks.htm">Securities in a time of Insecurity</A> from <A HREF="http://www.link.co.il/">LINK</A> magazine. </P>

<A NAME="borders"></A><H4><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Freedom of Movement and Borders</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>One of the major flaws of the Oslo accords (from a Palestinian perspective), closures and a lack of freedom of movement continue to sour feelings towards the peace process. <FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>

The <A HREF="/aff/index.html">Academic Freedom First</A> website, produced by the <A HREF="/hrap/index.html">Human Rights Action Project</A> at Birzeit University, offers an insight into the problems face by Gazan students who want to study in the West Bank. The control of movement, through checkpoints and a tightly-monitored permit system, is one of the biggest 'souring' influences for Joe Palestinian, who is being asked to support the peace process. Oslo has seen a worsening of this trend. </P>

<P>Some explanation of life under closure can be found in the <A

With the coming of the Palestinian Authority, a new party to potentially violate rights is on the scene. Key links to the overall situation are provided here, as well as a link to the microcosm of Birzeit University's experience.<FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>


<P><A HREF="http://www.btselem.org/">BT'selem</A> is an Israeli human rights organisation which has long worked on the issue of violations of human rights in the occupied territories.</P>

<P>Birzeit University's <A HREF="/hrap/index.html">Human Rights Action Project</A> is an excellent way of getting to grips with human rights as the community under scrutiny is that of a university with a population of only around 4,000 students. The microcosm reveals the bigger picture.</P>

<P>LAW, also mentioned in the <A HREF="#hr">human rights section above</A>, has a prisoners website entitled <A HREF="http://www.birzeit.edu/lawe/prisoner/index.html">No Peace Without Freedom</A> that deserves a visit, dealing with Israeli prisons. LAW's website can also </P>

<P><A HREF="http://www.arij.org/paleye/">Eye on Palestine</A> - a website by the Applied Research Institute-Jerusalem, looking at the development of settlements and new settlement projects across the West Bank including East Jerusalem. Annotated ariel photos and maps bring alive the realities on the ground to explain why settlements are an obstacle to a peaceful settlement, strangling Palestinian communities, taking over their agricultural land and water resources, and exposing the Palestinian population to the often violent presence of armed settlers.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.cprs-palestine.org/">Centre for Palestine Research and Studies</A> in Nablus has conducted two polls amongst Israeli settlers, the first in <A HREF="http://www.cprs-palestine.org/polls/95/setpoll1.html">December 1995</A>, and the second in <A HREF="http://www.cprs-palestine.org/polls/97/setpoll2.html">June 1997</A>.</P>

<A NAME="ground"><H4><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Finally: A sense of what it's like "on the ground"</FONT></H4>
<P><FONT COLOR=DARKBLUE>Perhaps the most important aspect of the peace process is the measure of security it brings to people on the ground. In CNN-land, people become statistics and the news seems shallow when viewed from over here. Gerald Kessel certainly doesn't live in the West Bank. These sites offer a window into a more <I>real</I> life here.<FONT COLOR=BLACK></P>


<P>The <A HREF="http://www.cprs-palestine.org/">Center for Palestinian Research and Studies</A> has a number of interesting <A HREF="http://www.cprs-palestine.org/polls/">opinion polls</A> which are well worth looking into fpor insight into how "the person on the street" sees things. Included are polls on the various stages of the peace process.</P>

<P><A HREF="/palnews/war/index.html">On the ground in Ramallah: Reports from a town become battlefield</A> - a Birzeit University staff and student website constructed "live" during the September 1996 clashes that followed the opening of a tunnel in the Old City of Jerusalem. It offers information on a variety of levels - day-by-day area chronologies, official statements, eye-witness, vox-pop quotes from Birzeit staff and students, a photo diary and links to other information from Palestinian organisations. Excellent for getting a sense of how violent events unravel, how the Israeli army responds to Palestinian demonstrations, and what the politicians say afterwards. An extraordinarily popular website that resulted in $15,000 of equipment funding for Birzeit to expand its Web reporting. </P>


<P><A HREF="/diary/index.html">A Personal Diary of the Israeli-Palestinian Conflict</A> - A photodiary by Nigel Parry from Birzeit University's Public Relations Office, a resident of the West Bank town of Ramallah since 1994. The diary attempts to explain aspects of life here for Palestinians. The diary is searchable and is organised in chronological and subject indicies, with a focus on events affecting the university community of Birzeit. Here is what the Jewish Communications Network said about the diary: "A rare opportunity to see the post-Oslo period from a jarringly anti-Israeli perspective, and yet a perspective that is mature, sensitive and stylistically compelling. Watch out, you might become addicted to this site, returning frequently to seek out new diary entries. Peace engenders communication. We like the open tone of critical respect of this site -- reflecting one view -- yet presenting a break with the implacable style of past discourse. Polished and professional."</P>
