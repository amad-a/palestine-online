              Abu Khalid, our pens are incapable of writing, our minds
              are incapable of thinking, and our tongues are incapable
              of speech. If we fill the sea with ink, it would not be
              enough to write how great you were in life. I won't cry
              for you because you are not dead inside me. My memories
              of you live on.

            <p>
              I waited for Tammam there but started to worry and
              phoned him on his mobile. A stranger's voice answered me
              telling me that the owner of this mobile was lying in
              the hospital. I arrived at the hospital to discover that
              he was dead. I uncovered him. Looked at him. Touched
              him. He was warm and I kissed him. He was my angel."

              Amin used to say to his friends, "Why do we live amongst
              stones, bullets and blood? Why do we have no
              independence and never know safety and security? We live
              amongst wild soldiers, destruction and martyrs. Are we

            <p>
              One soldier took aim and shot Yasser from a distance of
              20m. Live ammunition lodged in his heart and he was
              rushed to the hospital where they operated on him in a
              corridor in an attempt to save his life. He was placed
              in intensive care. He was the first person shot and the
              last to die, four months later in a Jordanian hospital
              on the 6th February 1997.

                clashes.
