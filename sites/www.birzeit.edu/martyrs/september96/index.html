<A HREF="stories/ramsey.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1 SRC="stories/images/gs29a.jpg"></A><P>Abu Khalid, our pens are incapable of writing, our minds are incapable of thinking, and our tongues are incapable of speech. If we fill the sea with ink, it would not be enough to write how great you were in life. I won't cry for you because you are not dead inside me. My memories of you live on.</P> 

<A HREF="stories/tammam.html"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 SRC="stories/images/wbtamam3.jpg"></A>
<P>I waited for Tammam there but started to worry and phoned him on his mobile. A stranger's voice answered me telling me that the owner of this mobile was lying in the hospital. I arrived at the hospital to discover that he was dead. I uncovered him. Looked at him. Touched him. He was warm and I kissed him. He was my angel." </P>


<A HREF="stories/amin.html"><IMG ALIGN=LEFT BORDER=1 SRC="stories/images/gs16.jpg"></A><P>Amin used to say to his friends, "Why do we live amongst stones, bullets and blood? Why do we have no independence and never know safety and security? We live amongst wild soldiers, destruction and martyrs. Are we ever going to live a happy life?"</P>


<A HREF="stories/yasser.html"><IMG ALIGN=RIGHT BORDER=1 SRC="stories/images/wbghani.jpg"></A><P>One soldier took aim and shot Yasser from a distance of 20m. Live ammunition lodged in his heart and he was rushed to the hospital where they operated on him in a corridor in an attempt to save his life. He was placed in intensive care. He was the first person shot and the last to die, four months later in a Jordanian hospital on the 6th February 1997. </P>
