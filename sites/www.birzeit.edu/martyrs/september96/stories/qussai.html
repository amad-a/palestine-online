<!-- The story, each paragraph surrounded by start and end paragraph tags please -->


<P>Qussai returned with his family to their homeland
after the Oslo Accords, in 1994. Qussai�s family lived in Yemen where his father
had been working and Qussai had grown up and finished school in Aden . After
graduation he went to Britain for 1 year where he studied English
language.</P>

<P>In 1993, Qussai joined the Palestinian Liberation Organisation and  completed several military training courses in Syria and Yemen. His friends remember him for being an excellent marksman. Although he loved to socialise, he didn�t have many friends out of the military base because he had only returned recently from Yemen.</P>

<P>When they arrived in Gaza, the family moved to the southern town of Rafah, which was under the control of the Palestinian Authority. Qussai loved his relatives dearly and did not allow the division of Gaza to prevent him from visiting them in Jabalya camp, which was still under Israeli control at the time. One day he went to Jabalya, wearing his uniform and carrying his gun. When he saw his relatives for the first time, he was so happy that he started shooting in the ai, despite the presence of Israeli troops on the borders of the camp.</P>

<P>Qussai was working on a checkpoint near Kfar Darom settlement on Thursday 26 September 1996. A large crowd of  school students and many other people were protesting and Qussai was trying with his colleagues to control the crowd. The Israelis didn�t give them a chance to clear the area before opening fire.</P>

<P>People began to  fall, either dead or injured. Qussai started quickly to help people into ambulances but even this he was not able to do as the Israeli soldiers were shooting at medical personnel. Feeling he had no option, Qussai took his gun and went to defend the unarmed Palestinians that were being killed, but was shot in the chest and died instantly. The checkpoint now holds his name and a memorial statue of him.</P>
