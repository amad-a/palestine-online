The soldier shouted to her, "Where are yougoing and why is this (her son) here." The mother replied pleading thather son was young and had nothing to do with the war. The soldier demanded themother turn over her son to them and after her refusal they grabbed him by forcefrom his mothers arms. The woman was crying and weeping desperately but to nouse. After the soldiers distanced themselves about 20 meters from the woman,they yelled at the woman saying, "You'll see why we took him." And infront of the mother's eye's the soldier raised an axe and hit the boy directly over the head, slicing his head in two and killing him instantly.

The object of the military operation was to occupythe village and deport its Palestinian inhabitants.</P><P>This was the beginning of the "unknown massacre" in which around sixtyPalestinian men, women and children were killed. A lucky few were killeddefending the village. Others, however, were rounded up after the fighting was over and shot en masse. Some were reportedly killed with axes.</P> <P>The residents of Abu Shusha witnessed the arrival of Jewish reinforcementsat the neighboring settlement of Kibbutz Gezer the day before the massacre. Everyone in the village realized with fear that their &quot;midnight hour&quot;was upon them, and that the final assault on their village was near. Theassault was to follow months of minor skirmishes between the Jewish settlers ofKibbutz Gezer and other Zionist communities in the area and Palestinianvillagers. Jewish settlers had previously suggested a non-aggression pactwith Abu Shusha. However, the main purpose of such proposals wasto play for time giving the leaders of the Haganah the space to concentratetheir military force on other fronts in the early stages of the war. The otherpurposes of such agreements was also to create deeper divisions among the villagersconcerning the agreements. The villagers of Abu Shusha had already rejected suchproposals.</P><P>At the height of the massacre, the scene in Abu Shusha was a bleak one,mirroring the general picture in Palestine at that time. On the same day--13May 1948--two days before the announcement of the independence of the State ofIsrael, and before the decision of the Arab government to send their armies toPalestine, Palestinian society was on the point of collapse.</P><P>As British soldiers prepared to evacuate the country the administrativestructures of the Mandate government crumbled. The Palestinian leadership hadnever been allowed by the British to prepare themselves to inherit the mantle ofgovernment. While the Jewish community had created a state-in-waiting, the Palestinianshad been excluded from the decision-making process and positions of power by theMandate authorities. This situation led to a sense of anarchy in Palestiniancircles, uncertainty about the future and a vacuum in the political leadershipand organizations. All these issues contributed to a growing sense of panic.</P><P>On the military front, the Palestinian were unable to mount their owndefensive. They did not possess substantial stocks of arms and ammunition. Thelevel of military organization and preparedness was almost nil. The onlyexception to this was a couple of thousand armed men led by Abdul Qadral-Husseini gathered together under the banner of <i>jihad muqadis</i>(holy struggle).</P><P>The war situation, after the Deir Yassin massacre on 10 April 1948, entereda new phase. This phase was heralded by a change in Zionist militarystrategy--the threat or act of massacre--as a means of forcing many thousands ofPalestinians to flee their villages and homes in fear of their lives. Thesevillagers followed on the heels of thousands of middle-class and wealthyPalestinians who had already left their homes and moved to more &quot;secure&quot;Palestinian areas in other parts of the country.</P><P>One defeat after another, one massacre after another, fear and paniccharacterized the whole of Palestine. Thousands fled trying to protect theirown lives as well as those of their children and loved ones. On April 17th,the town of Tiberias fell amidst similar scenes of panic, and all thePalestinians were compelled to flee. Within days of this happening, a similarcourse of events took place in Haifa. Thousands of Palestinian inhabitants left. Within a week only a few thousand remained. They were moved to a singleneighborhood in the city. On 13 May 1948--when the Zionist forces were preparing tooccupy Abu Shusha--the defeated leading citizens of Jaffa signed anunconditional surrender with the forces of the Haganah.</P><P>Although the picture was bleak and consequences of the events forced thechoice of either death or exile, the residents of Abu Shusha, who then knew thefate that awaited them, arranged a meeting. They decided to stay in the villageand defend their homes and lands, and to protect the tombs and burial places oftheir forefathers.</P><P>It was not an easy decision for the village to reach. It followed a shortbut passionate debate, with the spectre of Dayr Yasin present throughout thediscussions. Some argued for an evacuation of the village, believing that theirexile would be short-lived. The majority, however, argued, for remaining in thevillage and protecting it.  The villagers then had to decide how to defendthemselves in the imminent conflict. The debate centered on twooptions: the first was to evacuate the women, children and the aged and let thefighters remain. The second option was to let the women, children and agedremain but to hid them in the village caves. The later option was chosen.</P> <P>The villagers then set about organizing themselves for the forthcomingbattle. There were about seventy rifles in the village, 20 of which wereold-fashioned muskets. The villagers also had in their possession the oldmachine gun sent by the famous Arab leader Hassan Salameh, as well as somemines. The fighters positioned themselves around the village and its borders. They began their wait filled with fear and trepidation, and some families evenattempted to flee under the cover of darkness rather than face the imminentconflict. However these families were discovered by other villagers andreturned to village.</P> <P>The assault itself began with heavy bombardment by mortars shells from theJewish artillery. Many houses and streets were damaged in the initial onslaught. By 9am, Zionist soldiers advanced on the village. The fighters of Abu Shushatried to repeal the attack, and some were killed in defense. Their lines,however, were easily broken as their arms were no match for the efficiency ofthe Zionist forces. Some of the fighters stationed on the village boundary linewere disarmed and executed by the Jewish fighters as they took the village. Other unarmed villagers fleeing to the east were captured and killed, unable todefend themselves. Once the village had been occupied, the Zionist forces beganthe process of cleansing the village of its Palestinian inhabitants. Villagerswere killed on the street or in their homes. Some were axed to death and otherswere shot. In one of the houses the Jewish fighters found a group of menand killed them with axes. In front of another house some men were lined upagainst a wall and executed. This apocalyptic scene was repeated throughout thevillage and continued until a deathly silence announced the "victory."</P><P>However this was not the end of the tragedy. Further chapters remained, asthe soldiers were informed that some villagers had hidden themselves in nearbycaves. They discovered the caves two or three days later when they found awoman forging for food in her house. The frightened women led the soldiers tothe caves where the inhabitants were order to leave. A few men hid in the farrecesses of the cave in order to escape detection, making their escape later. With fear in their eyes, squintin in the sun after days in thecaves, the remaining villagers came out of hiding. A terrible scene greeted them.The bodies of the slain fighters had been left unburied in the hot May sun. Their bodies were swollen and decomposing, maggots and flies ate their flesh. The woman saw the bodie of their relatives, their husbands, sons, brothers and uncles.</P> <P>In this terrible moment, the women faced an uncertainfuture. The only man among them was too old to help, and soldiers made him raise a white flag of surrender over the village. Thesewomen, who in the past had risen early to feed their family, who had worked in thefields, and who had laundered clothes, baked bread, and raisedtheir families, were forced to cope with organizing the burialof the dead.</P><P>The women formed a committee and asked for permission to bury the dead. They undertook the grisly task with tears in their eyes. They found itimpossible to dig in the hard ground, and there was no-one available toconduct the burial service or recite the prayers. Thus the men were buriedwhere they had fallen rather than in the village graveyard. The women threw thebodies in ditches or covered the corpses with soil and stones. The most shockingscene for them was when they reached the house where the men had been butcheredwith axes.</P><P>The tragedy continued. One soldier spotted a woman and her thirteen yearold son trying to escape. The boy was axed to death as the woman's cries formercy rang out through the air. The soldiers also killed an old woman, and mines planted by Jewish forces exploded, blowing the feet off two women.</P><P>Ironically, four hours after the massacre, the Jewish People's Council wasmeeting in Tel Aviv. Those present were there to draft the Declaration ofIndependence for the new State of Israel. In this declaration the Arab citizensof the state were promised full and equal citizenship and representation in allstate structures. However, the villagers of Abu Shusha--themselves now citizensof the new state--were denied any rights, and their forceful expulsion meant theyhad no place in the state-in-making. They were forced from lands which legallybelonged to them. They became homeless and penniless refugeescompelled to settle elsewhere.</P> <P>
