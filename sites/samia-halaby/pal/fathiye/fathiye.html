The Israelis bombed the ancient city of Sur till it seemed it could not live.  "On the following day in the evening an unconscious one month old baby arrived in the arms of his hysterical mother seeking our help.  She had left Sur with evacuees on the road by the see where Israeli planes destroyed their vehicle.  She walked for hours and hours in wild fields with her baby in her arms until she reached Damour where she found someone to bring her to our hospital.  She knew not how or if the rest of her children and husband escaped.  The baby was hit in the head in several places and needed immediate surgery."  This littlest Palestinian subject of our loving work is the youngest target of Israeli terrorism. They feared him and still do.  It is called guilt and greed.
