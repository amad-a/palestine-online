<h3>MEMORIAL on the 50th Anniversary of the Kafr Qasem Massacre</h3>
<h4>The Third Wave of the Massacre</h4>
<h4>Testimony of Abu Butros Amer known as Lamumba Kafr Kasem</h4>

<p>

Interview with Abu Butros Amer who was a witness to part of the massacre.  Abu Butros was
ill at the time of the interview and needed to lay down several times.  He died a few years
later. I recorded this testimony in Kafr Qasem on November 8, 1999 at his home.*  

<p>

After I told Abu Butros that I was interested in details and in the historical facts not 
in fiction he told me that he himself has no respect for those who invent out of their 
own minds.  After hearing his testimony, I resolved to redo this watercolor below based
on earlier limited knowledge.
<p>

<img src="third/third.jpg"><br>
<b>The Shepherd Uthman Isaa and his son Fathi Isaa</b>

<p>

We began talking about the shepherd Uthman Isaa.  I had told him what I had heard from 
other Kafr Qasemites already.  He said:  �The son was killed.  He was killed first.�  In 
seeking to develop a mental picture, I asked later how the son fell and if his body 
flew in the air from the power of the bullets.  Abu Butros said:  �He just collapsed on 
the ground, he just went down.  They all shot at him at the same time even the Bryn.  
There were three weapons aimed at that boy.  The Bryn, the Oozy, and a shotgun (barude).  
Ba ba ba ba ba ba (he made the sound of the automatic repeat shooting of the Bryn) they 
rained the bullets at him.�

<p>

�There were three soldiers doing the killing including the captian Malenki who had the 
Oozy.  One more came in a Jeep.�

<p>

I asked about the color and makeup of the goats.

<p>

�The flock was of black goats.  They were their own goats.  The family owned nearly 
a thousand goats.  The herd that day was much more than a hundred black goats.  They 
were all black. [When Kafr Qasemites talk about the family, they mean the extended family
consisting of one to four hundred people or more.]

<p>
We were stopped.  Our truck was stopped on the right hand side of the road and the 
shepherd and his flock were walking on the left hand side of the road, on the lower red 
soil.  It was wilderness and empty at that time. The son was in the front of the herd and 
the father in the back.  They were passing us in the same direction homeward that we wanted.  
They were going opposite of the shooting coming at them.  The flock [reacting to the shooting] 
then turned and ran backward, in the direction they had been coming from, that is back toward us.
The father who was in the back of
the flock, instead of running with them to escape the shooting, began to run forward and to shoo 
the goats trying to get them back on track.  They Israelis killed him. 

<p>

They had shot and killed the boy when he had come nearly abreast of them (at the point 
where the memorial stone is located now).  When they shot at the boy our driver stopped 
the truck and turned off the engine.  I was sitting on the left side and saw how they 
shot the boy and father.  I saw it all clearly.  We all began to believe that we would all 
die; and so one person said that that was it and that we should prepare ourselves; and so 
many of us prayed and recited the <i>Fatiha</i> and believed completely that we too would 
all be killed.

<p>
	
We were stopped.  The jeep came and stopped, one of them stood on the jeep and 
aimed the gun at us in the open back of the truck.  One, Malenki, stood at the door 
of the truck to the right opposite the driver with his elbow on the window where 
Muhammad Said, known as Abu Ruda, was seated next to the driver.  Abu Ruda was wearing 
an <i>umbaz</i> and a <i>hatta</i> and <i>igale</i> and he was a heavy man. [Abu Ruda was
wearing the traditional robe and headdress of a Palestinian Village.]

<p>

�Malenki asked:  (�Fein kanyeen� ) �Where were you?� and the Abu Ruda answered �At work 
sir� (Fil-�amal ya sidi)��  I asked Abu Butros if in fact Abu Ruda being older than 
Malenki did in fact use the term �sidi� in talking to him and Abu Butros assured me 
that he did.  Abu Butros continued,  �Then Malenki said:  �If you want to live, then all 
of you go to one house. Follow me� The driver, Abd Allah Isma�il asked, �Shall we go in 
front of you or follow you Sir�  and he answered �In front of me�  And so they turned on 
the motor and proceeded.   Our truck moved on and no one shot at us.  Our wheels were not 
shot.  They were whole.�

<p>

I had been given an earlier description by another survivor of this truck and he had 
said that the slow ride was very bumpy and that they were going over dead bodies.  So 
I asked Abu Butros if the wheels where shot off and made the ride bumpy or if they had 
driven over bodies  He said:  �We did not drive over bodies.�

<p>

�By then there were four already dead beside the boy and his father, they are Ghazi, 
Abu Samaha, Abdal Raheem Al Sameer and Ahmad AlSous.  Mahmoud AlSous had run away and 
escaped. The soldiers (doing the killing) were two standing and one lying on the ground 
with the Bryn.  When the jeep came it was the third soldier.  There were three all 
together doing the killing�

<p>

I asked what they where wearing and the entire family answered that the workers in the 
back were all wearing work clothes with the exception of one man in the back who was 
wearing an Umbaz.  (probably abu Samaha since he was a trader)  The work clothes of 
the time were heavy and course cotton Kaki of a dark color.  I asked if it was the color 
of the dark Kaki that the British soldiers then wore and Abu Butros said:  �Yes, exactly.�
  I asked about the hat the workers wore and if any wore a <i>hata wa igale</i> coming home from 
work and he said no.  We discussed the hat that many of the workers wore and we drew it 
until it seems that I understood how it was and Abu Butros had described it as the Arab 
hat except a bit bigger and deeper.  So it was a rounded cone fitting to the scull but with 
a band at the bottom. (see notebook)

<p>

Abu Butros told me that in those days the plains were planted with wheat and that watermelon 
was still very little planted as it was brought to the area only in 1953.  
<p>

of killing as they plead with the soldiers, and later as she falls in the collective
embrace in death of the women.</b>
<p>

Then I asked about Wednesday October 31, 1956, when everyone went out for the first time 
after the long curfew, searching for what happened.  Abu Butros had told me that his 
mother was in the last and final wave of the killing and had died in it; and that his 
brother had escaped the first wave of the killing, This uncle being the paternal unkle of 
Rose Amer.  Abu Bustros said:  �On Wednesday, of course, every one went out searching, 
looking and asking.  We looked for remains of my mother and we found her grey Abaye which 
she wore over her clothes and we found both her shoes.�  

<p>

I asked the color of the Abaye and they had said grey and I asked if they saved the 
clothes and they said of course but that now they do not know where they are.  At that 
point Rose interjected that:  �My uncle always kept the pants he wore that day and in the 
pants was two bullet holes where the bullet had gone in and come out.�  She then pointed 
to the spot behind the knee where the bullet went in and out without injuring her Uncle.

<p>

Rose�s paternal uncle was a quarry worker and he is black like this entire Amer family.  
Rose Amer had told me earlier that her father being very political and active was 
called Lamumba Kafr Qasem.  He then told me that he wanted to avenge his mother and 
immediately became an activist. And that the military judge used to call him that.

<p>

The uncle�s name is Mustafa Khamees Amer known as Abu Injeem.  When he was injured he 
ran in the direction of the sea and eventually went to Jaljulia and hid for two days.

<p>

I asked Abu Butros if his brother when he returned from Jaljulia was able to speak and 
tell what happened to him, he answered that all was normal with his ability to 
talk to them.

<p>
<img src="third/Rose Amer.jpg"><br>
<b>Rose Amer, daughter of Abu Buros AKA Lumumba Kafr Qasem</b>
<p>

While waiting for Abu Butros at his home, I recorded what his daughter, Rose Amer, told me.

<p>

Rose said that the area of the massacre was called Al-Filmaya but that she does not know 
what the name means or why the area is called thus.  She told me exactly where the last 
wave of killing took place.  It was exactly at the spot where I had first met her on the 
right side of the street which leads into the village from the main road right at the 
crossing of the monument.

<p>

Rose Amer and her mother talked with me, Im Beatrice
spoke to me about the massacre.  [The name Im Beatrice means in English, mother of 
patrice which is the name given her son in admiration of Patrick Lamumba.] Im Beatrice 
said that she was not in the massacre 
as she was born in 1948 and as a child she came to consciousness as a refugee.  At one 
time they were in the refugee camps around Nablus. 

<p>

In regards to the massacre of 1956, Rose said that her father told them that all the 
roads and pathways coming into the village were closed with the exception of those to 
the east of the town leading to Jordan.  She said that they had closed everything except 
to the east hoping that the killing and the terror would frighten people into packing 
up and abandoning their homes to the Israelis.

<p>

Rose said that her father was in the same truck as Abu Sameeh and that they saw the 
massacre.  It was the truck that escaped.  She said that they saw the Shepherd and 
his son being massacred.    The father and others in the truck had talked about how 
the driver was afraid of being fined and that he asked some of the passengers to get 
out and to walk.  Some did get out and decide to walk and her father being 17 wanted 
to do the same but then they heard the shooting and they promised the driver that 
they would divide the price of the fine among them and pay him if he were fined.  
Thus, it is told by Rose, that they got back in the truck and drove.

<p>

Rose said that they saw the sheep coming and that they saw the little shepherd boy die.  
First they killed the son and the sheep began running toward the truck and the father 
was shooing them and he did not see his son had been shot.  He was only paying 
attention to the sheep coming suddenly at him.  
<p>
Then Dihan stopped them and asked questions, he let them go and he followed them 
with his jeep.
<p>
The people in the truck saw the shepherds and his son die.  The father had gone to 
get the son in the field and to get him to hurry home.  And, as the boy was in the 
front and the father in the back shooing the sheep, the son was shot first the 
father second.
<p>
She said that her father claims that Abu Sameeh is mistaken in saying that the truck 
drove over bodies.
