	I have given you both a full color and a black and white of each so that you can select
what looks better to you.
<p>
	There are 5 sets.  The first batch is done on my Kinetic painting program which I wrote 
for my own use in performance with musicians..  The next set hand drawn using the mouse as single 
images.  The Third set is high-resolution photo images taken from the screen.  The fourth set 
is a couple of images taken from kinetic paintings done in the mid 80's on the Amiga.  And the 
last is a a series of self portraits done over a period of time on the web
allowing people to view the development of the drawing.
