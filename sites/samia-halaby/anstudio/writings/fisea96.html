SUMMARY:  This paper focuses on kinetic abstraction as a painting expression 
appropriate to computing.  It begins by describing the futuristic ambitions 
of early twentieth-century painters to create movement.  The way in which 
the forms of computing fulfills those ambitions is substantiated by comparing 
the two kinds of art.  The third section presents some of the artists who 
program paintings.
<hr>
	Painters who consider computing find two directions of work possible. 
On the one hand they can use it to support and automate work in other media.  
On the other, they can use computing as a medium for new work.  
<p>
	Painters study a new medium because they intuit that it can hold new 
content better than old media.  Once understood, materials are applied to 
create visual forms(1) that themselves hold the meaning of a painting.  The 
essential search, then, is into painting itself.  By using computers, 
painters might push the art of painting into new realms, and in so doing, 
they would cause computing to mature as a visual medium.
<p>
	When painters examine computing as a medium they find a striking 
resemblance to abstraction.  It echoes the writings of artists from 
the first decades of the twentieth century.  It has potential for visual 
motion noisy enough to fulfill their most futuristic dreams.  In this paper, 
the realization of s such a form is called kinetic abstraction.
<p>
	Before the development of abstract form, many musicians/inventors 
hoped to create visual music.  They felt that music had a hidden visual 
reality that they might externalize.  Late in the nineteenth century, 
Alexander Wallace Rimington built a piano like machine which he called the 
"Colour-Organ."  It was electric and its fourteen-octave keyboard was 
connected to lens and filters and ark lamps.  It projected only colored 
light and did not produce sound but  was accompanied by a piano in 
performance.  It was so remarkable that as many as one thousand people 
attended a private demonstration in London in 1895.(2)
<p>
	In 1922, after the development of abstract form, in the early 
decades of the century, Thomas Wilfred performed on his own color-organ 
called the Clavilux.  It had taken ten years to perfect at an exorbitant 
expense.  What was extraordinary about the Clavilux was that it projected 
moving colored shapes and was intended as a visual show, independent of 
music, even though it was often accompanied by musical performance.  
Wilfred composed special pieces for his organ.  One reviewer described 
such a performance as "an Arabian night of color, gorgeous, raging, 
rioting color... lances of light darted across the screen to penetrate 
shields of scarlet or green or purple."(3)  Wilfred is the first inventor 
whose experiments matured enough that he might be seen as the first kinetic 
abstractionist.
<p>		
<h3>THE INNOVATORS OF ABSTRACTION</h3>
<p>
	The first abstractionists created a form that departed from the 
illusionism(4)  perfected by Renaissance painters.  Many Cubists, Futurists, 
Orphists, Rayonists, Suprematists, Constructivists, members of DeStijl, 
and other associated groupings felt driven to write about their discoveries. 
<p>
	Although their ideas are imprecise and often contradictory, the 
tone of their essays is exciting. They understood better those ideas which 
they rejected than those which they were developing.  They rejected the past 
which is easier to know than the future.  They embraced the modern world of 
technology and industry as Unberto Boccioni wrote "The opening and closing 
of a valve creates a rhythm just as beautiful but infinitely newer than the 
blink of an animal eye."(5) They stressed that painting was based on reality.  
<p>
	Movement and time were central themes.  Words and phrases such as 
pictorial dynamism,"  "Rhythmic Simultaneity," , "vibration," "go round and 
round the object,"(6) "speed," "action," "quest for space," "the fourth 
dimension,"(7) and many others like them are mentioned often in their essays.  
Rendering things frozen as seen from a stationary viewing eye, did not 
fulfill their wish to depict the motion and noise of industrial cities.  
They wanted to open the second eye(8) and put both in motion.(9)  
<p>
	In Du Cubisme written in 1912, Jean Metzinger and Albert Gleizes 
write "Today painting in oil allows us to express notions of depth, density, 
and duration supposed to be inexpressible, and incites us to represent, in 
terms of complex rhythm, a veritable fusion of objects, within a limited 
space."(10)  In The Realistic Manifesto Naum Gabo asserts "We affirm in these 
arts a new element, the kinetic rhythms, as the basic forms of our perception 
of real time."(11)  The Futurists talked about sound and wanted  their paintings 
to be noisy.  They supported a new futurist music as Umberto Boccioni wrote, 
"We do not draw sounds, but their vibrating intervals."(12)
<p>
	The pioneers of abstraction were enthusiastic about the future.  
Supporting the revolutionary hopes of the working class, they point to those 
new ideas that have given optimism to our entire century.  Although they 
created a profound renewal in form and content they could not do so for the 
technology of painting.  Until the advent of the computer the only technology 
available to painters for the creation of abstract movement, alone or with 
sound, was the color organ or mechanical animation  -- the latter recorded 
on film.  Those methods invited limited exploration by painters. 
<p>
<h3>COMPUTING'S POTENTIAL FOR ABSTRACTION</h3>
<p>
	Computing is an adaptable technology.  It can mimic different media 
and replace their more primitive technologies.  In word processors and spread 
sheets, the software designer provides simulations of the tools of creative 
writing and bookkeeping.  Paint programs simulate the tools of easel 
painting.  When we are given an icon of a brush or a pen or a spray can, 
we are supposed to make believe that the mouse is like its predecessors.  
<p>
	As painters who explore, understanding the potential of the computer 
without the mimicry of software has high value even though this value will 
serve a distant future.  It is important to understand that the computer 
can be made to behave as though it had a lens in it.  It does not.  Making 
it behave that way to creates three-dimensional illusions through software 
is very important to production but not to the explorations of painters.
<p>
	The monitor produces flat color and infinite space more readily than 
it can produce perspective and shading.  And what is even more, these colors 
are actually luminous.  When turned on, an empty screen resembles the space 
of the sky in that it does not appear limited by perspective.  We do not 
feel that we are looking at a wall but into something seemingly infinite.  
Luminous flat color and infinite backgrounds are primary parts of the visual 
language of abstraction.  Robert Delaunay described the new space as 
"endowed with vastness (we see as far as the stars)."(13)
<p>
	Visually the monitor is a descendent of television which is a 
descendent of video.  In historical order, the antecedents of video are 
film, photography, and finally painting.  In painting the frame is a window 
through which we see the world.  The boundaries of a visual work of art are 
the most basic and most significant of its formal methods.
<p>
	The relationship of abstraction to the rectangle of the picture is 
a difficult one.  As both abstraction and the monitor descend from three-
dimensional illusionism, they inherited the rectangle as window frame.  
Since abstraction does not utilize single views then the rectangle as a 
window, through which we look while stationary, contradicts the dynamism of 
abstract space.  These issues have been with abstraction since its 
beginnings.(14)  They are issues that future electronic technology might help 
us solve.  The development of  high-quality LCD panels of large size, for 
example, might soon become available.  I can imagine a kinetic painting on 
several panels of non rectangular shape.
<p>
	When we look at programming form we find a language that resembles 
modern life.  It is electronic and mathematical, making it similar to our 
culture today which includes all production, cities, distribution, and 
transportation.  The resemblance is not accidental; it lies in what is 
intrinsic to both.  For example, a function is like a factory: raw numbers 
or raw materials go in, work takes place, products come out.  The essence of 
programming is much like the essence of the modern world which the first 
abstract artists sought to express. 
<p>
	The simplest graphics commands construct images reminiscent of 
early abstraction.  They create a line out of a set of sequenced dots and 
a shape from sequenced lines.  As they are created the very heart of 
contructivist formal aesthetics is realized.  In 1912 David Burliuk wrote, 
"Painting is colored space.  The simplest element of space is the point.  
Its consequence is line.  The consequence of line is surface."(15)  
<p>
	What is important to abstraction is that these images lack 
perspective and shading and while the program runs they impart an illusion 
of motion.  Abstract motion does not rely on the geometric relationship of 
the viewing eye directed to a perpendicular picture plane.  Optics and the 
lens in film and video do the work of the viewing eye of perspective.  Thus 
the possibility of animated images, freed from the formal dictates of a  
lens, is a critical condition for kinetic abstract space.  Animated motion 
through a lens produces a kinetic three-dimensional space.  The two are 
different. 
<p>
	In 1920 Paul Klee wrote "When a dot begins to move and becomes a 
moving line, this requires time.  Likewise, when a moving line produces a 
plane, and when moving planes produces spaces."(16)  Motion itself and not 
simply the illusion of motion in a static painting, was on the mind of 
many of the early abstractionists.  
<p>
	In the mid 1980s the Amiga was capable of producing sound.  A 
combination of electronic sound and picture has the potential to realize 
new forms.  We as painters can now look at the world knowing that later 
when we paint, we will be searching our intuitions not only for how things 
looked but how they looked and sounded simultaneously. 
<p>
	Thus the computer, with its flat luminous color and infinite space 
and its potential for moving abstract shape without the use of perspective 
and shading and without a lens, is imminently suitable for the development 
of the futuristic dreams of the earliest abstract painters.  Furthermore, 
the combination of sound commands with visual commands in one program 
particularly realizes the ambitions of the Futurist painters to represent 
simultaneously their many impressions of reality.
<p>
<h3>DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEW FORM</h3>
<p>
	Early abstractionists considered the illusion of three-dimensional 
space, perfected in the Renaissance, to be inadequate for the new historical 
task in painting.  The two formal pillars of three-dimensional space, shading 
and perspective, were not able to hold the new subject matter of a world 
in motion.  Consequently, abstract painters abandoned them.  
<p>
	Perspective was first replaced by superimposed views of objects.  As 
the artists analyzed the results, they began to see the possibilities of a 
new space(17)  and arrived at a synthesis(18) where objects seen from one 
stationary point of view disappeared.(19) 
<p>
	When illusions of stationary objects disappeared, most depth clues 
of a measurable space disappeared.  Known objects impart information of 
their specific size and establish a scale for measuring space.  Without 
them shapes lose their measurability.  They relate only to each other and 
to the background.  They become unstable and seem to move back and forth 
in space -- to "push and pull"(20) in relation to the picture plane.  
<p>
	Thus the foreshortening of shapes and diminishing size, the two 
pillars of perspective, were abandoned.  Their departure left the background 
seeming more like the sky than a wall.  The background took on a sense of  
an infinite depth rather than a hard finite surface.  The new space was 
based on the interaction of shapes on an infinite background as is defined 
by the Suprematist paintings of Kasemir Malevich.  Within this space, line 
and color and texture also changed their behavior. 
<p>
	In three-dimensional illusionism line is the outline of stationary 
objects.  In abstract painting line is a path of movement, a record of 
dynamic actions.  The pioneers recorded this new use of line.  In 1912 the 
Futurist Larinov wrote, "A ray is depicted provisionally on the surface by a 
colored line."(21)  In 1920 Paul Klee equated walking through an unplowed field 
with a line traversing a field.(22)  Umberto Boccioni called this new use "the 
dynamic line/force."(23) And Naum Gabo wrote, "We affirm the line only as a 
direction."(24)
<p>
	In the early stages of Cubism, color was not important.  A type of 
simplified shading was used to differentiate surfaces.  In Synthetic Cubism 
and later on with the clearer emergence of a truly abstract space, as in the 
paintings of Kasimir Malievich and Piet Mondrian, color became significant.  
In relation to color it is important to recognize that if the artists make 
paintings conceived in motion, then to record one instant of illumination on 
a colored surface is contradictory.  Shading contradicts abstract motion.  
In abstraction luminosity replaces illumination.(25)  
<p>
	Thus abstractionists reject shading, the venerable chiaroscuro of 
the Renaissance.  It is replaced by flat areas of color which act in 
relation to each other to create an ambiance of luminosity.(26)  In 1912, 
in a letter to August Mache, Robert Delaunay wrote "Direct observation of 
the luminous essence of nature is for me indispensable...observation of the 
movement of color."(27) Larinov wrote that the Neofuturists replaced the 
static surface of a painting with a light-colored moving one.(28)
<p>
	The elimination of the object as seen from one point of view meant 
that the content of painting changed. Literary narrative and metaphor were 
replaced by the general principles of motion that connect objects.  
Abstraction cannot paint a portrait of the rich patron but it does describe 
distribution, rhythm, growth, development, and similar motions.  It did 
provide the formal language which scientists now use for multi-dimensional 
illustration.  Thus a new world of meaning opened to abstract painters who 
clearly felt the "liberation of the Great Art of Painting from the alien 
traits of Literature."(29)    
<p>
<h3>THE INTERSECTION OF COMPUTING AND PAINTING</h3>
<p>
	Can the computer, with its potential for motion, self-luminous 
color, memory, and programming, be used to push twentieth century abstraction 
into newer formal realms not possible in static painting?  Given the formal 
history of abstraction and the present state of the art of computing, the 
answer should be yes.  They are perfectly suited.  Can kinetic abstraction 
become as useful a way of imaging the world as Renaissance illusion?  Yes! 
<p>
	It is at this point in our logic that the heart of the issue lies -- 
at the point where we have done our historical and technological homework 
and begin our work to expand the visual language.  As we learn to program, 
we need to remember that it is form in painting that we explore.  Music, 
mathematics, geometry, and programming are not painting.  While they have 
their own beauty and their own avant-garde of creative practitioners, the 
goals of these various abstract processes are different from those of 
painting.   They hold a different kind of content and cannot replace the 
usefulness of painting.
<p>
	Connecting visual material with sound began with musicians whose 
perspective was that of music.  It brings us to the question of whether we 
are adding visual material to music, sound to pictures, or trying to combine 
two wholly separate media with millennia of history behind each.  
<p>
	Most explorers hope to discover a principle that when fed into a 
machine would externalize what they believed was imagery inherent in music.  
They called their work 'visual music'.  Some recent explorers have tried 
to find a principle that would generate both sound and image and thus 
guarantee their equality and coherence.  Some artists come with a background 
in painting, like myself, and consider that sound is an attribute of shapes 
as experienced in reality and thus is another of the dimensions of 
painting.(30)  
 <p>
<h3>ARTISTS WHO PROGRAM STATIC ABSTRACTION</h3>
<p>
	In the following cursory survey no value judgment about the efforts 
of my fellow artists is intended nor is the survey complete.  I briefly 
describe their work and make formal distinctions. 
<p>
	Artists who produce static pictures are generally interested in 
series of images that test controlled variables.  The repetition and 
complexity of nature, with its seemingly infinite variation, is made part 
of the aesthetics of computed pictures through recursion.  Artists working 
in this way generally use plotters to make black and white line drawings.  
As algorithmic painters they are more developed than those who do kinetic 
work.  
<p>
	Two artists who produced a mature body of algorithmic computer 
drawings were Collete S. Bangert and Charles J. Bangert.  Their collaboration 
began in 1967.  The beauty of their work is first artistic, then algorithmic.  
It invokes the principles behind natural complexity.  They are pleased when 
viewers could not tell the difference between drawings done by hand and 
those drawn by plotter.  However, it is precisely the visual qualities, 
brought about by the medium of programming, that is most beautiful in their 
work.(31)
<p>
	In 1982 Roman Verostko began to develop a program he calls Hodos 
which directs a plotter armed with pens and brushes to paint.  The results 
are wonderful glowing painterly spaces made up of calligraphic strokes.  
He believes that "The computer ... is altering the way we perceive the 
world."(32)  Verostko wrote, "If you are able to describe the artistic 
procedure, however uniquely individual, it will be possible to write the 
code."(33)  It points to the fact that most of our work is algorithmic by 
nature.  If we become conscious of the procedures, then we have gained 
insight and are ready to advance our work. 
<p>
	Manfred Mohr, who has his beginnings in jazz improvisation, opted 
for the control computing can give his creativity.  An illusion of a cube 
is used as a basic element, which he then subjects to transformation.  
Processes such as adding, subtracting, sequencing, combining, restricting, 
framing, orienting, and more produce black and white paintings and drawings.  
The entire process from algorithm to hard copy is under intuitive 
control.(34)  
<p>
<h3>COMPUTED KINETIC ABSTRACTIONS</h3>
<p>
	The first recognized master of kinetic computer imagery with sound 
was John Whitney.  "I asked repeatedly what visual elementals might match 
the scales of tones of music...free to explore, I soon found that for the 
first time in history, visual periodicity and harmonics were accessible to 
dynamic manipulation through the instrument of computer graphics."(35)  A 
visionary, Whitney went directly to the heart of his curiosity and found 
himself building and inventing electronic machines.  
<p>
	In "Permutations," (1968)(38) and "Arabesque," (1975)(37) he 
delineates a marvelous and exciting new world.  One senses a choreographer.  
The movements are reminiscent of traditional ballet.  The shapes follow the 
dictates of formal geometry more than those of abstract painting.  Movement 
is three-dimensional and the ambition for a more polished three-dimensional 
shaded space is apparent.
<p>
	In 1968 an important exhibition marked the emergence of electronic 
as distinct from mechanical kinetic paintings.  It was sponsored by 
Experiments in Art and Technology(38) in collaboration with the Brooklyn Museum 
and with the Museum of Modern Art.(39)  What is pertinent to the subject of 
this paper are the abstract works which were based on computer programs.  
At the time these pieces were called "computer-generated films."  Aaron 
Marcus, Duane Palyka, and Stan Vanderbeek in collaboration with Kenneth C. 
Knowlton,  exhibited geometric abstractions.  All of them utilized geometry 
in the way Whitney did.  A later film by Vanderbeek called "Euclidean 
Illusions," (1979)(40) uses geometric form and delineates all movement in a 
three dimensional space with perspective.  However, Vanderbeek later 
published "Spectrum 6" which was more abstract in its space.(41)
<p>
<h3>CONTEMPORARY KINETIC ABSTRACTIONISTS</h3>
<p>
	In 1979 Robert R. Snyder began designing and building an image 
processor connected to an equal-tempered keyboard.  He described it as 
being able to produce five colors in as many areas of the screen.  Snyder, 
a musician, attempted to control a "luminous envelope" structured to 
coordinate with musical events.   His videos are not abstract, although his 
keyboard image processor is capable of it.   His work is significant to the 
development of kinetic painting performed in real time with musicians.(42)
<p>
	Bryan Evans is primarily a musician searching for "one principle as 
the generative device for both music and graphic materials".(43)  He 
describes an algorithmic "black box" which produces output  translatable by 
various artists into their respective media.(44)  To integrate sound and 
picture, he focuses on mathematical and fractal principles.  His work then 
is an attempt at visualizing music.  The color of his shapes is variegated 
and graduated in lighting.  It gives the illusion of shading and that 
hampers the interaction of shape and color in an abstract space.  
<p>
	Lynn Pocock earned a degree in computer science followed by one in 
computer graphics.  She considers her work to be visual music and her 
"interest has been to represent the structure and emotional content of music 
in a visual form."(45)  It is, however, balanced between the two.  She has used 
the methods of artificial intelligence to model the work of Wassily 
Kandinski.  Another project uses a stream of musical information which is 
analyzed and which, through a rule-based system, is made to select from a 
pool of graphical fragments.  As the stream is processed, the graphical 
events are sequenced.(46)  Pocock's work is not all abstract.  Her contributions 
in the use of artificial intelligence to formulate a method whereby sound 
and picture can be manipulated simultaneously is significant. 
<p>
	Primarily a visual artist, Edward Zajec creates kinetic paintings 
that take music as a point of departure.  His kinetic painting titled 
"Chroma," 1987,  is made up of four sets of static pictures.  Each set 
contains six to twelve pictures.  Principles that he calls "thematic 
dissolves," "dimensional upgrades," and "thematic transformations" are then 
used to cause forms to interact.  Zajec is aware of abstract motion and very 
concerned with the "articulation of color and form in time."  He is also 
conscious that this motion is different from animation created as though 
seen through a lens.  He writes that "to animate means to orchestrate the 
flow of color passages in time, rather than to choreograph the motions of 
objects in space."(47)
<p>
<h3>CONCLUSION</h3>
<p>
	In kinetic abstract painting, computer technology has not been 
sufficiently explored by painters for sophisticated formal methods to 
develop.  The visual language for such painting is still nascent.
<p>
	The four formal attributes that are apparent at present are the 
rhythmic sequencing of noisy shapes and lines in time, the visual 
manifestation of digital programming form, the influence of memory on 
sequencing, and kinetic color.  Kinetic color is when the color of shapes 
changes in real time.  Snyder called it "time-variant color 
progressions."(48)
<p>
	The marvelous new technology is here capable of fulfilling the 
most optimistic dreams of the pioneers of abstraction.  Why are there only a 
few practitioners?  Maybe it is because, unlike the pioneers of abstraction, 
we do not yet have reason to dream with enthusiasm about a future society.  
We do not yet know a new content that might invigorate abstract kinetic 
painting.

<h3>ENDNOTES</h3>
<p>
1.  Form in painting comprises systems of rules and methods applied to color, 
shape, and line to convey ideas expediently.  Technique or technology is a 
system of rules and methods that make the visual concretization of form 
possible.  Content is the ideas held by technique and form -- medium is all 
three together..

25.  Directional illumination is a term in the formal language of three-
dimensional painting.  It describes light that comes from one or more known 
directions.  Such illumination requires stability on the part of the seeing 
eye of the artist, who sees a graduated lighting on surfaces as they recede 
from the source of light.   Shading is used to imitate this reality.  Color 
is the local attribute of the shaded surfaces of objects. 
<br>
26.   Mikhail Matyushin, one of the early Soviet painters, did extensive 
work with his students investigating the effects of context on color and 
the interaction of color.  He wrote that the new society and technology
