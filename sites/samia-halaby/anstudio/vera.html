This is Vera Tamari's self portrait and a view of her studio.  The self portrait dates from 1994 and measures 15 x 18 x 14 inches.  Tamari makes bas-relief pictures from clay.  She glazes and fires them herself.  Often she assembles the single pictures from several pieces.  Sections of the relief picture are articulated with glazes and sometimes limited sections are painted with other media.  On occasion, her bas-relief works are manipulated to exist as sculpture in the round.

On the left is "Rhythms of the Past II" measuring 10 x 17 x 14 inches done in 1994, a sculptural table-top work made up of small pictorial relieve works.  On the right is "Rhythms of the Land"
<p>
        I fell in love with her work when I first saw it at an 
exhibition at the United Nations in New York.  As a painter, I was upset at
finding that they were made of 
fired clay.  How could something so fine be made of such fragile breakable
materials.  Tamari had made things worse by making those relief works large and 
thin.

Three still life relief works dating from 1994 and 1995. They measure between 7 and 14 inches.

        During the past two springs I had an opportunity to visit Palestine
and became acquainted with Vera.  One evening we sat outside the door in the modest shadow of a small tree by the flowers she had planted.  We valued the modest garden and the modest moment of peace in the fragile conditions of existence in an oppressed nation.  As we talked about her art, I learnt
something about the aesthetics of fragility which so absorbed me on first
seeing her work.  I began to wonder if this fragility is a metaphor for 
all the destruction we Palestinians have seen of our homes and families.

On the left is "family" and, on the right is "Margo and Marie".  Both are 14" x 10" and were done in 1993.  These wonderful family scenes are like intimate little snap-shots.  Tender views of old sisters and family groups with gestures familiar to me
from my own family.  I found them sweet and moving.  Vera Tamari is 
impressive in the way in which she makes beauty from the things we 
take for granted.  
<p>
        Vera Tamari was born in Yafa and now lives in one of the small
bits of Palestine left to us after the onslaught of Israeli settlers.  She
teaches drawing, design, and mixed media at the University of BeirZeit.
