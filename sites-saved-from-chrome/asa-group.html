Jerusalem, It was in Jerusalem and from Al-Burak western wall, that prophet Mohammed (Peace Be Upon Him) ascended to hearkens. It was built by the ancient Kananites over 45 centuries ago.
 "Salem" throughout glorious history was distinguished with its over whelming hospitality, never denying anyone its citizenship. 
In 1948, Jewish forces, led by Menahem Begin, occupied 62% of Jerusalem except the old city, which was occupied in 1967, as well as the eastern part of the city.
Arab and Palestinian fighters did their best to defend their land and people. On April 8th, 1948, Abd El-Qader Hussaini became a myrter, together with thousands of myrters fighting against the fierce British attacks on Jerusalem and the greedy attempts to occupy the land and disperse the residents.
Jewish forces, led by Menahem Begin, committed terrible crimes and massacres against villages. The Deir Yassein and Khanyounis  massacres are only two examples. The attack continued in different ways to change the structure of 38 villages around Jerusalem alone. Some villages were completely destroyed, or colonized by Jewish settlers.

Jerusalem is rich in its archaeological and historical buildings, especially Islamic ones. It contains about 100 centers, such as mosques, schools, castles mentioned in historical books, some of which cannot even be seen today. All of these traces of the old civilization were found in Jerusalem, although it was never a political center in Islamic eras.
Jerusalem is important for all the Christians churches as well as the Muslims for it has the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.
<center><blink><font color="#FF0000">Al-Aqsa Mosque.</font></blink></center>
Al-Aqsa Mosque, located at the southern part of Al-Haram Al-Shareef esplanade, was built between 705-717 A.D by the Ommayyad Caliph Al Waleed Bin Abdul-Malik. In spite of the continuous renovations, that were carried out from time to time, the mosque maintained its genuine Islamic Architecture thus acquiring a universal reputation of uniqueness and beauty. The interior of the mosque consists of seven hallways ornamented with wooden engravings and decorations.

Muslims respect and revere Jesus (upon him be peace). They consider him one of the greatest of God's prophets and messengers to humankind. A Muslim never refers to him simply as "Jesus", but always adds the phrase "upon him be peace." The Qur'an confirms his virgin birth, and a special surah (chapter) of the Qur'an is entitled "Mary." The Qur'an describes the Annunciation as follows: 

"'Behold (O Mary!)' The Angel said, 'God has chosen you, and purified you, and chosen you above the women of all nations. O Mary, God gives you good news of a word from Him, whose name shall be the Anointed (Masih or Messiah), Jesus son of Mary, honored in this world and in the hereafter, and one of those brought near to God. He shall speak to the people from his cradle and in maturity, and shall be of the righteous.' 

"She said: 'O my Lord! How shall I have a son when no man has touched me?' He said: 'Even so; God creates what He wills. When He decrees a thing, He says to it, "Be!" and it is.'" (Qur'an 3:42-7) 

Jesus (upon him be peace) was born miraculously through the same power that had brought Adam into being without a father: "Truly the likeness of Jesus with God is as the likeness of Adam. He created him of dust and then said to him, 'Be!' and he was." (Qur'an 3:59) 

During his prophetic mission, Jesus performed many miracles. The Qur'an tells us that he said:
"I have come to you with a sign from your Lord: I make for you out of clay, as it were, a figure of a bird, and breathe into it and it becomes a bird by God's leave. And I heal the blind, and the lepers, and I raise the dead by God's leave." (Qur'an 3:49) 

Neither Muhammad nor Jesus (upon them be peace) came to change the basic doctrine of the belief in One God, brought by earlier prophets, but to confirm and renew it. In the Qur'an, Jesus (upon him be peace) is reported as saying that he came: "To attest the law which was before me. And to make lawful to you part of what was forbidden to you; I have come to you with a sign from your Lord, so fear God and obey me." (Qur'an 3:50) 

The Prophet Muhammad (upon him be peace) said:
"Whoever believes that there is none worthy of worship but God, alone without partner, that Muhammad is His messenger, that Jesus is the servant and messenger of God, His word which He bestowed on Mary and a spirit proceeding from Him, and that Paradise and Hell are true, shall be received by God into Heaven." (A Hadith (saying) from the collections of al Bukhari)
