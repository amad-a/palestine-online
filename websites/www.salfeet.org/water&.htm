<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">Salfeet Municipality started supplying citizens with water in 1955
through installing water taps in different local quarters. In 1957 , houses were connected
with the network . Ein Alseka local spring supplied houses with water. And in 1968 the
municipality installed a pipeline to connect&nbsp;Al Matwi spring with the network in
order to supply people with their need of water . This situation continued till 1985 when
the water network was connected with Water Company in order to meet the increasing need of
the people. The water network was maintained twice : the first in 1980 with 15 Km long,
and the second project was in 1997 which included 20 Km long, construction of two
reserviors and the installation of two water pumps. Due to the limited available
resources, water is one of the most important issues in Palestine. So in order to develop
this service and to reduce&nbsp; the water loss amounting 40 %, it is very important to
implement the following projects:</p>

<ol>
  <ol>
    <li>Implementing a new water pipeline to connect Al-Matwi with the city of 6 Kilometers long
      and of 6 inches diameter.</li>
    <li>Providing different spare parts for the city water project.</li>
    <li>Providing a workshop for repairing the equipment and&nbsp; maintenance.</li>
    <li>Implementing the 10 inches diameter pipeline to connect the city main reservoir with the
      main water resource of 3 Km long. This pipeline will enable the City of Salfeet and the
      nearby villages to make use of our full share of water amounting 600.000 m3/year according
      to the Oslo Peace Agreement. This line needs only implementation; the municipality has
      already prepared the necessary pipelines and other accessories.</li>
    <li>The cost of carrying out these projects is Us $ 500.000</li>
  </ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The Sewerage Project:</b></p>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The local current technique in Salfeet depends on the absorption holes
beside each building. When full, people pump out sewage out of the holes and take their
contents to the outside fields. This process is very difficult, harmful to public health
and causes environmental pollution. To confront this major issue the municipality has
prepared the necessary plans for a complete drain network and purification pools to serve
all the inhabitants of the city. This project includes:</p>

<ol>
  <li>Implementing the lines of drains to the city different parts.</li>
  <li>Establishing stations for purification and refining in order to reuse the treated water.</li>
</ol>

<p ALIGN="JUSTIFY">The cost of this project is US $ 10 millions contributed by the KFW
bank of Germany as a donation to the City and the Palestinian People. Meanwhile the GTZ is
sponsoring and arranging for the technical support for the municipality as a parallel and
integral program.</p>
